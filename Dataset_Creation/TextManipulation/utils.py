def _get_char_ranges(ranges: list[str], delimiter: str, current_pos: int = 0) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Calculates the character index ranges for a list of text segments, accounting for delimiters.

    This function iterates over a list of strings (e.g., paragraphs, tokens, sections), and returns
    their character start and end positions in the full text. It assumes that the segments are joined
    by a consistent delimiter, which is included in the position calculation.

    Args:
        ranges (list[str]):
            The list of text segments (e.g., paragraphs or tokens) for which to compute character ranges.
        delimiter (str):
            The delimiter string used to separate the segments in the original text (e.g., "\n\n").
        current_pos (int, optional):
            The starting character index of the first segment. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]:
            A list of [start, end] pairs representing the character ranges for each segment.
            The `start` index is inclusive, and the `end` index is exclusive.

    Finds all minimal-length sequences of consecutive paragraphs whose combined character count
    meets or exceeds a given threshold.

    The function returns only the minimal valid sequence from each starting paragraph â€” that is,
    it stops expanding a sequence as soon as the threshold is reached, avoiding overlong combinations.

    Args:
        paragraphs (list[str]):
            List of paragraph strings to evaluate.
        char_ranges (list[list[int]]):
            Character index ranges for each paragraph, where each range is [start, end].
            These must align with the `paragraphs` list.
        min_chars (int):
            Minimum total character count required for a paragraph sequence to be considered valid.

    Returns:
        list[tuple[list[str], dict[tuple[int, int], list[list[int]]]]]:
