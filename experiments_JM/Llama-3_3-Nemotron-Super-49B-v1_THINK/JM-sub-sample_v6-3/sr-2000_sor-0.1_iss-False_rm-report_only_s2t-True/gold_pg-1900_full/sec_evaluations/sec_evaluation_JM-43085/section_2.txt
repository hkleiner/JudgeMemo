Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately using the given scales.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is a biographical passage about Meissonier's early career. Scanning through, the language seems formal and old-fashioned, which might affect fluency for modern readers, but that's not necessarily an error. Checking for grammatical issues: I notice some complex sentence structures, like "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close." That's a bit awkward but grammatically correct. Are there any actual errors? The sentence "Be one's tastes never so modest..." uses "one's" correctly. Another point: "the privilege of dining at home once a week"—"once a week" might feel a bit old in phrasing but isn't wrong. The use of semicolons and commas seems appropriate. Maybe some phrases are wordy, like "in the midst of this resurrection of a past that was still quite recent," but that's style, not an error. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 4.5. The main issues could be minor, like slightly archaic language affecting readability but no major errors.

Now Coherence. The passage follows Meissonier's struggles and early successes. The structure moves chronologically: from his early training, financial struggles, first exhibitions, and then success with illustrations. Transitions between paragraphs seem logical. For example, after discussing his financial hardships, it moves to how he got work with Curmer, then the success with The Indian Cabin. However, there's a jump from the success of The Indian Cabin to quoting a contemporary and describing specific artworks. The transition there could be smoother. Also, the paragraph starting "And then, in the words of one of his contemporaries" introduces a new quote without clear attribution initially (though later mentioned as a critic). That might cause a slight disjoint. Also, the chapter title "FIRST SUCCESS" is part of the text; does that affect coherence within the segment? Probably not since it's a header. The main issue might be the abrupt quote insertion and perhaps some dense descriptions without clear connectors. So Coherence could be a 4, with some minor weaknesses but overall logical flow.

Finalizing scores: Fluency is mostly fluent with minor stylistic choices that don't hinder understanding—maybe 4.5. Coherence has a few transitions that could be better but generally holds together, so 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary/phrasing (e.g., "be one's tastes never so modest," "in the midst of this resurrection of a past") may impede modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift into the quoted critic’s description of *The Indian Cabin* illustrations without clear contextual setup.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjoint between the biographical narrative and detailed art descriptions (e.g., pipe of English leather).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
