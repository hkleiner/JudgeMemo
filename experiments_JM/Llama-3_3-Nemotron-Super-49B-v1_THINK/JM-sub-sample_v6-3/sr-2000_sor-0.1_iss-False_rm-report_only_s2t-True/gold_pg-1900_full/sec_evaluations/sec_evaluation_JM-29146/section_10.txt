Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text seems mostly well-written, but I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. Scanning through the Current Segment, I notice a few places where the sentence structure might be a bit off or word choice could be improved. For example, "It was personal. She wouldn't understand. Mystic experience always is like that." The transition here feels a bit abrupt. Also, "And yet, with the conviction that only a mystic can have--although he certainly was no mystic--Ramsey knew..." is a long sentence with a complex structure that might disrupt flow slightly. There's also "He stood before it, looking in. The hackles rose on his neck." The subject changes abruptly from Ramsey's action to the reaction (hackles rising) without a clear connector. These are minor but noticeable.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect logically and the overall structure. The segment has a clear narrative flow, but there are some jumps. For instance, when Vardin explains about the Proto-man and the creation of life, the transition from the fight scene to this explanatory dialogue might feel a bit sudden. Also, the part where Garr Symm transforms into a caveman-like figure and then the scene shifts to Vardin leading him away without much explanation might confuse some readers. Additionally, the ending where Margot suddenly says "I love you" after being subdued feels a bit rushed without clear emotional buildup in this segment (though context from previous parts might help, but we're evaluating this segment alone). The resolution also wraps up quickly with Vardin disappearing and the conclusion, which might lack smooth transitions.

For Fluency score: Mostly fluent but with some minor issues. Maybe a 4? Because the issues are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much.

For Coherence score: Generally coherent but with some abrupt transitions and unclear connections. Maybe a 3.5? Because while the main narrative flows, there are noticeable disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence transitions (e.g., "It was personal. She wouldn’t understand.") - [LEXICON] Occasionally forced or overly complex phrasing (e.g., "with the conviction that only a mystic can have--although he certainly was no mystic") - [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness in action descriptions (e.g., "The hackles rose on his neck" without clear subject flow)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts from action to exposition (e.g., Vardin’s backstory after combat) - [CLARITY] Unclear emotional resolution (Margot’s "I love you" feels unearned in this segment) - [LOGIC] Rushed conclusion with unresolved plot threads (Vardin’s disappearance, Garr’s transformation)  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
