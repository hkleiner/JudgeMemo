Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice that the dialogue seems a bit forced in some places. For example, when Margot says, "I told you to shut up. I have to think." followed by Ramsey's comment about a tri-di actress, the exchange feels a bit unnatural. The transition from Margot's anger to discussing figures and then Ramsey's sarcastic remark might disrupt the flow slightly. Also, there are some lengthy, complex sentences, like the part where Ramsey thinks about molecular activity and hyper-space concepts. These could make the reading a bit cumbersome, though they're mostly clear.

For Coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the structure is sound. The segment starts with Ramsey's internal thoughts, then moves to the ship's situation, the confrontation with Margot, and the scientific explanations. The transition from the action (Margot threatening Ramsey) to the explanatory thoughts about hyper-space time and the environment checks seems a bit abrupt. For instance, after the intense threat, the discussion about temperature and gravity might feel like a shift without a smooth transition. Also, the introduction of Vardin's role and Margot's decision to take her outside could be clearer. The narrative jumps between different elements—action, dialogue, internal monologues—without always connecting them seamlessly.

Now, assigning scores. For Fluency, despite some forced dialogue and complex sentences, the text is generally readable. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has minor issues. For Coherence, the abrupt shifts and some unclear transitions might warrant a 3.5, as it's generally coherent but has noticeable problems.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Forced dialogue exchanges (e.g., Margot-Ramsey banter) disrupt natural flow.  
   - [LEXICON] Overly complex scientific explanations (e.g., "time does not exist in hyper-space") may hinder readability.  
   - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in sentence structure (e.g., abrupt shifts from thoughts to dialogue).  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between action, internal monologues, and sci-fi explanations (e.g., threat sequence → environmental stats).  
   - [LOGIC] Margot’s sudden ability to deduce Ramsey’s thoughts feels unearned.  
   - [CLARITY] Vardin’s role and motivations are underdeveloped.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
