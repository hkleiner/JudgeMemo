Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. The text is a sci-fi excerpt, so I have to read through it carefully.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The first thing I notice is the consistent lisp in the Irwadian's dialogue, like "thith" and "lithense". That's intentional for characterization, so not a fluency issue. Checking for grammar and spelling mistakes... The text seems well-written. Wait, there's "Your name ith Jathon Ramthey?" – the name is spelled differently than Jason Ramsey. Is that a typo or intentional? Maybe a typo, but since the character corrects it, maybe it's just the officer's mistake. Not sure if that's a fluency problem. The rest of the sentences flow well. Maybe some long sentences, but they're structured properly. No obvious grammar or spelling errors. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 5, but let me check again.

For Coherence, it's about how the story unfolds logically. The scene starts with Ramsey at the port, then moves to him dealing with the ship being grounded, then to his conversation with Englander. Each part connects to the planetarization issue. There's a shift when the Earthgirl reads Chind's mind and leaves, but that seems like a plot point introduction. The transitions between scenes are clear. The dialogue between Ramsey and Englander follows naturally from the situation. However, the part with the Earthgirl feels a bit abrupt. She appears, thinks about panic, and then the scene cuts to Ramsey talking to Englander without clear connection. That might be a coherence issue – abrupt transition. Also, the explanation about titanium and Irwadi's importance feels a bit info-dumpy, but it's integrated through Chind's thoughts. So Coherence might be a 4, with some minor issues but overall logical flow.

Wait, the Earthgirl's section: she leaves the ship, thinks about panic, then suddenly "So that's about the size of it," Ramsey says. There's no transition between her leaving and Ramsey's conversation. That's a jump. So that's a coherence problem. Also, the introduction of the Earthgirl might not be fully integrated yet, but since it's a segment from a larger text, maybe it's setting up something later. But within this segment, the transition is abrupt. So Coherence score might be 4 because the main flow is logical, but there's that one abrupt shift.

Fluency: No major issues, so 5. Coherence: 4 due to the abrupt scene change but otherwise coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Intentional lisp in dialogue may slightly hinder readability for some readers.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Earthgirl’s panic to Ramsey’s conversation without clear connection.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
