Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text is a descriptive piece, likely from an old travelogue or ethnographic account. The language seems formal and detailed. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues.

Reading through the current segment, the sentences are long and complex, but they mostly flow well. There are some archaic terms and constructions ("your eye was caught at once"), which might affect readability but aren't errors. I notice a few possible issues: "a couple of rather more capacious houses" – "capacious" might be less common, but it's correct. "Four-cornered beams" is a bit odd, maybe "square" beams? But it's descriptive and clear. The structure of sentences varies, which helps fluency. However, some sentences are very long, like the one describing the temple's architecture. That could interrupt flow, but the author uses commas effectively. No obvious grammatical errors, though "is all that is to be seen" is a bit repetitive but grammatically okay. Maybe some slight awkwardness in phrases like "owing probably to Ma-t'idu's sending me an escort," but it's understandable. Overall, the text is mostly fluent with minor, noticeable issues. So Fluency score might be 4.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connectivity of ideas. The text describes the monastery, its buildings, the lamas' practices, interactions with the author, and the departure. The sections transition between physical descriptions, cultural practices, and personal experiences. Are there abrupt shifts? The text moves from architecture to the lamas' numbers and their behavior, then to the gegen, tombs, religious practices, financial support, and finally the author's departure. Each part connects to the monastery's description. However, there might be some disjointedness between detailed architectural descriptions and sudden shifts to the lamas' fear of instruments or the departure scene. For example, after describing the temple's interior, it jumps to the lamas' fear of anthropological tools. That's a bit abrupt but still within the context of the monastery visit. The structure is generally logical, with each paragraph focusing on a different aspect but all related to K'anglungssu. Maybe a slight lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs, but overall coherent. So Coherence score around 4 as well, maybe 4.5 if transitions are considered mostly smooth despite some shifts.

Wait, let me check again. The part about the lamas' fear and the author leaving feels like a conclusion, but the transition from the temple description to the lamas' behavior might be a bit sudden. However, since it's all part of the visit, it's still coherent. The text doesn't have major inconsistencies or illogical sequences. So Coherence is mostly high, maybe a 4.5. But the criteria for 5 requires "minor lapses barely noticeable." If the transitions are slightly weak but not disruptive, maybe 4.5. Alternatively, if the shifts between different aspects (architecture, people, departure) are noticeable but don't disrupt much, then 4.

Fluency: The main issues are long sentences and some less common vocabulary, but no errors. So minor issues, score 4.

Coherence: Mostly coherent with some slight shifts but no major disruptions, so 4.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, complex sentences may impede immediate clarity. - [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "capacious houses") and less common terms (e.g., "four-cornered beams") require brief pauses for interpretation.
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Subtle abruptness between architectural descriptions and interpersonal/cultural details (e.g., shift from temple layout to lamas’ fear of instruments). - [STRUCTURE] Minor repetition in thematic focus (e.g., repeated emphasis on Buddhist icons without explicit connective tissue).
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
