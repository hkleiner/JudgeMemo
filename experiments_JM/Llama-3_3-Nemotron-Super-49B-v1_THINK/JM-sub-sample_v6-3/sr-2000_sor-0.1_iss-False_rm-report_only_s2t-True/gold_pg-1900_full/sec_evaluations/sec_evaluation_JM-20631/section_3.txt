Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., ensuring smooth reading. The text here is quite dense and filled with complex sentences. There are long, elaborate sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the part about Jesus looking forward to his twelve legions and seat at the right hand of Power is a bit convoluted. Also, the quotation from Isaiah has archaic language ("Mine elect", "delighteth"), which might affect fluency for modern readers. However, despite the complexity and some archaic terms, the structure is mostly well-organized. I didn't spot any grammatical errors, but the phrasing is sometimes awkward due to length and old-fashioned vocabulary. So Fluency might be a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has minor issues from complexity and outdated language.

Now Coherence. This looks at how ideas are connected and the overall logical flow. The section discusses the ethical themes in the Old Testament, contrasts self-regarding vs. idealistic motives, uses the Pontius Pilate example, then dives into Jewish liturgy and the concept of being chosen for universal service. There's a transition to discussing whether the Torah created the people's greatness or vice versa, then moves to examples from the Old Testament (Job, Psalms) to show universalism. The structure seems logical, connecting each point to the main theme of Judaism's idealism. However, there are some abrupt jumps, like moving from the Pontius Pilate story directly to discussing Jesus's expectations, or shifting from historical examples to literary analysis (Isaiah, Psalms). Also, the mention of Mr. Wells' book feels a bit out of place without more context, but it's used to counter a criticism. The coherence is generally good but has a few disconnected parts. So Coherence might score a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak connections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "delighteth," "thou") and overly formal tone may impede readability for modern audiences.  
- [SYNTAX] Extremely long, complex sentences with nested clauses (e.g., Jesus’ expectation of "twelve legions of angels") risk awkward pacing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Pontius Pilate anecdote to discussing Jesus’ motivations without clear bridging.  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential critique of Mr. Wells’ book disrupts flow, though it serves a defensive purpose.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
