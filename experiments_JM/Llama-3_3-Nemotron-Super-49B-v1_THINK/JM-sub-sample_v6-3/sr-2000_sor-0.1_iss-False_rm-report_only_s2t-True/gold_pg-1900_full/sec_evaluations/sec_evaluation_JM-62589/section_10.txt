Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text to spot any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The text seems mostly well-written, but there are a few spots. For example, "Shirtliffe’s white face haunted him" – "haunted" might be a bit strong, but maybe it's intentional for dramatic effect. Then, "as soon as I can I will take a look at him again" could be rephrased for smoother flow, like "as soon as I can, I will..." The comma after "can" is missing. Another point: "No hand but his operated on the ghastly wound" – the phrase "No hand but his" is a bit archaic but correct. "Tremblingly she raised her eyes" should probably be "Trembling, she raised her eyes" for better syntax. Also, "the wine choked her" might be better as "the wine choked in her throat" for clarity. These are minor, so Fluency might be a 4, as they're noticeable but don't disrupt readability much.

Now Coherence. The story flows logically from the surgeon's concern to Debby's revelation and the resolution with Washington. However, there's a shift when Doctor Bell decides to take her to his mother and then mentions writing to England. The connection between these actions and the previous plot could be smoother. Also, the transition to Chapter X feels a bit abrupt without showing the passage of time explicitly. Additionally, when Debby meets Washington, the scene shifts quickly from her entering to being told to wait, then returning. The structure is mostly clear, but some transitions could be better. Maybe a score of 4 here too, as the issues are minor but present.

Wait, let me check again. For Coherence, the main points are logical sequence and transitions. The part where Doctor Bell says he'll take her to his mother and write to England might feel a tad disconnected from the immediate context of her discharge. Also, the chapter title "DEBBY COMES INTO HER OWN AT LAST" might indicate a new phase, but within the segment, the flow from the hospital to Washington's office to the Quaker mother's home is mostly logical. The only weak point is perhaps the abruptness of the chapter start, but since it's a chapter title, maybe that's acceptable. So Coherence score might still be 4, with some minor weaknesses.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor issues, mostly clear), Coherence 4 (mostly logical with a couple minor transitions).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Missing or misplaced commas for clarity (e.g., "as soon as I can I will").  
- [LEXICON] Occasionally formal/archaic phrasing ("haunted him," "No hand but his").  
- [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "Tremblingly she raised her eyes").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Slight abruptness in transitioning to Chapter X without explicit time cues.  
- [TRANSITION] Mild disconnect between Doctor Bell’s plan to contact England and preceding scenes.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
