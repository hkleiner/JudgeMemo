Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Let me read through the current segment carefully.

The text starts with "He was then made to get on the carabao's back..." That seems okay. Then, "the aforesaid pedagogues lay down on the sugar-cane pulp..." Wait, "aforesaid" might be a bit formal or archaic. Is that a problem? Maybe it's a style choice, but in modern writing, it's less common. Not sure if that's a fluency issue or just vocabulary choice. 

Next sentence: "Being uncertain but that some of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops..." The phrase "uncertain but that" is a bit awkward. Normally, we say "uncertain that" or "fearing that". "Uncertain but that" might be a grammatical error. That's a syntax issue. 

Then, "we at first agreed that neither of us should go to sleep, but it was later decided..." The structure here is a bit long, but it's a compound sentence with a contrast, so maybe okay. 

Later: "so both took a revolver in each hand, stretched out supinely and went to sleep." "Supinely" is a less common word. It means lying on the back, which fits, but might cause a pause for some readers. Not sure if that's a fluency issue or just advanced vocabulary. 

The next paragraph: "Such a sleep! The rough jolting..." The exclamation mark here is okay for emphasis. Then, "When we awoke the blazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning..." "Past the midday mark" is a bit wordy. Maybe "past midday" would be smoother. 

"A pack of dogs were heralding our approach..." Subject-verb agreement: "A pack... were" should be "was" since "pack" is singular. That's a grammar error. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are:
- "Uncertain but that" (syntax error)
- "A pack of dogs were" (grammar error, subject-verb agreement)
- Possibly "aforesaid" and "supinely" as less common words, but maybe acceptable in the context of the writing style. Since the text has a somewhat antiquated tone (mentions "ladrone", "carabao", etc.), maybe those are intentional. But the syntax and grammar errors are clearer deductions.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas flow logically. The segment starts with the native on the carabao, then the pedagogues in the cart, deciding on sleep, then the sleep, waking up to the sun, and arriving at a village. The transitions seem logical. Each paragraph connects to the next action in sequence. However, the jump from waking up to "A pack of dogs were heralding our approach" might feel a bit abrupt. There's no transition sentence explaining how they got from the cart ride to approaching the village. It just suddenly happens. That's a transition issue. 

Also, the part about procuring ponies to take them back to the post comes out of nowhere. The previous context mentioned returning, but in the current segment, after waking up, they're at a village getting ponies. The connection between the cart ride ending and getting ponies isn't clearly explained. Maybe that's a structure or clarity issue. 

So Coherence issues:
- Abrupt transition from waking up to approaching the village with dogs.
- Sudden introduction of procuring ponies without clear connection to previous actions.

Scoring Fluency: There are two clear grammar errors and one syntax issue. The errors are noticeable but don't make the text unreadable. So maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally readable but has multiple issues.

Coherence: The transitions are a problem, and the introduction of the village and ponies feels disconnected. But the overall sequence of events (ride, sleep, wake, arrive) is logical. So maybe a 3? Because it's generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] "Uncertain but that" (incorrect phrasing)  
   - [GRAMMAR] "A pack of dogs were" (subject-verb agreement error)  
   - [LEXICON] "Supinely" (less common vocabulary)  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from sleep to village arrival  
   - [CLARITY] Sudden introduction of ponies without contextual bridge  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
