Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to evaluate the Fluency and Coherence of the given text segment. The user provided a previous section, but I shouldn't consider that for scoring. Let me start with Fluency.

Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. I notice long, complex sentences. For example, the part about the bookman calculating shillings and negotiating prices is a bit winding. There are also some outdated terms like "to-morrow" instead of "tomorrow," but that's stylistic, not an error. Are there any actual grammatical mistakes? Let me check. The text uses phrases like "which for the moment he had forgotten" – that's correct. The structure is mostly sound, but the verbosity might make it less fluent for modern readers. Maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some awkward phrasing due to long sentences.

Now, Coherence. The text talks about the bookman's obsession, his sacrifices, justifications, and the comfort of books. The ideas seem to flow logically, each paragraph connecting to the theme. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like moving from the birthday gift scenario to discussing constant satisfaction in reading without a close season. The transitions between paragraphs might not be very smooth. For example, the part about Emerson's room feels a bit tacked on, though it supports the overall point. The structure is generally coherent, but there are minor disconnects. Maybe a Coherence score of 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak connections.

Wait, let me double-check. In Coherence, the main issue might be the transitions between different anecdotes. The section about the birthday present, then the comparison to other sportsmen, then the emotional benefits of books, and the heavenly paradise part. Each part relates to the bookman's character, but the jumps between these ideas could be smoother. However, the overall narrative is clear. So maybe Coherence is a 4, and Fluency a 4 as well, considering the style's impact on readability.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentence structures (e.g., "He has also anodynes for his conscience...") that impede smooth reading.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary/phrasing (e.g., "to-morrow," "fellow") that may distract modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., from self-justification to Emerson’s room anecdote) without clear connective tissue.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive thematic reinforcement (e.g., "his friends... will never play him false") without escalating depth.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
