Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability. I notice long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the part about the bookman's preferences and the comparison between different authors. These sentences are grammatically correct but might cause some difficulty in following due to their length and structure. There's also some use of outdated terms or references (like "roxburghe calf" editions) that a modern reader might not be familiar with, which could hinder fluency slightly. However, the grammar and spelling seem flawless. The vocabulary is rich but not overly obscure, contributing to a formal tone. So, the main fluency issue is the complex sentence structure leading to occasional awkwardness, but no errors. That would probably score a 4 because it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now, Coherence. The section discusses the bookman's preferences and contrasts lasting literature with popular works. The ideas are well-connected, moving from discussing specific authors to the critic's role and then to what constitutes a classic. There's a clear structure: each paragraph builds on the theme of literary appreciation and the distinction between transient and timeless works. Transitions between paragraphs seem smooth, like moving from Sainte-Beuve's quote to the cathedral vs. house analogy, and then to the bookman's collection. However, there might be a slight abruptness when shifting from the general discussion to specific book examples (e.g., jumping from Milton to Cellini), but these are still thematically linked. The overall logic is sound, with no major gaps or contradictions. So, coherence is strong, maybe a 5, but if there's a minor disconnect in transitions, perhaps a 4.5. But given the smooth flow and clear progression, I think 5 is appropriate.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentence structures may impede immediate readability.  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "roxburghe calf") and formal tone require contextual familiarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor thematic shifts (e.g., abrupt transitions between specific authorial examples) slightly disrupt flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
