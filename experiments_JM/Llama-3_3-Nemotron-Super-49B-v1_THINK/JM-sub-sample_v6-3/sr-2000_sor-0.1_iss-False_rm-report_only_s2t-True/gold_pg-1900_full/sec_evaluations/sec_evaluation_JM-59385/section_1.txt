Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but I notice some sentence structures that are a bit complex or wordy. For example, "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl." is clear, but maybe a bit formal. Also, there are a few places where the phrasing feels old-fashioned, like "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" – "passively quiet" is a bit unusual. Grammar seems okay, but some sentences are long and might cause a slight pause. No major errors, so Fluency is probably a 4.

Now Coherence. The story flows logically, each part connects to the next. The scene in the shop is well-described, and the flashback to the mission school feels relevant, showing Kuei Ping's character. However, the transition to the memory of the mission school feels a bit abrupt. The sentence "With a suddenness so abrupt..." introduces the flashback without much warning. That's a coherence issue because it disrupts the flow slightly. Otherwise, the narrative is clear and structured. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, but maybe 3.5 because of that abrupt transition.

Wait, the Coherence scale says a 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The abrupt transition is a notable issue but doesn't disrupt the whole flow. So maybe 4 for Coherence. But I need to check again. The memory shift is sudden, but the rest is well-connected. So perhaps 4 is right.

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (some minor phrasing issues but overall smooth), Coherence 4 (one transition issue but generally logical).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, overly formal sentence structures (e.g., "sat passively quiet")  
   - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("passively quiet," "lend light")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to Kuei Ping’s memory of the mission school (lacks explicit connector)  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*Fluency*: The text is highly fluent, with sophisticated vocabulary and mostly natural phrasing, despite minor archaisms and occasional awkward sentence constructions.  
*Coherence*: The narrative is logically structured and engaging, except for one jarring transition to a flashback, which slightly disrupts continuity.
