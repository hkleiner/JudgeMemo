Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully. The language seems quite formal and descriptive, which might be a bit archaic. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, the part about the soothsayers and the astrological calculations has multiple clauses stacked together. That could make the flow a bit awkward. Also, there are some word choices like "suffocation in the close room" which might be a bit dramatic but not incorrect. Are there any actual errors? I don't see obvious grammatical mistakes, but the sentence structure is sometimes dense. Maybe a few places where the phrasing feels a bit forced or old-fashioned, like "the culmination of the alliance had waited but the year to be set." The phrase "but the year" might be slightly unclear; perhaps "except for the year"? That's a minor point. Overall, the text is mostly fluent but with some cumbersome sentences that interrupt the flow slightly. So Fluency might be a 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The section seems to follow Kuei Ping's thoughts and the wedding preparation. There's a flashback to her past with Miss Porter, then back to the present with the wedding. The transitions between these parts need to be smooth. The narrative jumps from Kuei Ping's memories to the current wedding scene. Are the connections clear? The part where she thinks about her family's plans and her internal conflict is understandable. However, there's a section about the soothsayers and astrological matching that feels a bit detailed and might disrupt the flow if not well-integrated. The text explains the destiny and the auspicious signs, which is relevant to the arranged marriage theme. But the level of detail here might make the narrative feel a bit slow or heavy in that part. Also, when the scene cuts back to Kuei Ping in her room, the transitions are managed with phrases like "Kuei Ping, wearing the heavy wedding garments..." which helps. However, the shift from the detailed astrological explanation to the immediate wedding preparations might feel a tad abrupt. The ideas are logically connected (explaining why the marriage is happening), but the transition could be smoother. So Coherence is mostly good but with a slight disjointedness in the astrological section. Maybe a score of 4 as well, since the main flow is clear but there's a minor weakness.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures (e.g., "the culmination of the alliance had waited but the year to be set").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Mild abruptness shifting between detailed astrological backstory and immediate wedding scene (e.g., "When Kuei Ping was a child..." to "Kuei Ping, wearing the heavy wedding garments...").  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
