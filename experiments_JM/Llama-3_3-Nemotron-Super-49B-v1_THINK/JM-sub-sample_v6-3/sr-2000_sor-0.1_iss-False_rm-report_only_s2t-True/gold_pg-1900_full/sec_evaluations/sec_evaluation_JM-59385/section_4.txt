Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence from 1 to 5 with half-points.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is a narrative part of a story, probably from an older work given the style and context (mentions of Chinese traditions, terms like "mandarin robe", "Tartar City", etc.). 

Reading through the current segment, the language seems formal and somewhat archaic, which might affect fluency for modern readers but isn't necessarily an error. I need to check for actual grammatical issues. For example, sentences like "Men went out and beyond. Women in that far-away land from which Miss Porter came, walked, too, in similar paths of freedom." The structure here is a bit abrupt, with a short sentence followed by a longer one. The transition between sentences might feel a bit disjointed, but is it a fluency issue or coherence? Maybe both. 

Looking for grammar errors: "the crown of womanhood was the bearing of a son" – "bearing" might be intended, but "bearing a son" is correct. No obvious subject-verb issues. Punctuation seems mostly correct, though some sentences are long and complex, which could impact fluency. For example, "Carried by the devious ways of tongue and ear, by which news can travel the length of an empire without need of telephone wires, the knowledge of Kuei Ping’s hopes reached the heart of the Yen compound." That's a complex sentence but grammatically correct. 

Fluency issues might include some awkward phrasing, like "She felt the first stirring of a new life entrusted to her" – "entrusted" feels a bit formal but not wrong. Maybe "the devious ways of tongue and ear" is poetic but clear. So overall, the text is mostly fluent with some minor phrasing that's formal or slightly awkward but not erroneous. So Fluency score might be 4 or 4.5. 

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The segment starts with Kuei Ping outside, then moves to her emotions, her husband's return, family meetings, their departure, having a child, and daily life. The transitions between these scenes need to be smooth. 

For example, after describing the wood-rose and her feelings, it jumps to the morning routine, then to Fuh Tang's arrival. The connections are there because it's a narrative, but some transitions might be abrupt. Like moving from the emotional moment with the wood-rose to the structured daily duties. Also, when introducing Chang An's arrival, the context is provided but relies on understanding the previous family dynamics. Since the current segment is part of a larger work, some assumptions are made, but within this segment, does it hold together? 

The part where they decide to leave the family in disgrace and start a new life seems to follow logically from their conflict with tradition. Then the shift to Kuei Ping's pregnancy and preparations is a natural progression. The visit from Miss Porter and the birth scene also follow logically. However, some sections might feel a bit disconnected without the full context, but the segment itself explains enough. 

Potential coherence issues: The transition from the family tribunal scene to Kuei Ping's feelings of humiliation but hope might need clearer connection. Also, the introduction of Chang An coming to live with them is explained briefly but relies on understanding the family dynamics from prior context. Within this segment, it's manageable. 

So Coherence might score around 4, as there are minor transitions that could be smoother but overall the narrative flows logically.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "Carried by the devious ways of tongue and ear...") may disrupt modern readability.  
- [LEXICON] Formal, poetic vocabulary (e.g., "venturesome rose," "devious ways of tongue and ear") creates slight stiffness in tone.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between introspective moments (e.g., wood-rose symbolism) and practical scenes (e.g., embroidery, household duties) without clear bridging.  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Fuh Tang’s departure dilemma to Kuei Ping’s pregnancy preparations) assume contextual continuity not fully established within the excerpt.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
