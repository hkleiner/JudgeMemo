Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the provided text segment. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a narrative passage with descriptive elements. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues. 

Reading through the text, I notice that the sentences are generally well-structured. There are long, descriptive paragraphs, especially the sunrise scene, but they seem poetic and intentional. However, there might be some overly complex sentences that could cause a slight pause. For example, the description of the sunrise has multiple clauses without clear punctuation, which might make it a bit hard to follow. Also, some phrases like "the poison of selfish despair did its work upon the heart of Kuei Ping" are a bit archaic but not incorrect. I didn't spot any major grammatical errors, but the dense, poetic language in places might affect fluency slightly. So Fluency might be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect and the overall logical flow. The segment follows Kuei Ping's emotional journey, her decision to leave, her prayer, and her return with a changed perspective. The narrative moves from her struggles at home to her solitary reflection and back. The structure seems logical, but there are transitions between scenes (like from preparing to leave to the sunrise scene) that might feel a bit abrupt. Also, the inclusion of the poem-like sections ("Wherein...") might disrupt the flow for some readers. However, the overall progression is clear, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but mostly coherent.

Wait, but in the Coherence issues, maybe the abrupt transitions between Kuei Ping's preparations, her departure, the sunrise, and her return could be a problem. The poem sections are set apart but might feel like interruptions. Also, the shift from her desire to leave to finding peace might need smoother transitions. However, the text does connect her emotional state before and after, so it's generally coherent. Maybe a 4 for Coherence with some minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, poetic sentences (e.g., sunrise description) may slow reading flow.  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic phrasing (e.g., "pierced through and beyond the walls") feels slightly formal but not erroneous.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Kuei Ping’s internal struggles, departure preparations, and symbolic sunrise scene.  
- [STRUCTURE] Poetic interludes ("Wherein...") disrupt narrative continuity slightly.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  

Your assessment of the text:  
The text exhibits strong fluency overall, with minor syntactic complexity and archaic tone. Coherence is maintained through Kuei Ping’s character arc, though transitions between introspective and descriptive passages could be smoother.
