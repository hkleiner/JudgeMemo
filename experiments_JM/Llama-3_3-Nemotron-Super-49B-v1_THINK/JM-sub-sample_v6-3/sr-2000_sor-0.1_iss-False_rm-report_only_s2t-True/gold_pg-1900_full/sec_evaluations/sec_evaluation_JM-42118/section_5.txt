Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence on a Likert scale with half-points.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text seems mostly well-written. Let me scan through for any issues. The sentences are generally long but structured. There's some complex vocabulary like "remonstrances", "vulgar singers", "grim irony", but that's appropriate for the topic and doesn't hinder understanding. Are there any grammatical errors? I don't see obvious ones. Maybe some commas could be placed differently, but nothing that disrupts flow. The phrasing is mostly natural. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 4.5. Wait, the example given for 5 is "highly fluent with minimal issues". If there are minor, non-distracting issues, 4.5 could be right. But I need to check again. The text uses phrases like "the massy foliage and the majestic trees that spring into the swinging heavens"—a bit poetic, but not awkward. Maybe some slight awkwardness in sentence structure here and there, but overall very fluent. So Fluency score 4.5.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect, logical flow, transitions. The current segment starts talking about Choiseul's remonstrances, then moves to the king's infatuation affecting France, then discusses Fragonard's work for Du Barry, then shifts to Fragonard's marriage and its impact on his art. Are these sections well-connected? The first part discusses Du Barry's influence and Fragonard's rejected paintings. Then it transitions to Fragonard's personal life and artistic change. The transition from Du Barry's rejection to Fragonard's marriage might feel a bit abrupt. The paragraph about the Du Barry's bills and then moving to the Gérard family in Grasse could be smoother. Also, the part about Fragonard's style influenced by Dutch artists seems to come in without a strong link to the previous paragraph about his marriage. However, each paragraph largely connects within itself. The overall narrative jumps between Fragonard's professional setbacks and personal life, which might cause some minor disruption but doesn't severely impact coherence. So Coherence might be a 4, as there are a few weak connections but the flow is mostly maintained.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, poetic sentence structures (e.g., "the massy foliage and the majestic trees that spring into the swinging heavens") may slightly slow readability.  
- [LEXICON] Rare archaic/vivid terms ("light-o'-love," "massy foliage") could marginally distract modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Du Barry’s rejection of Fragonard’s work to his marriage and artistic evolution (e.g., "The fact was that the Du Barry was of the gutter..." to "There lived in Grasse...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential details (e.g., Du Barry’s bills, Dutch influence) feel loosely integrated into the narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
