Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task properly. The user wants me to assess the "Current Segment" based on Fluency and Coherence, using the given criteria. The previous section is provided for context but shouldn't influence my scoring.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text provided seems mostly well-written, but I need to look for any errors or awkward phrasing. Scanning through the current segment, I notice a few things. For example, the sentence structure is generally complex but clear. However, there are some long, convoluted sentences that might disrupt flow. Like the part about Choiseul and the Jesuits—it's a bit dense. Also, some phrases might be a bit archaic or wordy, like "meantime" or "the light one" referring to Guimard. Are there any grammatical errors? I don't see obvious ones, but maybe some punctuation issues? Not really. Maybe some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, but overall, it's mostly fluent with minor issues. So Fluency score might be a 4.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow of ideas, connections between sections, clarity, etc. The current segment jumps between Fragonard's career, historical events with Choiseul and the Jesuits, the Pompadour's death, and then introduces Madame du Barry. These sections might feel a bit disconnected. For instance, the transition from Fragonard's work with Guimard to the historical political events feels abrupt. The narrative switches between art history and political intrigue without clear transitions. Each part on its own is understandable, but the links between them are weak. Also, some paragraphs introduce new characters (like Madame du Barry) without much setup, assuming prior knowledge. However, the overall structure within each subsection is logical. So Coherence issues would include abrupt transitions and lack of clear connections between different storylines. Score here might be a 3.5 because while it's generally followable, the shifts are noticeable.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures (e.g., "Meantime, Choiseul’s masterly mind...") may interrupt smooth readability.  
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal phrasing (e.g., "the light one," "reborn under a forged birth-certificate").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Fragonard’s artistic career, historical/political events (e.g., Jesuit abolition, Madame du Barry’s introduction), and biographical asides.  
- [STRUCTURE] Subsections (e.g., Pompadour’s death, Guimard’s conflict) feel loosely connected to the broader narrative arc.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
