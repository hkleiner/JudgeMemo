Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The user mentioned that the previous section should be ignored, so I'll concentrate only on the current text.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense and philosophical. I notice that the sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, sentences like "For Spencer, as for M. Bergson, we live in a world of change. But neither is content to accept changes as facts to be linked up within a scheme of scientific interpretation." are structured well but very long. There's also some repetition of concepts, like the constant reference to Spencer and Bergson's ideas without much transition. However, the grammar and syntax seem mostly correct. I didn't spot any spelling errors. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate, but the complexity might make it hard for some readers to follow. So for Fluency, the main issues are the overly complex sentence structures and some awkward phrasing due to length and density. Maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly fluent but has minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text discusses Spencer and Bergson's philosophies, comparing their concepts. The structure seems logical, moving from one point to the next, but there are abrupt shifts, like when it introduces Bergson's doctrine about the intellect portioning the world. The transition there feels a bit sudden. Also, the text assumes the reader is familiar with both philosophers' works, which might cause confusion. The quotes from Bergson and Spencer are integrated but could disrupt the flow for someone not familiar with the context. There's a clear progression, but some parts feel disconnected. For example, the part about Bertrand Russell and Mach feels like a tangent. So Coherence issues include abrupt topic shifts and lack of clear transitions between ideas. The score might be 3.5 because it's generally coherent but has noticeable disruptions.

Wait, let me check again. The text does have a logical flow overall, discussing the distinction between evolved and evolution, then critiquing Spencer's method, and comparing with Bergson. The problem areas are mainly the sudden introductions of new concepts without smooth transitions. Also, the paragraph about Russell and Mach seems a bit out of place. But the main points are connected. Maybe Coherence is a 4? Hmm. The criteria for 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The issues here are a few abrupt shifts and some tangents, but overall it holds together. So maybe 4 for Coherence.

Fluency: The complex sentences and some awkward phrasing due to length. But no major errors. So 4.

Coherence: A few weak transitions and assumptions of background knowledge, but overall logical. So 4.

Wait, but the user's scale for Coherence 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts." That fits. So FINAL Coherence Score: 4.

Fluency: "mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues." The minor issues here are the long sentences and some awkwardness. So Fluency 4.

But wait, the assistant's initial thought was 4 for Fluency and 3.5 for Coherence. Need to reconcile. Let me re-examine.

In the current segment, the writing is formal, with correct grammar and spelling. The main fluency issue is the complexity of sentences leading to slight awkwardness, but no errors. So Fluency should be 4.

For Coherence, the main issues are the abrupt introduction of Bergson's doctrine without clear transition, and the part about Russell feels like a side comment. However, the overall structure follows a logical comparison between the two philosophers. So maybe Coherence is 4, but the abrupt shifts might push it to 3.5. Since the user allows half-points, 3.5 might be better because there are noticeable coherence issues affecting the flow.

Yes, I think Coherence is 3.5. The text has some clear connections but also some jarring transitions and assumptions that disrupt coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures impair readability. - [LEXICON] Formal vocabulary may challenge comprehension for non-specialists.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts (e.g., introduction of Bergsonâ€™s doctrine, Russell/Mach tangent) disrupt flow. - [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of philosophical contexts without elaboration.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
