Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense and filled with complex philosophical concepts. The sentences are long and intricate, which might affect readability. I notice some repetitive phrasing, like the use of "as I understand the words" or "if the facts seem indubitably to point to its existence." These could be minor issues but might make the text a bit cumbersome. However, the grammar and syntax seem mostly correct. There's a quote at the end which is properly integrated, so no issues there. The main problem here might be the complexity leading to awkward phrasing in some parts, but overall, it's well-structured. Maybe a score of 4 for Fluency because while it's mostly fluent, the complexity and some repetitive phrases cause minor disruptions.

Now, Coherence. The text discusses Spencer's ideas and critiques them, then moves into explaining the author's viewpoint on cognitive processes and their relation to physiology. The structure seems logical, transitioning from critique to explanation. However, there are abrupt shifts, like when discussing gravitative knowledge versus cognitive knowledge. The part about the earth knowing the solar system feels a bit out of context without more setup. Also, the transition to quoting Spencer at the end might feel sudden, breaking the flow. The ideas are mostly connected, but some jumps in topics (like the effectiveness of cognitive relatedness) might confuse readers. So, Coherence might score a 3.5 because while the overall structure is there, there are noticeable shifts and some sections that aren't perfectly connected.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary and sentence structures may hinder smooth readability. - [REPEAT] Minor repetitive phrasing (e.g., explanatory asides).  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from criticizing Spencer to discussing gravitative vs. cognitive knowledge. - [STRUCTURE] Quotation at end feels disconnected from preceding philosophical analysis.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
