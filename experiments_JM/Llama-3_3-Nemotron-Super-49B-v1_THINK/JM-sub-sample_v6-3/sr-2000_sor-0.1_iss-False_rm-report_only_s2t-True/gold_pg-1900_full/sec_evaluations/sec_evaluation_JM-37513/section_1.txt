Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read the text carefully and note any issues in each category.

Starting with fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might make it a bit challenging, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue unless it causes confusion. Let me check for grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The sentences are quite long and complex, which could affect readability. For example, the sentence starting "With sparkling eyes I quoted these brave words..." is long but structured correctly. However, the use of semicolons and complex structures might make it a bit hard to follow for some readers. I didn't spot any outright grammatical errors, but the vocabulary is quite formal and old-fashioned (e.g., "animalcular", "quasi-biological"), which might require some effort to understand. So maybe a minor issue with lexicon due to antiquated terms, but not severe enough to drop the score too much. Since there are no major errors but some complexity, fluency score might be around 4.

Now coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas connect and the overall structure. The text seems to follow a narrative: the author's introduction to Spencer's philosophy, quoting Tyndall, then discussing Spencer's essay, explaining his concepts, and then evaluating his contributions. The transitions between these sections seem logical. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like moving from discussing the essay to citing experts (Darwin, James) without a clear transition. Also, the paragraph about Spencer's narrowness of intent feels a bit tacked on. The text assumes some background knowledge of Spencer and his works, which might confuse readers without that context. But since the task says to evaluate the segment on its own, even if some context is missing, maybe that's not a big issue here. The main ideas are mostly connected, but there are some jumps. So coherence issues might include structure and transitions. The score here could be around 3.5 because while it's generally coherent, there are noticeable disconnects.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may impede readability for modern readers.  
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., lengthy embedded clauses).  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between critiques of Spencer’s narrowness and expert endorsements.  
   - [CLARITY] Assumes familiarity with Spencer’s works and historical context without explicit explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
