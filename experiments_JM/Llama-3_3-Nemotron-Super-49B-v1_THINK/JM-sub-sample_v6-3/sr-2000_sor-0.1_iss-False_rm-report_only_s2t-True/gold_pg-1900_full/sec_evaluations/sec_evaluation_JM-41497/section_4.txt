Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older style, probably 19th or early 20th century, given the writing tone and references. The language is formal and somewhat archaic. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and phrasing issues. 

Reading through the segment, the sentences are complex and long, which might affect readability but isn't necessarily a fluency issue unless there are errors. I notice phrases like "nearly all who knew him loved him" which is clear. There's a mention of "the mental calibre of corporations is constant and not subject to change" â€“ that's a bit sarcastic but phrased correctly. 

Looking for errors: The text uses "it's" correctly as a contraction where needed. Punctuation seems proper with commas and periods. The structure of sentences varies, which helps flow. However, some sentences are quite long, like the one describing Reynolds' visit to the Low Countries. While long, they're structured correctly without grammatical mistakes. Maybe a minor issue with phrasing in places, but overall, it's well-written. The fluency score might be high, maybe 4.5, as it's mostly fluent with minor, negligible issues.

Now, Coherence. The segment starts by referencing the President (Reynolds) and transitions through various events in his life chronologically (1769 knighthood, 1773 mayor, 1780 exhibition move, etc.). Each paragraph connects to the timeline of his life and career. There's a smooth transition from discussing his social status to his artwork, honors, and interactions with other artists. 

However, there are some abrupt mentions, like the comparison to David Garrick's stage style, which feels a bit out of context but is explained briefly. Also, the jump from discussing Reynolds' health issue in 1782 to the next year's events is handled with "In 1783..." which is clear. The text assumes some prior knowledge (e.g., who Gainsborough is), but since it's part of a larger document, that's acceptable. The only potential coherence issue is the dense packing of multiple events without strong transitional phrases between some paragraphs, but overall, the logical progression is maintained. Coherence score might be 4, as mostly coherent with a few minor disconnects.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Fortune could have given him nothing more..."), but no grammatical errors.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor jumps between biographical events and art critiques (e.g., Garrick reference feels slightly tangential).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
