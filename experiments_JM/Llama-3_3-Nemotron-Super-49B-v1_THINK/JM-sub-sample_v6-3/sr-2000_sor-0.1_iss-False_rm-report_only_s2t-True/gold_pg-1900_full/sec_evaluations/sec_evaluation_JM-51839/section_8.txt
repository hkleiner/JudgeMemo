Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The user mentioned not to consider the Previous Section, so I'll ignore that. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the Current Segment carefully. The text seems to be historical, detailing various locations and events related to Nacogdoches. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The sentences are mostly clear. For example, "The house was built about 1830 and was provided with port-holes for shooting Indians in case of attack." That's straightforward. Then there's "Pendleton Ferry was the original ferry on the King’s Highway across the Sabine river; now spanned by a splendid interstate bridge." The semicolon usage here is correct. 

Looking at the Masonic Lodge section: "Some time in the Spring of 1837, immediately following the organization of a permanent government in Nacogdoches county, a movement for the organization of a Masonic lodge began which culminated in a dispensation from the Grand Lodge of Louisiana for the Milam Lodge No. 40, which was dated July 29, 1837." This sentence is a bit long but grammatically correct. Maybe a minor issue with wordiness, but not a major flaw. 

Further down: "One of them was retained by the Lodge and now occupies a prominent place in the East, there to remain for all time to come, never to be used again except it be by the President of the United States, the governor of Texas, or the Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas." The phrase "except it be" is a bit archaic but correct in formal writing. No obvious errors here. 

In the Texas' Monument section: "A glimpse of Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College, the Thomas J. Rusk building on the right." This could be seen as a slight clarity issue because it's a bit abrupt, but it's a descriptive phrase. 

Old Nacogdoches University Building part: "The project of rebuilding the exterior... is now partially completed." Clear. Then, "We feel that now is the time to emulate the spirit of the pioneers. Let us be awakened to this opportunity..." The transition here from descriptive to exhortative might feel a bit sudden, but it's a common structure in historical texts moving to a call for action.

For Fluency, the main issues might be some long sentences and a couple of transitions, but overall, the text is well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. Maybe a score of 4 because while mostly fluent, there are minor structural issues in sentence length and a few transitions.

Now Coherence. The section jumps between different topics: the house, Pendleton Ferry, McMahan’s Chapel, then into the Masonic Lodge history, followed by Texas' Monument, and finally the University Building project. Each paragraph seems self-contained but the connections between them aren't clearly stated. For example, after discussing the lodge, it shifts to Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College without a clear link. Then to the University Building with a call to action. The coherence issue here is the lack of transitions between these distinct historical points. Each part is coherent on its own, but the overall flow between topics is abrupt. 

So for Coherence, the main problem is the abrupt shifts between sections without clear connections. That would likely score a 3 because while each part is understandable, the overall structure lacks smooth transitions, making the text somewhat disjointed.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Some lengthy sentences with complex structures (e.g., "culminated in a dispensation..."), minor wordiness.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from Masonic Lodge to university building) without transitional links.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
