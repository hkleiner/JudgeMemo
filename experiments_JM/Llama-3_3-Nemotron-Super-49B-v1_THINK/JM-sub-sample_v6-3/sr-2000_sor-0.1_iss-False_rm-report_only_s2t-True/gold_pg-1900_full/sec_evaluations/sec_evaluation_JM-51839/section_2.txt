Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The user mentioned that the previous section should be ignored, so I'll concentrate solely on the text under "Current Section to Evaluate."

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking through the text, I notice that the sentences are generally well-structured. There are some long sentences, like the one about Gil Ybarbo's titles and the part about the investigation leading to his removal. Those might make the flow a bit choppy, but they're still understandable. I didn't spot any major grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary seems appropriate, and the transitions between sentences are smooth. Maybe a minor issue with sentence length affecting fluency slightly, but overall, it's clear and fluent. So Fluency score might be a 4 or 4.5.

Now, Coherence. This is about how the ideas connect logically. The section starts talking about the eastern boundary of Texas, then moves into Gil Ybarbo's actions, the growth of the city, the investigation against him, and then jumps to Philip Nolan's expedition. Each paragraph seems to follow a timeline, but there might be a slight disconnect between the initial discussion of the boundary and the shift to Ybarbo's activities. However, each event is chronologically ordered. The transition to Nolan's expedition is introduced as happening in 1800, which follows the previous timeline (1792 investigation). Then it moves to the Mexican Revolution and Dr. Long's expedition. Each chapter heading helps structure the narrative, but without the headings, the jumps between different historical events might feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from Ybarbo's removal to Nolan's expedition might not have a clear transitional sentence, but the time frames (1792 to 1800) provide some connection. The text assumes some background knowledge, like knowing who Burr and Wilkinson are, but that's common in historical texts. Overall, the coherence is good, with minor transitions issues. Maybe a score of 4.

Wait, let me check again. The text has clear sections with time markers (1764, 1779, 1792, 1800, etc.), which helps coherence. Each event builds on the previous in a historical timeline. The only potential issue is the lack of explicit links between some paragraphs, but the chronological order holds it together. So Coherence might be a 4.5, but since there are minor abruptness without transitional phrases, maybe 4.

For Fluency, the main issue is the length of some sentences causing slight difficulty, but no errors. So 4.5? Or 4 if the sentence structure is considered mostly fluent despite length.

Finalizing: Fluency 4.5 (mostly fluent, minor sentence length issues), Coherence 4 (mostly coherent with minor transitional gaps).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally lengthy sentences may slightly impede smooth reading flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Minor abruptness between historical events (e.g., shift from Ybarbo’s removal to Nolan’s expedition) without explicit transitional links.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
