Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. I'll read through the current segment carefully. The text seems well-structured with long sentences, but are there any grammar errors? Let me check for subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, punctuation. For example, in the sentence "It was easier to fence in the prairies than to clear the forest lands of East Texas. Many of the citizens of Nacogdoches, including some of the more prominent persons, removed to other places." The structure here is correct. Another part: "After the annexation of Texas to the United States, Nacogdoches gradually settled down to the station of one of the many flourishing towns of the State, and lost the preeminence..." "Station of" might sound a bit awkward; maybe "became one of" would be smoother, but it's not a major error. 

Looking for any awkward phrasing. The transition between paragraphs seems logical, but some sentences are quite long and complex. For instance, the paragraph starting "When the shadow of war..." has multiple clauses but flows okay. Are there any missing articles or incorrect prepositions? Not that I notice. Spelling seems correct. Maybe some word choices could be better, like "proportions of an insignificant village" is a bit formal but acceptable. 

Now, Coherence. This is about the overall logical flow and connection of ideas. The segment starts talking about fencing vs. clearing land, then moves to the town's decline post-annexation, then discusses social aspects, the impact of war, recovery with the railroad, growth into a city, and ends with a historical summary of the flags. Each paragraph seems to follow a timeline, but are there abrupt jumps? The transition from social life to the war section might feel a bit sudden, but it's part of a historical narrative. The part about the University of Nacogdoches in 1845 connects to the education aspect. The final paragraph about the flags ties back to the chapter title, which is okay. However, the shift from the town's development to the detailed history of the Old Stone Fort in the next chapter might not be fully connected, but since the current segment ends before that, maybe it's okay. Wait, the current segment includes up to "...Stars and Stripes forever." and then starts a new chapter. But the user said to evaluate only the current segment. So the last part before "CHAPTER: Historical Sites..." is part of the current segment. The closing sentence "Nacogdoches had now become one of the fairest of the little cities of Texas and bids a hearty welcome to all comers within her borders." followed by the list of flags might feel a bit disconnected. The flags list is a summary of the town's history, which is a coherent conclusion. 

For Coherence issues: The transition from the war's impact to the railroad arrival is smooth as a turning point. The introduction of the railroad brings new development, which is logical. The mention of the University and schools connects to the social center aspect. The final flags section is a historical recap, which might feel like a list but serves to conclude the story under nine flags. Maybe the coherence is generally good, but the flags part is somewhat abrupt as a conclusion without a clear link to the preceding paragraph about the city's growth. However, given the chapter's context, it's acceptable. 

So for Fluency, the main issues might be some slightly awkward phrasing (like "station of") and complex sentence structures, but no major errors. Hence, Fluency score around 4 or 4.5. 

For Coherence, the structure is mostly logical, with each paragraph building on the timeline. The only potential issue is the conclusion with the flags feeling a bit tacked on, but it's thematic. So Coherence score maybe 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede smooth flow. - [LEXICON] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "station of").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Slight abruptness in concluding with the "nine flags" summary without explicit transitional link.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
