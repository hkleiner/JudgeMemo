Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems mostly well-written, but I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through, the sentences are long but structured. There are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "the conditions which had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed away" – that's a bit wordy. Also, "the studious boy must have been impressed" could be phrased more smoothly. Another point: "the great mass of vapour overhead whirled before the violence of the storm" – maybe "whirled in the face of" would be better. No obvious spelling errors, but some sentence structures are complex and might disrupt flow slightly. So Fluency is good but not perfect. Maybe a 4?

For Coherence, the text transitions between Millet's birth context, his family, early life, and then the chapter on migration to Paris. The flow seems logical, each part connecting to his development. However, the transition from the detailed family background to "CHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS" feels a bit abrupt. There's a heading, but the paragraph before doesn't lead into it smoothly. Also, the last paragraph before the chapter heading talks about his drawing and family support, then suddenly the chapter starts discussing his early life in a more general sense. That's a slight coherence issue. Otherwise, ideas are well-connected. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, but the abrupt chapter start is a minor flaw.

Wait, the Coherence scale says 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The abrupt transition is a weak part, but overall it's still coherent. So Coherence score 4. Fluency also 4 because the issues are minor but present.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "the conditions which had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed away").  
- [PHRASING] Minor awkwardness in word choice (e.g., "whirled before the violence of the storm").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to "CHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS" without clear narrative bridge.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
