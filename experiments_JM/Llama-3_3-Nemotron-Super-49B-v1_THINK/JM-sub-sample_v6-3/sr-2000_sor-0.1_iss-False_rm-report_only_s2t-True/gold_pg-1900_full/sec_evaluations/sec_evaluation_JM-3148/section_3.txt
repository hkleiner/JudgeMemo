Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a narrative with some quoted text and poems. Scanning through, the language seems formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability for modern readers, but that's style, not an error. Checking for grammatical issues: I notice phrases like "the village disapprobation of his favourite fiddle" – "disapprobation" is a less common word, but correct. There's a quote from "The Practical Violinist" which has somewhat archaic language but no obvious errors. The poems by Emerson and others are properly integrated with quotes. 

Wait, are there any actual grammar or spelling mistakes? The text uses "whom" correctly in "the boy whom the village disapprobation..." Wait, no, the actual sentence is "the village disapprobation of his favourite fiddle" – "disapprobation" is a noun, so that's correct. Maybe some long sentences, but they seem structured properly. For example, the sentence starting "It was in this year, also, that he made a very precious discovery..." is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

So Fluency might be high. Maybe a 5, but let me check again. Are there any awkward phrasings? The part where Anthony lays the wood away for twenty years and prays – the sentence structure there is a bit dramatic but intentional. No errors spotted. So Fluency score is likely 5.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The current segment starts with the boy reading the book, then quotes from it, transitions into a poem, discusses his development, finding the wood, his vow, and then a scene with the teacher and mother. The structure seems to follow his growth and focus on violin making. Each part connects to his passion and skills. The quotes and poems illustrate his inspiration. The shift from the technical aspects (wood preparation) to the emotional (prayer) and then to the teacher's visit might seem a bit abrupt, but transitions are managed with phrases like "And as if the year were not full enough of glory..." which links the events of the year. 

However, there's a part where it jumps from discussing the wood to the school-teacher sending a book. The transition here could be smoother. The sentence "That summer’s teaching had been the freak of a college student..." might be a bit unclear without context, but since we're evaluating the segment alone, it's somewhat explained that the teacher had an experience and sent a book. The conversation between the teacher and Widow Croft explains Tony's exceptional knowledge. The final question about the lad's words seems to summarize his depth, tying back to his character. 

So the main issue in Coherence might be a slight abruptness between some sections, but overall it's well-connected. Maybe a score of 4 because there are a few weak transitions but they don't disrupt much. 

Wait, the Coherence scale says a 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts." The transition from the wood discovery to the teacher might be one such part. But the rest flows logically. So Coherence score 4.

Finalizing: Fluency 5, Coherence 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may slightly impede modern readability (e.g., "disapprobation," "freak of a college student").  
   - [SYNTAX] One sentence ("It was in this year...") is lengthy but structurally sound.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Mild abruptness between the wood discovery and the schoolteacher’s gift (lacks explicit connector).  
   - [STRUCTURE] Poetic excerpts, while thematic, slightly disrupt narrative continuity.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
