Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text seems well-written overall. Scanning through, I notice a few complex sentences, but they're structured correctly. For example, "Taking up such an attitude in front of four men..." is a bit long but grammatically sound. There's a sentence like "the marvel was increased by the sight--to our notions so revolting--of the innumerable vermin..." which uses a parenthetical remark correctly. I don't see any obvious grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is formal but appropriate. Maybe some sentences are a bit dense, but they don't hinder understanding. So Fluency might be a high score, maybe 4.5 or 5. Wait, are there any minor issues? The transition between paragraphs seems okay. Maybe the shift from the murder scene to the canonization process is smooth. I think Fluency is strong here, so probably a 5.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole text flows logically. The section starts with Becket's defiance, then the murder, followed by his immediate canonization, the monks' reaction, the value of relics, the King's penance, and finally the start of pilgrimages. Each part connects to the next. The narrative moves from the event to its aftermath and consequences. There's a clear progression. However, there's a part where it mentions Dean Stanley adding a fact about vermin, which might feel like an aside, but it's contextual. Also, the jump from the monks' reaction to the King's penance two years later might need a clearer transition, but it's manageable. The structure is mostly logical, so Coherence is likely a 5 as well. Wait, are there any abrupt shifts? The section about the neighboring monastery wanting a relic seems to follow naturally from the discussion of relics. The King's penance connects back to the murder's impact. I think Coherence holds up without major issues, so score 5.

Wait, let me check again. For Fluency, any syntax issues? The sentence "the fear of sacrilege induced the knights to try to drag..." is a bit wordy but correct. The use of commas and semicolons seems appropriate. No errors spotted. For Coherence, the only possible minor point is the insertion of Dean Stanley's comment, but it's presented as an addition to the narrative, not disruptive. So both metrics score 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "the marvel was increased...") but structurally correct and clear.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Mild abruptness in shifting between historical events (e.g., murder → canonization → King’s penance), but logical flow is maintained.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **5**
