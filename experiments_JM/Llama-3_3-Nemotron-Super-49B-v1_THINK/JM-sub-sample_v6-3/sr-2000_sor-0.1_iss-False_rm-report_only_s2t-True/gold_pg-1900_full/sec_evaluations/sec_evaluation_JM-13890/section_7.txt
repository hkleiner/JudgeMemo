Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite descriptive and detailed, typical of architectural or historical writing. I notice that the sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the sentence about Stephen Langton's tomb is very long and has multiple clauses. That could be a syntax issue. Also, there are some word choices that might be less common, like "reticulated stonework" or "foliated capitals," but since it's a specialized topic, maybe that's acceptable. I didn't spot any grammatical errors, but the structure of some sentences is a bit convoluted. So Fluency might be a 4 because while it's mostly smooth, the complexity of sentences and some vocabulary could make it slightly less fluent for general readers.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between different parts of the cathedral: the arch, the western screen, various monuments, the north-west transept, etc. Each paragraph seems to focus on a different area, but there's a logical flow as the author is guiding the reader through the cathedral. However, there are abrupt transitions, like moving from discussing Archbishop Howley's opposition to the Reform Bill to then talking about the eastern parts of the Cathedral without a clear link. Also, the part about Stephen Langton's tomb and the contrast with Archbishop Howley feels a bit disconnected from the surrounding architectural descriptions. The text assumes a lot of prior knowledge (e.g., Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, specific historical figures) which might confuse some readers. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the overall structure follows a tour, there are some disconnects and assumptions of background knowledge.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses).  
- [LEXICON] Specialized vocabulary (e.g., "reticulated stonework," "foliated capitals") may impede readability for non-experts.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical anecdotes (e.g., Archbishop Howley) and architectural descriptions.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with figures like Stephen Langton or Chaucerâ€™s works without context.  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential jumps between spatial locations (e.g., north-west transept to Trinity Chapel).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
