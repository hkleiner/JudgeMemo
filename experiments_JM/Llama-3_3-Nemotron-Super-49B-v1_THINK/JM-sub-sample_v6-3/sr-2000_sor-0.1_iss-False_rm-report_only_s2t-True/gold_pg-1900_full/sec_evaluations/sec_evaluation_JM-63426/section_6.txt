Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text is quite lengthy, so I'll scan through for any errors or awkward phrasing. The writing style seems formal and old-fashioned, which might be intentional given the historical context (Gay Nineties, mentions of specific authors and printers). 

Looking for grammatical errors: The sentences are mostly complex but structured correctly. For example, "Having tried to run before even learning to creep" is a bit wordy but grammatically correct. There's a sentence like "I had tried to run before even learning to creep." That's a bit awkward in wording but not a grammar error. Maybe a comma splice or two, but not sure. The use of semicolons and commas seems appropriate. 

Spelling: I didn't notice any typos. The names (Strathmore, Caslon, etc.) are correctly used. 

Syntax and phrasing: Some sentences are long and convoluted. For instance, the part about the bicycle catalog and the flatware pattern has a lot packed into one sentence. It's clear but could be broken up for better flow. However, the author's style might prioritize descriptive detail over concise sentences. 

Lexicon: The vocabulary is rich with terms like "deckle edge papers," "cylinder press," which are specific to printing. This might make the text less accessible but isn't an error. 

So for Fluency, despite some lengthy sentences and slightly formal language, there are no major errors. Maybe minor issues with sentence structure affecting flow slightly. So Fluency score might be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The section starts with the decision to take the commission, then discusses the success leading to expansion, followed by overwhelmed state, closing the press, and then shifts to a new chapter in New York. The transition from the Wayside Press failure to the Interlude in New York might feel a bit abrupt. The chapter title "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" helps, but within the current segment, the switch from business failure to the descriptive scene in NYC could be smoother. 

Within the New York part, the narrative follows the protagonist meeting Richard Harding Davis. The flow here is logical, each part leading to the next. However, the abrupt jump from the business collapse to the new scene might disrupt coherence. Also, the use of "And now we are in the Gay Nineties..." could be a clearer transition. 

The story elements are logically sequenced otherwise. The only issue is the transition between the two main parts of the current segment. So Coherence would be a 4, mostly coherent with a few weak transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally lengthy, complex sentences (e.g., "Caslon types on Strathmore papers having proved so popular...") may impede smooth flow.  
   - [LEXICON] Specialized printing terminology (e.g., "cylinder press," "deckle edge papers") could reduce accessibility for non-expert readers.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from business collapse ("had to go away for a complete rest") to the "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" scene without clear narrative bridge.  
   - [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in tone and setting (e.g., "And now we are in the Gay Nineties...") feels disconnected from preceding paragraphs.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
