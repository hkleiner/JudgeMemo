Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria. 

First, I need to read through the current segment carefully. The text is a narrative about the author's journey into teaching and contrasts two young men's approaches to their roles. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Scanning the text, I notice that the sentences are generally well-structured. There are some long sentences, but they seem to flow okay. For example, the part where the author visits the school with the president of the board has detailed descriptions, but each sentence connects logically. I don't see any obvious grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary is appropriate, maybe a bit formal, but that's expected for the time period it was written (seems old, given the 1916 reference). So Fluency might be high, maybe a 5. But wait, are there any awkward phrasings? The transition between the two young men's stories is clear, and the narrative progresses logically. I think Fluency is strong here, so score 5.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole text hangs together logically. The chapter starts with the author's entry into teaching, then tells two contrasting stories about school administrators. The first part explains the author's reluctant entry into teaching, then introduces two examples to illustrate different approaches. The narrative flows from the author's experience to the examples, and then concludes with a moral about treating teaching as a job vs. a profession. The structure is clear: introduction, two anecdotes, conclusion. Transitions between sections are smooth. However, the shift from the author's story to the two young men might feel a bit abrupt, but it's introduced as an illustration, so it's justified. Each part connects to the theme of professionalism in teaching. I don't see disjointed ideas or major logical gaps. So Coherence is also high, probably a 5. But wait, the second chapter "Getting a Position" starts abruptly after the first story. Wait, noâ€”the current segment includes both chapters? Wait, looking back: the current segment to evaluate includes "ENTERING THE TEACHING PROFESSION" and then "GETTING A POSITION". Wait, the user instruction says the current segment is what's provided. So the text includes two chapters. Need to check coherence across both. 

Wait, the first chapter talks about the author becoming a teacher and then two examples. The second chapter, "GETTING A POSITION", discusses how young people enter education without considering their fit and the importance of personality. Is there a coherence issue between the two chapters? The first part is about the author's experience and two administrative examples, the second part shifts to advice on hiring and teacher qualities. The transition between the chapters might be a bit sudden, but each chapter has its own coherence. However, since the evaluation is on the current segment as a whole, including both chapters, the overall coherence might have a slight drop because the topics, while related to teaching, shift from personal experience and administrative examples to hiring practices. But the author connects them through the theme of professionalism and effective teaching practices. The second chapter's content follows logically as a separate point but related to the profession. So maybe the coherence is still high, but perhaps a 4.5 because the transition between chapters could be smoother, but within each chapter, the coherence is strong. Alternatively, since each chapter is self-contained and the overall theme holds, maybe it's still a 5. Hmm. 

Wait, the Coherence scale says a 5 is highly coherent with clear progression. If the two chapters are distinct but related, and the text doesn't have abrupt jumps within each chapter, then maybe it's still a 5. The issue might be that the second chapter starts without a clear connector, but given that it's a new chapter, perhaps that's acceptable. The user instruction says to evaluate the section on its own, considering it might be part of a larger document. So the coherence within the provided segment: each chapter has its own structure, and the ideas within each are well-connected. So maybe Coherence is 5. 

But let me check again. In the first chapter, after the author's story, the two examples are clearly introduced as illustrating the situation. Then the second chapter discusses a different aspect (hiring and teacher traits) but still under the broader topic of entering/experiencing the teaching profession. The connection between the chapters might not be explicitly stated, but they contribute to the overall theme. So overall coherence is maintained. Hence, Coherence score 5.

Wait, but the user's previous section is empty, so this is the start. The text has two chapters here. If the evaluation is on the entire current segment (both chapters), then the coherence across them needs assessment. The first chapter sets up the author's entry and contrasts two approaches. The second chapter discusses the importance of matching teachers to appropriate positions and the role of personality. The link between the two is the theme of effective teaching/professionalsim. The transition could be smoother, but since they are separate chapters, it's acceptable. So Coherence remains 5.

Therefore, Fluency 5, Coherence 5. But wait, let me check for any minor issues. In Fluency, are there any awkward sentences? For example, "I must not accept just a mere job, and to escape that humiliation I became a teacher." The structure here is a bit complex, but it's clear. Maybe a minor issue, but not enough to deduct from a 5. The text is mostly fluent. 

For Coherence, within each chapter, the logic holds. The second young man's story about adjusting desk distances to solve the teacher problem is well-integrated. The conclusion "One man had made school teaching a job; the other had made it a profession" ties it back. The second chapter's discussion on personality and preparation also flows well. So yes, both scores are 5.
