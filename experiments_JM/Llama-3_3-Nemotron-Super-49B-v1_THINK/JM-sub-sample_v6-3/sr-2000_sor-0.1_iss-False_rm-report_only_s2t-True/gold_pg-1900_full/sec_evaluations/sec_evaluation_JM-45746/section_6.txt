Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The user mentioned not to consider the context, so I'll ignore the previous section.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems well-structured, with proper grammar and spelling. I didn't notice any major errors. The sentences flow smoothly, and the language is clear. Maybe some slightly long sentences, but they don't hinder understanding. So Fluency is likely a high score, maybe 5. But wait, are there any minor issues? Like "coöperation" with the diaeresis—might be a typo, but it's used consistently. Not a big deal. So Fluency score is 5.

Now Coherence. The section starts with the janitor's interaction, then moves to the principal's meeting, and discusses teacher feedback. The transition from the janitor story to the principals' meeting might feel a bit abrupt. The narrative shifts from a personal anecdote to a discussion based on survey data. There's a clear structure in the discussion points (I, II, III), but the jump between the story and the meeting topic could be smoother. However, the content within each part is logical. So the main issue is the transition between the anecdote and the meeting section. Coherence score might be 4 because the overall flow is good except for that one transition.
