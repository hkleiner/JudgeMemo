Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given scales.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The current segment is a narrative written in a somewhat formal, possibly early 20th-century style. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues.

Reading through the text, I notice that the sentences are generally well-structured. The author uses descriptive language effectively, like "Large, torpid, viscous flies" and vivid imagery such as the hotel resembling something resurrected from the dead. There's a good mix of short and long sentences, which aids in flow. However, there are a few places where the phrasing might feel a bit archaic or slightly awkward to modern readers, like "I had a vision of these flies rising in a dark cloud from the battlefields of Verdun..." but that's stylistic rather than an error. 

I also check for grammatical mistakes. For example, "Turpentine I felt would avail not in this hotel" seems a bit odd in word order, but it's more of a stylistic choice for emphasis rather than a mistake. The use of semicolons and commas appears correct. Spelling seems okay, assuming "déjeûner" and "carnet rouge" are intentional French terms. 

So for Fluency, the main issues might be minor stylistic choices that don't hinder understanding. Maybe a score of 4 or 4.5 because it's mostly fluent with only minor, non-distracting issues.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas are connected, logical sequence, transitions, etc. The narrative moves from the hotel experience, to trying to find transportation, visiting headquarters, the hospitals, and then the station incident. Each part transitions reasonably, though there are some jumps. For example, after visiting the hospitals, the narrator suddenly talks about the town being silent and then the drive. The transitions here are smooth enough because each scene follows the narrator's actions in a logical timeline. 

However, there's a part where the author mentions "It is not my purpose to describe the hospitals here" which might feel a bit abrupt, breaking the flow slightly. Also, the shift from the hospital visit to the drive and then the station could be smoother, but it's manageable. The story stays focused on the narrator's experiences without major disconnects. 

So for Coherence, maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly coherent with a few minor transitions that could be better but don't disrupt the flow significantly.

Wait, but let me check again. The section starts in the dining room, then the office, then military headquarters, hospitals, back to the station. Each segment follows the narrator's journey, so the structure is logical. The only possible issue is the sentence about not describing the hospitals, which is a meta-comment that might slightly disrupt coherence, but it's a common literary device. 

Therefore, Fluency: 4.5 (very fluent, minor stylistic points but no errors), Coherence: 4 (mostly coherent, minor transitions).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing (e.g., "Turpentine I felt would avail not") may slightly disrupt modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Rarely awkward sentence structure (e.g., "You, too, suddenly become as callous as if inoculated").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from hospital description disclaimer to continuing narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness between scenic vignettes (e.g., hospital visit to silent town description).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
