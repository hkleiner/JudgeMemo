Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to rate the entire text's Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report. The user wants just the final scores in the specific format.

First, I'll start with Fluency. Looking through each section's Fluency scores: most sections have 4.5, a couple have 4.5 again, and sections 05 and 08 have 5.0. The issues mentioned are mostly about complex sentences, occasional awkward phrasing, some lexical choices (like archaic terms or informal tone in formal contexts), and punctuation issues in one section. But the scores are generally high. The highest score is 5.0 in two sections, and the lowest is 4.5 in most. The problems are minor and don't seem to disrupt readability much. So Fluency is mostly at the higher end. Since the majority are 4.5 and some 5, but there are consistent minor issues (complex sentences, some word choices), maybe the overall Fluency is 4.5? Because even though there are some flaws, they're described as not significantly impacting readability.

Now for Coherence. The scores vary more: section_02 has 5.0, others range from 3.5 to 4.5. Issues include abrupt transitions, disjointedness, assumed context, and topic shifts without clear connectors. Sections 03, 06, 07, and 08 have 3.5, indicating more noticeable problems. The problems like abrupt shifts, lack of transitions, and assumed knowledge are recurring. Even in higher scored sections (like 4.0 or 4.5), there are minor disconnects. So Coherence has more variability. The main issues are transitions and structure. Since several sections have 3.5, which is "generally coherent but noticeable issues," and others are 4.0 or 4.5, the average might be around 4.0. But considering the recurring transition problems across many sections, maybe it's a bit lower. Wait, section_02 is 5, but others have lower. Let me count: out of 10 sections, two have 3.5 (sections 03,06,07,08? Wait section_03 is 3.5, section_06 is 3.5, section_07 is 3.5, section_08 is 3.5. That's four sections with 3.5. Then sections 01,04,10 have 4.0; sections 05 and 09 have 4.5; section_02 has 5.0. So four sections at 3.5, three at 4.0, two at 4.5, one at 5.0. The average would be (4*3.5 + 3*4 + 2*4.5 +1*5)/10 = (14 +12 +9 +5)/10 = 40/10=4.0. But since the problems are recurring across many sections, even if the average is 4.0, the fact that half the sections have 3.5 or lower might bring it down. However, the criteria for 4.0 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," and 3.5 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." Since there are multiple sections with 3.5, which are considered noticeable, maybe the overall Coherence is 3.8 or 3.9, but since we can use half-points, maybe 3.5? Wait, no. Let me think again. The scale says 4.0 is mostly coherent with few weak parts. If several sections have 3.5 (which is generally coherent but with noticeable issues), then the overall might be between 3.5 and 4.0. But the report mentions that in many sections, there are abrupt transitions and lack of clear connections, which are significant for coherence. However, the highest scores in some sections balance it. Maybe the final Coherence score is 4.0 because while there are issues, the text is mostly coherent overall. But I need to check the criteria again. For Coherence score 4: "mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow." If the issues are present in multiple sections but not severely disrupting, maybe 4.0. But some sections have more serious issues (like abrupt shifts without transitions), which might be more than "a few." Alternatively, if the problems are frequent but not devastating, maybe 3.8, which would round to 3.5 or 4.0. Since the user allows half-points, perhaps 3.8 isn't an option, so 3.5 or 4.0. Given that half the sections have 3.5 or lower, but others are higher, maybe 3.8 is closer to 4.0. Hmm. Alternatively, considering that the majority of the issues are transitions and structure, which are key for coherence, even if the text is mostly okay, the recurring transition problems might lower the score. Maybe 3.8, but since we can't do 3.8, the closest half-point is 3.5 or 4.0. The criteria for 3.5 is "generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts..." which seems to fit the report's findings across several sections. So maybe Coherence is 3.5 overall.

Wait, but section_02 has a 5.0, and some others have 4.5. So maybe the average is around 4.0, but the problems are widespread enough to bring it down to 3.8, which would be 3.5 or 4.0. Since 3.5 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues," and the report has many sections with such issues, maybe 3.5 is appropriate. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. The Coherence issues are in almost every section, with transitions being a big problem. Even in higher-scoring sections, there are minor issues. So overall, while the text is coherent in parts, the frequent transition problems and disjointedness in several sections would make the overall Coherence score 3.5. Because the definition for 3.5 is "generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts," which matches the report. So Coherence: 3.5.

Fluency, despite some complex sentences and lexical issues, is mostly high, so 4.5.

So final scores: Fluency 4.5, Coherence 3.5.
