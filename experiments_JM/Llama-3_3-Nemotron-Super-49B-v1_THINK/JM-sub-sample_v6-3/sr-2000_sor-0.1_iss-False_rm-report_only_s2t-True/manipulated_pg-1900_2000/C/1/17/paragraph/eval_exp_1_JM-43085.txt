Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the overall Coherence and Fluency of the text based on the section-wise report. 

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a Fluency score of 5.0. The issues listed are about archaisms and complex sentence structures in section_01, and dense vocabulary plus one awkward transition in section_02. But since the scores are 5.0 for both, that means despite these minor issues, the fluency is mostly good. The problems are noted but don't distract much. According to the scale, a 5 is "highly fluent with minimal issues." The issues here are minor and don't impede readability significantly. So the overall Fluency should be 5.0.

Now Coherence. Section_01 has a 3.0, and section_02 has 3.5. The issues in section_01 include an abrupt introduction of Joshua Reynolds, disrupting flow. Section_02 has an abrupt shift to the French Revolution and lack of clear links. The Coherence scale says a 3 is "generally coherent but with noticeable issues," and 3.5 isn't exactly on the scale but suggests between 3 and 4. Since both sections have structural issues affecting flow, but not completely incoherent. The average might be around 3.25, but since we can use half-points, maybe 3.5? Wait, the overall coherence is impacted by both sections. Section_01's coherence is weaker (3.0) with a significant disruption, and section_02 is 3.5 with some shifts but maybe less severe. Combining these, the overall Coherence might be a 3.0 or 3.5. But looking at the criteria: a 3 is "generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts," which fits. A 3.5 isn't an official score, but since we can use half-points, maybe the average is 3.25, rounded to 3.5? Wait, the user allows half-points, so perhaps 3.5 is acceptable if the issues are significant but not overwhelming. However, the main problems are structural and affect the overall narrative flow. Since both sections have coherence issues, but not to the point of being largely incoherent, I think the overall Coherence score would be 3.0. Because the problems are recurring across sections, even if one part is 3.5 and the other 3.0, the average might lean towards 3.0. Alternatively, considering the more severe issue in section_01 (abrupt introduction) and the shifts in section_02, maybe 3.0 is more accurate. 

So final scores: Fluency 5.0, Coherence 3.0.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 5.0
