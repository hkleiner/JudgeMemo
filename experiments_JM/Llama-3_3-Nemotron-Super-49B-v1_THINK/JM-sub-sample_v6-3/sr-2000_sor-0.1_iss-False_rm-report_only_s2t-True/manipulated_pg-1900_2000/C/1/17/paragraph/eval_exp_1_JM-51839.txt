Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence for the entire text based on the section-wise reports. 

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a Fluency score of 4.0. The issues mentioned are complex sentence structures, archaic vocabulary, a spelling mistake ("Comandante"), and a syntax issue with a semicolon. The scale says a 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt readability." The problems here are minor but present in both sections. However, the archaic vocabulary might affect flow for some readers, but the report doesn't indicate frequent errors. So overall, Fluency is strong but not perfect. Maybe a 4.0 is right on.

Now Coherence. Both sections scored 3.0. Issues include abrupt insertions (like the Joshua Reynolds paragraph), weak transitions between events, unclear structure in transitions, lack of contextual grounding for figures, and unresolved ambiguities. The Coherence scale for 3 is "generally coherent but with noticeable issues affecting the reading experience." Since both sections have these problems, especially the abrupt transitions and lack of clarity in introductions, it's impacting the overall coherence. But it's not frequent enough to drop to a 2. So Coherence should be 3.0 as well.

Wait, but the report mentions several coherence issues in both sections. Are they recurring enough to lower the score? The criteria for 3 says "noticeable abrupt shifts... that affect the reading experience." Since both sections have these, maybe it's consistent. But the overall structure isn't completely broken, just some parts. So sticking with 3.0 for Coherence.

Final scores: Fluency 4.0, Coherence 3.0.
