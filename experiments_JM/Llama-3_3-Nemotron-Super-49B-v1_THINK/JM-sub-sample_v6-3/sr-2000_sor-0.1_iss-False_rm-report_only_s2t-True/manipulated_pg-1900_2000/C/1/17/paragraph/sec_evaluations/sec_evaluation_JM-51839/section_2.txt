Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess both Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully. The first thing I notice is the structure and sentence flow. The sentences are mostly well-constructed, but there are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother. Let me check for grammar, spelling, syntax issues. The word "Comandante" should be "Commandante"—that's a spelling error. Also, "several hundred souls" is a bit archaic but not an error, just stylistic. Another spot: "the result of the investigation was the removal of Ybarbo from his office; he was sent to Bexar while the investigation proceeded." The semicolon might not be the best choice here; a period could make it clearer. 

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between different events and figures. For instance, after discussing Ybarbo's ordinances, it shifts to the investigation and then to the town's population. The transition feels abrupt. There's also a part where it mentions "the new city grew apace" without clear connection to the previous paragraph. Another issue is the introduction of various characters like Nolan, Musquiz, and others without much context, which might confuse readers not familiar with the history. The paragraph about Philip Nolan's expedition seems to introduce new plot points quickly, like the involvement of Burr and Wilkinson, which might not be fully explained here. 

For Fluency score: Despite some minor issues like the spelling mistake and a couple of awkward transitions, the text is generally clear. Most sentences are well-structured. So maybe a 4? But wait, the spelling error is a clear deduction. Since it's one error but noticeable, maybe 4.5? Wait, the scale says 5 is highly fluent with minimal errors. If there's a spelling mistake and some minor phrasing issues, maybe 4 is more accurate because it's "mostly fluent with minor issues."

For Coherence: The text has several abrupt shifts. The story moves from founding the city to an investigation, then to population growth, then to Nolan's expedition. Each part is somewhat connected historically, but the transitions between paragraphs could be better. The introduction of multiple names and events without clear links might reduce coherence. So Coherence would be a 3 because there are noticeable issues affecting the flow, but the overall structure is still mostly understandable.

Wait, let me double-check. The coherence issues are in transitions and introduction of new elements without smooth connections. The text doesn't have major inconsistencies, but the flow is interrupted. So a 3 seems right. Fluency, despite the spelling error and some syntax choices, is mostly good, so 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Comandante" misspelled as "Comandante".
- [SYNTAX] Semicolon in "removal...proceeded" disrupts flow; period preferred.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Ybarbo’s ordinances to population growth.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical events (e.g., Ybarbo’s removal to Nolan’s expedition).
- [CLARITY] Introductions of figures (e.g., Nolan, Musquiz) lack contextual grounding.
- [LOGIC] Unresolved ambiguity in "great change...territorial dispute" without elaboration.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
