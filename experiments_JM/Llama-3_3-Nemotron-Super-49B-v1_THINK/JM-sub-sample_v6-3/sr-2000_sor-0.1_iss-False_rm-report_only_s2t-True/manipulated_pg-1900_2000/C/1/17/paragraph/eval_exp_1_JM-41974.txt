Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the given report. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at the sections, both section_01 and section_02 have Fluency scores of 5.0. The issues mentioned are mostly about style rather than errors. For section_01, there's a note about overly complex sentences, but they're grammatically correct. Section_02 mentions elaborate vocabulary, which is a choice, not an error. The Fluency scale says a 5 is highly fluent with minimal to no grammatical issues. Since both sections are 5 and the issues don't affect grammatical correctness, Fluency should be 5.0 overall.

Now for Coherence. Both sections have lower scores: 2.5 and 2.0. The issues are structural. Section_01 has abrupt, unrelated paragraphs disrupting continuity. Section_02 has an anachronistic reference and an abrupt shift without transition. The Coherence scale for 2 says frequent inconsistencies making it hard to follow. But the overall structure isn't completely incoherent. However, the problems are recurring across both sections. The highest issue in section_01 is 2.5, and section_02 is 2.0. Averaging might not be right; instead, considering the most impactful problems. Since both sections have significant coherence issues that disrupt the flow, but the text isn't completely incoherent. Maybe a 2.5? Because it's between 2 and 3. The problems are noticeable and affect the reading experience, but there's some coherence. So Coherence score 2.5.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: **5.0**
