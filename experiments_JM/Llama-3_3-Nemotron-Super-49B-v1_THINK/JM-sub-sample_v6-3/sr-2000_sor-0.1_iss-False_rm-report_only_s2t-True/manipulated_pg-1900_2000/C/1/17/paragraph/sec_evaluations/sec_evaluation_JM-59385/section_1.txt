Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, etc. The text seems mostly smooth. I notice some long sentences, like the one starting with "Following the swaying tapestried box-like chairs..." That might be a bit cumbersome, but not a major error. There's also a part where it says "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" – "passively quiet" feels a bit odd; maybe "sat quietly" would be better. Another spot: "the day outside is dark" – should it be "was dark" for past tense consistency? Wait, the sentence says "at those times of the day when the shadows are long there is no golden sunshine... But I have found... when the day outside is dark." The verb tenses here mix present and past. "Are" and "is" in present, but the narrative is in past. That's a possible grammar issue. Also, in "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions..." – this sentence seems out of place. It talks about family statistics in Russia, Ireland, etc., which doesn't connect to the rest of the scene. That's more a coherence issue, though.

For Coherence, the section needs to flow logically. The sudden shift to "No uncertainty surrounds the nature of the generating impulse." and the following paragraphs about Leicester Square and Reynolds seem completely unrelated to the story about Kuei Ping and the jewel market. That's a major coherence problem. The text jumps from the jewel negotiation to a completely different topic without transition. Also, the memory flashback about the mission school is abrupt. The sentence "With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically, Kuei Ping was back in memory..." introduces a memory, but then it cuts off with "This too had been an indulgence..." and then abruptly changes topic again. These abrupt shifts disrupt the coherence.

So for Fluency, the main issues are a few awkward phrasings and tense inconsistencies. For Coherence, the biggest problem is the unrelated paragraphs at the end that break the narrative flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Following the swaying tapestried box-like chairs...")  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("the day outside is dark" vs. past tense context)  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing ("passively quiet")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated paragraphs (e.g., "No uncertainty...", "Leicester Square...") disrupting narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unmarked shift from jewel scene to memory flashback without resolution  
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur about family statistics ("Families are restricted...")  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
