Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rate the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the given section-wise report. I need to follow the instructions carefully and only output the scores without explanations.

First, I'll look at Fluency. Both sections have Fluency scores of 3.0 and 3.5. The issues mentioned include spelling (anachronisms like e-ink wallpaper), lexicon (archaic terms), and syntax (complex sentences, awkward phrasing). These are recurring across both sections. The anachronistic terms are a problem in both sections, which affects fluency because they disrupt the historical context and might confuse readers. Archaic language could make the text harder to read for modern audiences. The syntax issues like complex structures and awkward phrasing would interrupt the flow. 

For Fluency, the scale says a 3 is "generally readable but with multiple issues interrupting flow." Since both sections have these problems, but section 02 is slightly better (3.5), maybe the overall is around 3.2 or 3.3. But since we can use half-points, maybe 3.0 or 3.5 average? Wait, 3.0 and 3.5 average to 3.25, which would round to 3.25, but the options are half-points. So 3.5 is the higher, but considering the recurring anachronisms and consistent syntax issues, maybe it's a 3.0 overall. Wait, but section 02 is better. Hmm. Let me think. The first section has more severe issues (spelling, lexicon, syntax), and the second has some but maybe less severe. So overall, maybe 3.0 for Fluency.

Now Coherence. Section 01 has 3.0, section 02 has 4.0. Issues in section 01 include abrupt transitions, unresolved threads, and logic issues from anachronisms. Section 02 has clarity issues from anachronisms causing temporal confusion. Coherence scale: 3 is noticeable abrupt shifts, 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The first section has more serious coherence problems (unresolved threads, abrupt transitions), while the second section's main issue is the anachronisms affecting clarity. Since section 02 is better, but the overall text has both sections. The average would be (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5. But considering the first section's problems are more about structure and unresolved threads, which are significant, maybe the overall Coherence is 3.5. Because the second section is coherent except for the anachronism clarity issue, but the first section's coherence issues are more fundamental. So maybe 3.5 is appropriate.

Wait, but the Coherence issues in section 01 are more severe (STRUCTURE and LOGIC), while section 02's issue is CLARITY due to anachronisms. So the first part has problems in how the story is structured, while the second part's problem is more about detail consistency. Since coherence is about the whole narrative flow, the first section's abrupt transitions and unresolved threads might weigh more. But the second section is coherent otherwise. So maybe the overall Coherence is between 3 and 4. Since 3.5 is the average, but considering the impact, maybe 3.5 is correct.

So final scores: Fluency 3.0, Coherence 3.5.
