Okay, let me tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully. The first thing I notice is that the sentences are generally well-structured and long, which is good for fluency. However, there are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, the sentence "A tablet lit up on the table." seems out of place and disrupts the flow. It's unclear what this refers to, maybe a typo or misplaced sentence. That's a syntax issue because it's abrupt and doesn't connect to the surrounding context. 

Also, there are some complex sentences with multiple clauses. While they are mostly clear, a few might cause a slight pause. For instance, "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome and to shake itself free from monasticism and the various forms of idolatrous worship which grew up in the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church;" is quite long and packed with ideas. That's more of a syntax or phrasing issue under fluency. 

I didn't spot any major grammar or spelling errors, except maybe "sultry" which might be a word choice issue (LEXICON), but it's not incorrect. So, the main fluency deductions are for the abrupt sentence and some overly complex phrasing.

Now, Coherence. The text discusses Ethelbert's influence, Augustine's arrival, the conversion to Christianity, and then shifts to the history of St. Martin's church. The transition between the Christianization part and the architectural discussion of St. Martin's might feel a bit abrupt. The text jumps from talking about Canterbury's religious significance over centuries to debating the church's origins without a clear connector. That's a STRUCTURE issue in coherence. 

Also, there's a sentence about England taking nine centuries to reject the Bishop of Rome, which seems like a tangent, though it's somewhat relevant. It might disrupt the smooth progression. LOGIC here because it's a bit of a detour. 

The argument about St. Martin's being Roman or Saxon is presented with different opinions, which is clear, but the conclusion ("regard St. Martin's as being in part a very early Saxon building") could be smoother. Maybe a TRANSITION issue there. 

So, for Coherence, the main issues are abrupt transitions and some tangents, but overall the text holds together. 

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent but with some notable issues. The misplaced sentence and complex structures would bring it down from a 5. Maybe a 4 because the errors are noticeable but don't severely disrupt reading. 

Coherence: The transitions between sections could be better, and there's a bit of meandering, but the overall narrative is logical. So a 4 as well, since the issues are present but don't significantly disrupt understanding.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Abrupt, disconnected sentence ("A tablet lit up on the table.") - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., lengthy clauses)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Christianization to St. Martin's church debate - [LOGIC] Tangential comment about Englandâ€™s 9-century shift from Papal authority  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
