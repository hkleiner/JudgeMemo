Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems well-written overall, but I need to check for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexicon issues. Scanning through, the sentences are mostly complex but structured. I notice a few potential issues. For example, "the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling" might be a bit awkward in phrasing. Also, "the drone’s camera swiveled silently" feels out of place in the historical context. Wait, the previous section was about the 19th century, and suddenly a drone appears? That's a big anachronism. That's definitely a fluency issue under LEXICON because it introduces a modern term disrupting the historical setting.

Another point: "Thousands of pedestrians were pouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream." The phrase "ceaseless stream" is a bit clichéd, but maybe that's just style. Not sure if that's a deduction. Also, "russet leather leggins" – should be "leggings"? Spelling mistake? Or maybe "leggins" is an old spelling. Need to verify. If it's a typo, that's a SPELLING issue.

Now, Coherence. The section starts talking about the rainy season, then jumps to the history of Manila, then to the bridge scene, and ends with a notice about teachers. The transition from the historical description to the bridge observation seems okay because it's setting the scene. However, the abrupt shift from the vivid description of the bridge to the notice about teachers might be a bit jarring. The notice part feels like a new topic introduced without much connection. That could be a STRUCTURE issue under Coherence.

Also, the drone mention is not only a fluency issue but might affect coherence if it's supposed to be part of the historical narrative, which it clearly isn't. But since the context is that the author is describing their experience, maybe the drone is a mistake or a typo (like "donkey's" instead of "drone's"?). If it's intentional, it's a huge coherence problem. Assuming it's an error, it's more a fluency issue.

For Fluency score: Mostly fluent, but with a few notable errors (drone, possibly leggins). So maybe a 4? Because the errors are minor but noticeable.

For Coherence: The main issue is the sudden introduction of the notice at the end. The rest flows logically from describing the environment to the bridge scene. The notice feels tacked on. So a Coherence score of 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but with a weak part.

Wait, but the drone part – if that's a typo, maybe it's a fluency issue. If it's a content error, it affects coherence. Since drones didn't exist then, it's a major inconsistency. So under Coherence, that's a LOGIC issue. But the user said to evaluate the current segment on its own. If the drone is part of the narrative, it's a historical inaccuracy, making the text incoherent in terms of logical consistency. So that's a big problem.

Revising: Fluency might have the drone as LEXICON and leggins as SPELLING. Coherence would have the drone as LOGIC and the notice as STRUCTURE.

So Fluency score: 4 (minor issues but some noticeable ones). Coherence score: 3.5 because of the drone inconsistency and the notice transition.

Wait, but the drone line is "The drone’s camera swiveled silently." That's a clear anachronism. In the historical context, that's a major error affecting coherence. So Coherence would take a hit. The rest of the coherence is good, but that one line is a big problem. So maybe Coherence score 3.5.

Alternatively, if the drone is a typo (like "donkey" or "horse"), but as written, it's incorrect. So yes, LOGIC issue under Coherence.

Finalizing:

Fluency Issues:
- LEXICON: Anachronistic term "drone" in historical context.
- SPELLING: "leggins" (possibly should be "leggings").

Fluency Score: 4 (mostly fluent with minor issues)

Coherence Issues:
- LOGIC: Introduction of "drone" disrupts historical coherence.
- STRUCTURE: Abrupt transition to the notice at the end.

Coherence Score: 3.5 (generally coherent but with notable disruptions)
