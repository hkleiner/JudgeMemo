  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "jew’s-harp," "catgut," "degraded") may hinder readability for modern readers.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, elaborate sentence structures (e.g., descriptions of Anthony’s violin craftsmanship).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt, unexplained shifts (e.g., "A contactless payment completed," "A smart bulb changed color") disrupt narrative continuity.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden transition from present dialogue to Anthony’s backstory lacks bridging.

Section section_02 (Chars 8031–11639):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "If any one had ever given him a task...") may slightly impede flow.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaisms ("congress" shoe, "duckling hatched from a hen’s egg") and poetic phrasing ("vital relation with life and law") may require interpretation.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from Anthony’s childhood antics to philosophical musings ("Who made me, and what am I?") without explicit bridging.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Segments (school punishment, curiosity, outdoor education) are thematically linked but lack smooth connectors (e.g., "As he grew older..." feels slightly disconnected).
