Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria. First, I need to read the text carefully. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older style, maybe early 20th century. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I notice some archaic language like "whenever any excavation has taken place" or "the transition period between Roman and Saxon Canterbury." The vocabulary is formal, with words like "pre-eminence," "invaders," "tesselated pavements." While there's no obvious grammatical errors, the structure is quite formal and dense. The punctuation seems correct, but the long sentences might make it a bit hard to follow. So for Fluency, even though it's well-written, the complexity and formality might deduct a point. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues with phrasing due to complexity.

Now Coherence. The text moves from discussing the historical context of Canterbury, starting with the Romans, then the Anglo-Saxons. The structure seems logical, each paragraph builds on the previous. However, there's a jump from the Roman period to the Anglo-Saxon invasions without much transition. The author mentions the gap between the Roman and Saxon settlements but doesn't smoothly connect the ideas. Also, terms like "the transition period" are used without explanation. The text assumes some historical knowledge, like knowing who Ethelbert is. So for Coherence, there are some abrupt shifts and lack of clear transitions between historical periods. Maybe a 3.5 because it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues in transitions and assumptions of prior knowledge.

Wait, let me check the criteria again. Coherence score 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable abrupt shifts." Score 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The text has some jumps, like from Romans abandoning to Saxons taking over without explaining the gap clearly. Also, the mention of Ethelbert without context might confuse readers. So maybe 3.5 is right. 

Fluency: The main issue is the complex sentence structure and archaic vocabulary, but no errors. So Fluency score 4, because it's mostly fluent but with minor issues from complexity.

Coherence: The main issues are lack of transitions between historical periods and some assumptions of knowledge. So Coherence score 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Overly formal, archaic vocabulary (e.g., "pre-eminence," "tesselated") and excessively complex sentence structures.  
   - [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "The Romans...") that impair readability.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Roman to Saxon period without clear bridging.  
   - [CLARITY] Assumes historical context (e.g., Ethelbertâ€™s reign) without explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
