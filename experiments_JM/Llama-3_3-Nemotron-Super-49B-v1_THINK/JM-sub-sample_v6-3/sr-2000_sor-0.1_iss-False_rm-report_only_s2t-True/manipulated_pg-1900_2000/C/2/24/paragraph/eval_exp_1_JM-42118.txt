Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report.

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have high scores: 4.0 and 4.5. The issues mentioned are archaic vocabulary, complex phrasing, and long sentences. But these are considered minor in section 01 since the fluency score is 4.0. In section 02, the fluency is even higher at 4.5, with similar syntax and lexicon issues but maybe less severe. The key is that despite these, the text is mostly fluent. The main problems are style choices rather than errors. So overall, Fluency should be around 4.0 or 4.5. Since both sections are high but with some consistent issues, maybe average to 4.25, but since we can use half-points, perhaps 4.0 is safer because the issues, though present, don't disrupt much.

Now Coherence. Section 01 has a 4.0, but section 02 drops to 3.5. The issues in section 01 are abrupt transitions and too much historical detail. Section 02 has abrupt introductions of figures and lack of smooth connections between art and politics. The coherence issues are more pronounced in section 02. So the average would be between 4 and 3.5, which is 3.75. But considering the problems in both sections, especially the more serious ones in section 02, maybe 3.5 is appropriate. The text has noticeable coherence problems but isn't totally incoherent.

So final scores: Fluency 4.0, Coherence 3.5.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
