Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the entire text's Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report provided. Each section has scores and issues listed. My job is to look at these, identify recurring or serious problems, summarize the impactful issues for each metric, and then assign a final score from 1 to 5 with half-points allowed.

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a Fluency score of 3.5. The issues under Fluency in both sections are about lexicon (anachronistic terms like touchscreen panel, smartwatch, 3D printer) and syntax (occasionally complex sentence structures in section 01). So, the main problems are inappropriate vocabulary disrupting the formal tone and some complex sentences. 

Looking at the Fluency scale: A score of 3.5 in each section suggests that while there are issues, the text is generally readable but with noticeable problems. The lexicon issues are about anachronisms, which aren't grammatical errors per se but affect the tone and consistency. However, Fluency primarily focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Anachronistic terms might fall under word choice, so they do impact Fluency. The syntax issue with complex sentences also directly affects Fluency. 

Since both sections have the same Fluency score and similar issues, the overall Fluency is likely around 3.5. But wait, the scale says 3.5 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues..." Here, the issues are more about word choice (anachronisms) and complex sentences. Are these considered grammatical/structural? Anachronisms might not be grammatical errors but affect fluency through inappropriate word choice. Complex sentences can make the text harder to follow. So maybe the overall Fluency is 3.5. But let me check if the problems are frequent enough. Each section has a few issues, but not overwhelming. So sticking with 3.5 for Fluency.

Now Coherence. Both sections scored 3.0. Issues include structure problems with abrupt references to modern tech, logic issues from anachronisms disrupting historical context, transitions (abrupt shift from poverty to Victorian progress), and clarity (assuming reader knowledge without explanation). 

Coherence scale: A 3.0 means "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments..." The problems here are more structural. The anachronisms not only affect Fluency but also Coherence by disrupting the historical context. The transition issue in section 02 and the lack of elaboration on historical references (clarity) contribute to coherence problems. Since both sections have similar Coherence scores and the issues are about structure, logic, transitions, and clarity, the overall Coherence is likely 3.0. However, I need to consider if these issues are frequent enough to lower the score. The report mentions "notable" problems but doesn't indicate they're pervasive. So maybe 3.0 is accurate.

Wait, but the user's task is to detect recurring or serious problems. Anachronisms appear in both sections, which is recurring. The historical context disruption is serious for Coherence. Similarly, the transition issue and assuming reader knowledge are also significant. So maybe Coherence deserves a slightly lower score? Let me check the scale again. Score 3 is for noticeable issues affecting the reading experience. Score 2 is for frequent inconsistencies. Here, the issues are present in both sections but not described as frequent. So 3.0 seems right.

Therefore, final scores: Fluency 3.5, Coherence 3.0.
