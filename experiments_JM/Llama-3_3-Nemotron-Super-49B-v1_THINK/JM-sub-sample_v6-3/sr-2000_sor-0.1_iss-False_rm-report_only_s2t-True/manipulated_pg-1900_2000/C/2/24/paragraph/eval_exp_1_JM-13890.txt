Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to evaluate both Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report provided. Let me start with Fluency.

Looking at the Fluency scores for both sections: both are 4.0. The issues mentioned are mostly about overly formal vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and some syntax problems like long sentences or disconnected ones. For example, in section_01, there are archaic words like "pre-eminence" and "tesselated", and convoluted sentences. Section_02 has an abrupt sentence like "A tablet lit up on the table" and lengthy clauses. 

The Fluency scale says a 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt readability much." Since both sections have these minor but noticeable issues, but overall the text is readable. There's no indication of frequent errors or severe problems that would drop it to a 3. So Fluency should stay at 4.0.

Now for Coherence. The scores are 3.5 and 4.0. Issues include abrupt shifts in topics (like from Roman to Saxon without transition), assuming historical context without explanation, an abrupt transition from Christianization to a church debate, and a tangential comment. 

Coherence scale: A 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," and 3 is "generally coherent but with noticeable issues." Section_01 has a 3.5, which might average with section_02's 4.0. The problems here are more significantâ€”abrupt shifts and lack of explanation for key points. These affect the flow more than the Fluency issues. However, the text isn't frequently inconsistent or illogical overall. So averaging the two sections, maybe a 3.75, but since we can use half-points, perhaps 3.5 or 4.0? Wait, the first section's 3.5 and the second's 4.0 average to 3.75, which would round to 4.0 if we round up, but the issues in section_01 are more impactful. The transition issues and assumptions without explanation are notable. So maybe the overall Coherence is 3.5 because the problems in section_01 are serious enough to bring the average down. 

Wait, but the task says to detect recurring or serious problems. The abrupt transitions and lack of clarity in explanations are in both sections. For example, section_01 assumes context, and section_02 has an abrupt transition and a tangential comment. These are recurring in terms of coherence issues. So even though one section is 4.0, the other's 3.5 with significant issues might make the overall Coherence a 3.5. Because the problems are not just minor but affect understanding, especially the historical context assumption which could confuse readers. 

So final scores: Fluency 4.0, Coherence 3.5.
