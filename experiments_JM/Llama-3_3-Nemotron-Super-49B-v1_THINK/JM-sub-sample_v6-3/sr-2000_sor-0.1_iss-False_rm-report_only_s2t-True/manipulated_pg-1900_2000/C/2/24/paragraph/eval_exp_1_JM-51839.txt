Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence based on the provided report. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at the Fluency scores for each section: section_01 has 4.0 and section_02 has 4.5. The issues mentioned are a syntax problem in section_01 with an abrupt technical phrase, and in section_02, a spelling error ("Comandante") and some long, complex sentences. The spelling mistake is minor, and the long sentences might affect flow but aren't catastrophic. The main issue in section_01 is that one phrase disrupts the narrative, but overall, the scores are high. Since both sections are mostly fluent with minor issues, the overall Fluency should be around 4. Maybe 4.0 or 4.25? But since the second section is 4.5 and the first 4.0, averaging might give 4.25. But the guidelines say to consider recurring or serious problems. The syntax issue in section_01 is serious but isolated. The spelling error is minor. So maybe 4.0 overall.

Now Coherence. Section_01 has 3.5 and section_02 has 3.0. Issues include abrupt shifts in historical events, non-chronological jumps, and anachronistic terms. These are more significant. Section_01 has transitions and structure issues, section_02 has structure and clarity issues with anachronisms. Coherence is about the whole text's logical flow. Both sections have problems that disrupt the narrative. The anachronistic terms are particularly bad because they disrupt historical coherence. So the issues are recurring across sections. The scores average to around 3.25, but considering the impact, maybe 3.0? Because the problems are noticeable and affect understanding. So Coherence might be 3.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.0**  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
