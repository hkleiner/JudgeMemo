Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few things. There's a sentence: "Your mother is troubled. Finally she says, “Perhaps it will be for the best.”" The transition here feels a bit abrupt. The mother's concern isn't fully explained, which might cause a slight pause. Also, the line "The laser display turned off automatically." seems out of place. Lasers weren't around in the early Eighties setting, so that's an anachronism. That's a LEXICON issue because it's a word choice problem. 

Another point is the structure of some sentences. For example, "You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press. Then you receive your first lesson in feeding." These are simple and a bit choppy. The use of "washing-up" might be non-standard terminology, possibly a SPELLING or LEXICON issue if it's incorrect in this context. Also, phrases like "the two jobbers are kicked" are unclear. "Kicked" here probably means fired, but it's abrupt and unclear without context, leading to a SYNTAX issue.

For Coherence, the text jumps between different time periods and events. The narrative moves from the protagonist's home situation to the job at Iron Ore, then to interactions with other printers and the move to a new building. While mostly logical, some transitions are abrupt. For example, the switch from working at Iron Ore to the description of The Peninsula Record and the job offer feels a bit disconnected. There's also the part about the faker selling soap, which introduces a new scene without a clear connection to the preceding narrative, causing a STRUCTURE issue.

The anachronistic "laser display" disrupts coherence because it doesn't fit the time period, causing a CLARITY problem. The text assumes the reader knows what a Gordon press is without explanation, which might confuse some readers, affecting LOGIC.

Scoring Fluency: There are several minor issues but the text is generally readable. The anachronism and some unclear terms are notable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are errors, they don't make it unreadable.

Coherence: The story has a clear progression overall, but some jumps and the anachronism cause issues. Maybe a 3? Because there are noticeable disruptions but the main narrative holds.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic term ("laser display") in early 1880s setting.  
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt, unclear phrases (e.g., "the two jobbers are kicked").  
- [SPELLING/LEXICON] Non-standard terminology ("washing-up a Gordon press").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene shifts (e.g., faker introduction lacks contextual bridge).  
- [CLARITY] Unexplained assumptions (e.g., "Gordon press" specifics).  
- [LOGIC] Temporal inconsistency with "laser display".  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
