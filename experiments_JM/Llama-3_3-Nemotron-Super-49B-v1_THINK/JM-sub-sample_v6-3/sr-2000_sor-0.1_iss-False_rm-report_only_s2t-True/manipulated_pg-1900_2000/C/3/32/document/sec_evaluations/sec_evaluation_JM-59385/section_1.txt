Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older style, maybe early 20th century. The language is formal and descriptive. I notice some long, complex sentences that might affect readability. For example, the sentence about Kuei Ping's memory jump has a lot of clauses. Are there any grammar errors? Let me check. The structure seems correct, but word choice might be a bit archaic, like "passively quiet" or "lend light." Also, some phrases like "the hour grew on" instead of "as time passed" might be less common today. Punctuation looks okay, but there are no contractions, making it a bit stilted. So Fluency might be a 4 because it's mostly smooth but has some minor issues from outdated phrasing and sentence length.

Now Coherence. The story follows Kuei Ping's visit to the jewel shop. The transitions between scenes seem okay, like moving from the street to the shop. However, there's a sudden shift to her memory of the mission school. The transition here feels abrupt without a clear connector. The memory isn't fully integrated into the current scene, disrupting the flow. Also, some parts might be repetitive, like the descriptions of the negotiations, but they contribute to the atmosphere. So Coherence might be a 4 as well because the main narrative is clear, but there's that one jarring transition.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "passively quiet," "lend light," "the hour grew on").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multi-clausal constructions).  
- [STYLE] Formal, non-contracted dialogue and narrative voice may feel stiff to modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to Kuei Pingâ€™s memory of the mission school without contextual bridge.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor repetition in detailing jewel negotiations, though atmospheric.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
