Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text. Starting with Fluency, which looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is from 1916, so some archaic language might be present, but I should check for actual errors.

Looking through the text, the sentences are mostly long and complex but structured well. I notice a few possible issues. For example, "the thing" is used repeatedly, which might be intentional as a colloquialism but could affect clarity. There's also "oeuvre" mentioned without explanation, which might confuse some readers. Are there any grammatical errors? The sentence "If you lose your permis de séjour you cannot leave Paris until the end of the war." seems correct. Another spot: "my native tongue" is used correctly. Wait, there's a part where "stuff" is written instead of "staff" or another term—maybe a typo? Like "President of the first division of the stuff". That could be a typo, affecting fluency. Also, "taubes" should probably be "taubes" (a type of plane), but maybe that's correct terminology for the time. 

For Coherence, the text jumps between talking about the bourgeoisie, attempting to get to the war zone, and then the visit to Meaux. The structure seems logical overall, with each paragraph leading to the next effort to get permission. However, there's a transition from discussing the difficulty with the embassy to meeting the duchess which might feel a bit abrupt. Also, the shift from the bureaucratic process to the description of Meaux's battlefield could be smoother. The author's tone remains consistent, but some parts might feel like tangents, like the comment about American embassies. 

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite some archaic terms and possible typos ("stuff" instead of "staff"), the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much, so maybe a 4. For Coherence, the narrative has a clear progression, though some transitions could be better. The main points connect, even if there are slight jumps. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, but need to check the scales again. Wait, the scales say 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts". The text has some abrupt shifts but overall holds together, so 4 for both?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms ("the thing" for unspecified entities) and unclear abbreviations (e.g., "oeuvre" without context).  
- [SPELLING/TYPO] Potential typo ("stuff" instead of "staff" or similar).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from bureaucratic navigation to descriptive battlefield scenes (e.g., Meaux graves).  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor tangents (e.g., critique of American embassies) slightly disrupt focus.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
