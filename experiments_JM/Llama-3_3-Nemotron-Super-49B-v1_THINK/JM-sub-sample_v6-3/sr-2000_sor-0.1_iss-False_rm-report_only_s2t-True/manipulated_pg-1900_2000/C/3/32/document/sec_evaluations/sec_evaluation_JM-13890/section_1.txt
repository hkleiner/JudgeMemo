Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. The user provided detailed scales for each, so I should refer to those.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking at the current segment, the text is mostly well-written. However, there are some repeated phrases like "a thing" which seems like a placeholder or typo. For example, "Thomas of a thing" should probably be "Thomas Becket." These errors might disrupt the flow slightly. Also, there are long, complex sentences that could make reading a bit difficult, but they're not overly confusing. So, the main issues here are the mysterious "a thing" repetitions and possibly some sentence structure, but overall it's readable. Maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly fluent but has noticeable minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect and the overall structure. The text jumps between historical events and the author's reflections on pilgrims. The transition from Chapter I to II might feel a bit abrupt since Chapter II dives into ancient history without a clear link explained in the given segment. Also, the author mentions "the thing" repeatedly without context, which could confuse readers about what "thing" refers to. However, within each chapter, the ideas are generally logical. The biggest issue is the unclear references and the abrupt shift in topics between chapters. So, coherence is mostly there but with some disconnects, maybe a score of 3.5 because while it's generally coherent, there are noticeable issues like unclear terms and transitions.

Wait, but the evaluation is only for the current segment, which includes both chapters. The transition between Chapter I and II in the provided text might be part of the coherence issue. The author moves from discussing pilgrims and the shrine's destruction to the history of Canterbury without a clear bridge. That could be a structure issue. Also, "a thing" is used multiple times without explanation, causing ambiguity. So for Coherence, the main problems are ambiguous references and abrupt topic shifts. 

For Fluency, the "a thing" errors are under LEXICON maybe, since it's a word choice issue. The long sentences could be SYNTAX. 

So finalizing:

Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Repeated undefined term "a thing" causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures.

Coherence Issues:
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "a thing").
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical and reflective sections.

Scores: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent with minor issues), Coherence 3.5 (generally coherent but with notable problems).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated undefined placeholder "a thing" (e.g., "Thomas of a thing," "the stuff Way")  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It might have been truly thought...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the thing" without context)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter I’s thematic reflection to Chapter II’s historical chronology  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
