Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the overall Fluency and Coherence scores based on the section-wise report. 

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a 4.5 score. The issues mentioned are archaic vocabulary, convoluted sentences, a typo ("stuff and Calcutta"), and awkward sentence structure in one part. The lexicon issues might make it a bit less smooth for modern readers, but the main syntax issues are occasional. Since both sections are high (4.5), the overall fluency is mostly good with minor issues. The highest score is 5, which requires minimal errors. Here, there are some noticeable issues but not frequent. So maybe a 4.5 overall? Wait, but the criteria for 4 is "mostly fluent, minor issues". Since both sections are 4.5, which is between 4 and 5. Maybe average them? But the user wants a single score. Since both are 4.5, the final should be 4.5.

Now Coherence. Section 1 is 3.5, section 2 is 4.0. Issues include abrupt topic shifts, repetitive undefined terms, abrupt shifts in structure, and sudden jumps. Section 1 has more severe issues like undefined terms and abrupt shifts. Section 2 has some shifts but maybe less severe. The overall coherence has noticeable problems. The scale for 3.5 is "generally coherent but with noticeable issues". Since one section is 3.5 and the other 4, averaging might give around 3.75, but since we can use half-points, maybe 4.0? Wait, the criteria for 4 is "mostly coherent, a few weak parts". But section 1 has more significant issues (repetitive undefined term, abrupt shifts), which are more than just a few weak parts. So maybe the overall is between 3.5 and 4.0. Considering both sections, perhaps 3.5 or 4.0. Since section 1's issues are more impactful (like the undefined term causing disruption), maybe the overall Coherence score is 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
