Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully. The first thing I notice is the structure. The text is mostly composed of short sentences, which can affect flow. For example, "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." is a standalone sentence that feels abrupt. There's also "Country newspaper shops train and use local help for straight matter." which shifts topics a bit without a clear transition. 

Looking for grammar or syntax issues. The sentence "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." uses "having" which might be a bit formal but not incorrect. However, "you learn the lay of a lower-case" might be a typo; should it be "layout"? That's a possible LEXICON issue. Also, "the stuff, across the street, is a four-page tabloid." The term "stuff" is informal and unclear without context. Maybe [LEXICON] again.

For Coherence, the main concern is how ideas connect. The section starts with Willie being sent home for arithmetic, then asking to work, getting a job, and progressing through responsibilities. The part about the faker selling soap at the end seems somewhat disconnected. The transition from Willie's job progression to the scene with the faker isn't smooth. There's a jump from describing the job to the evening scene without a clear link. That's a STRUCTURE or TRANSITION issue.

Also, some parts feel like info dumps, like the details about the print shop's location and the trial with Roosevelt. While they add context, they might disrupt the narrative flow. Maybe [CLARITY] because it's a bit too detailed without integrating smoothly.

Scoring Fluency: There are some minor issues with phrasing and a possible typo, but overall it's readable. Maybe a 4? But the short sentences and a few awkward phrasings might bring it down to 3.5.

Coherence: The main issue is the abrupt shift at the end and some disconnected elements. The story mostly flows but has noticeable jumps. So maybe a 3.5 as well, but need to check the scales. Coherence scale says 3 is generally coherent with noticeable issues. The faker part is a significant disconnect, so maybe 3.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Unclear/informal terminology (e.g., "the stuff")  
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure (e.g., "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway.")  
- [SPELLING/TYPO] "learn the lay of a lower-case" (likely "layout")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift to the "faker" scene without transitional context  
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed asides (e.g., Roosevelt trial, print shop layout) disrupt narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
