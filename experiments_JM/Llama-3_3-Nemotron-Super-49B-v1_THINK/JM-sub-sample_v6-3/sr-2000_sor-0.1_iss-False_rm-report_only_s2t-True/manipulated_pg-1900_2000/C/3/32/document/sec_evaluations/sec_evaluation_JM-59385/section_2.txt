Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately on a 1-5 scale with half-points. Let me start by reading through the current segment carefully to identify any issues.

For Fluency, I'm looking at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text seems mostly well-written, but there are a few spots that catch my eye. For example, "the tenseness of the principal’s voice" might be a bit awkward; maybe "tense" would be better. Also, "asking the stuff to come and sit" should probably be "asking them" instead of "stuff." Then there's "the marvel of the opportunity, then very still because she knew its impossibility." The transition here feels a bit abrupt. Another part: "the spirit of freedom that lit the eyes of the American girl" is poetic but maybe a tad wordy. Also, "a trifle curt" is correct, but the sentence structure around it might be slightly formal. Lastly, "the utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other" has a typo—"thing" should probably be "East." These are minor, though. Most sentences flow well, so Fluency is likely a 4 or 4.5. Maybe 4.5 because the errors are minimal and don't disrupt much.

Now for Coherence. The section seems to follow Kuei Ping's memories and conflict. However, there are some transitions that might be abrupt. For instance, moving from the memory of Miss Porter to the family's plans feels a bit disconnected without a clearer bridge. Also, the shift from the emotional conflict to Madame Yen taking the pearls might lack a smooth transition. The ideas are mostly logical, but some connections between paragraphs could be clearer. There's also a bit of repetition in emphasizing Kuei Ping's conflict, which might make it slightly less cohesive. Coherence score might be around 4, as the main narrative is clear but has some minor disconnects.

Wait, let me check again. The memory sequence is clear, but when it cuts back to the present with Madame Yen, the transition could be smoother. Also, the part about the engagement bracelets and silver medal being in separate parts of her life might feel a bit tacked on. However, the overall structure is logical. So maybe Coherence is a 4. 

Finalizing: Fluency 4.5 (minor issues, mostly fluent), Coherence 4 (mostly coherent with some minor transitions).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "asking the stuff to come" (should be "them")  
- [SPELLING] "thing" (likely "East") in "make a thing and West understand"  
- [LEXICON] "tenseness of the principal’s voice" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from memory to Madame Yen’s action without clear bridge  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on conflict without fully resolving connections  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
