Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is descriptive and uses complex sentences. I notice some long, winding sentences that might make reading a bit tough, like the one about the glovemaker looking out and his thoughts. There's also repetitive phrasing, such as "the thing" used multiple times without clear context—maybe a placeholder or typo? For example, "the thing-pieces" and "a thing-century" could be errors. Also, words like "stuff" seem out of place, possibly incorrect usage. Checking for grammar, I see "a boy-child, whom the priest... christened" which is a bit archaic but not incorrect. Punctuation looks mostly okay, but some commas might be missing or misplaced, affecting flow. Overall, the language is rich but has some awkwardness and possible typos.

Now, Coherence. The narrative jumps between describing Grasse, Fragonard's birth, historical events with the king and Pompadour, and then back to the boy's life. Transitions between these sections feel abrupt. For example, moving from the glovemaker's vows to the historical context without a clear link. The chapter split to "ROME" starts abruptly with "All this was but Paris-gossip..." which doesn't smoothly connect the previous part about the boy's situation. Also, some parts repeat ideas, like the influence of Parisian gossip in Grasse. The structure is mostly chronological but has disjointed sections.

For Fluency score: The text is generally readable but has notable issues—repetitive placeholders, some awkward phrasing, possible typos. So maybe a 3.5? It's not severely broken but has frequent minor issues.

For Coherence: The story has logical progression overall but with abrupt shifts and lack of clear transitions. Some sections feel disconnected. Score around 3.5 as well because while the main points connect, the execution has flaws.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent/inaccurate terminology (e.g., "the thing," "stuff")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, unwieldy sentence structures (e.g., "As the glovemaker looked out...")  
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repetitive descriptive phrases ("sunlit Grasse," "the thing")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter transition ("ROME") without contextual bridge  
- [TRANSITION] Disjointed shifts between biographical, historical, and descriptive passages  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the stuff," unresolved historical allusions)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*The text exhibits ornate, descriptive language but is marred by unclear placeholders ("the thing"), awkward sentence structures, and repetitive phrasing, affecting fluency. Coherence suffers from abrupt transitions, disjointed historical inserts, and unclear references, though the broad narrative arc remains followable.*
