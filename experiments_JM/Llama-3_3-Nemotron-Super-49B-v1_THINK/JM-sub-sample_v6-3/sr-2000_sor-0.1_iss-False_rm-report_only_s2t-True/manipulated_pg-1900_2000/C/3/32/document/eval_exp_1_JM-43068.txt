Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the provided section-wise report. 

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a Fluency score of 4.0. The issues mentioned are archaic vocabulary in section_01, which might make it less readable for modern readers. Also, overly complex sentence structures in both sections. But since the scores are 4.0, that means mostly fluent with minor issues. The archaic words are a style choice but could affect readability. However, the report doesn't indicate frequent errors, just some complexity. So overall, Fluency is strong but not perfect. Maybe a 4.0 overall since both sections are consistent.

Now Coherence. Section_01 has 3.5 and section_02 has 4.0. Issues in section_01 include abrupt transitions between topics (Brueghel, Millet, historical context), assuming prior knowledge, and a defensive tone that's tangential. In section_02, there's an abrupt transition after "La Baigneuse". The main problems are transitions and some assumptions. Section_01's coherence is a bit weaker. The overall coherence is generally there but with noticeable issues. Since one section is 3.5 and the other 4.0, averaging might give around 3.75, but since we can use half-points, maybe 3.5 or 4.0? Wait, the criteria for 4.0 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. Section_01 has more serious issues like abrupt transitions and tangential points, which affect the overall flow. So maybe the overall Coherence score is 3.5 because the problems in section_01 are more impactful even though section_02 is better. 

So final scores: Fluency 4.0, Coherence 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
