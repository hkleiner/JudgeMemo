  Fluency Issues:

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Extremely long, complex sentence structures (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?") require careful parsing.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Minor disconnect between Chapter I (Corvick’s departure) and Chapter II (visit to Bridges) without explicit contextual bridge in the excerpt.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed familiarity with characters’ relationships (e.g., Vereker’s reputation, Lady Jane’s role) and unresolved subplots (Gwendolen Erme’s situation) may confuse isolated readers.
