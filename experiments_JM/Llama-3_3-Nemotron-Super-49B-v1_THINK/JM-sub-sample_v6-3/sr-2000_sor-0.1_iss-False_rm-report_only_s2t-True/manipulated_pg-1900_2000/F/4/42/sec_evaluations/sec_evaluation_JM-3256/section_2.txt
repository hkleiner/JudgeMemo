Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately using the given scales.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability for modern readers, but the question is whether that's a fluency issue. The sentences are complex and long, but they seem structured correctly. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice "He woulded like to have" – that's a clear error ("would" instead of "would like" or "wanted"). Also, "the subject of the book does not entered" should be "does not enter". Those are grammar mistakes. The vocabulary is formal and uses words like "sinewy", "palate", "orthodox horror", which might make it less fluent for some, but the scale allows for some issues in a score of 4. The errors are minor but present, so Fluency might be a 4, considering it's mostly fluent but has a couple of noticeable errors.

Now Coherence. The text discusses the value of lasting literature versus popular works. It transitions through talking about Mark Rutherford, then quotes Sainte-Beuve, compares books to cathedrals and ships, and lists desired books. The ideas seem logically connected, each part building on the theme of enduring literature. However, the shift from the quote to the bookman's preferences (Milton, Masson's Life) might feel a bit abrupt. The structure is mostly clear, with each paragraph addressing a aspect of the main point. There's no major disjointedness, so Coherence is likely a 5, as the progression is logical and smooth despite some transitions that could be slightly smoother.

Wait, but the user mentioned "the subject of the book does not entered" – that's a grammar error affecting fluency. For coherence, the example about the bookman's books (Pilgrim's Progress, A’Kempis) supports the coherence by illustrating the point about timeless works. The only potential coherence issue is the transition to the specific book examples at the end, but it's still part of the overall theme. So Coherence stays at 5.

Finalizing: Fluency has two grammar errors but is otherwise fluent, so 4. Coherence is well-structured with a clear theme, so 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" instead of "would like" or "wanted"  
- [GRAMMAR] "does not entered" instead of "does not enter"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting to specific book examples (e.g., Milton, Masson’s Life)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
