Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence for the entire text based on the section-wise report.

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a Fluency score of 4.0. Looking at the issues, section 01 has subject-verb agreement errors, an archaic spelling ("dernier cri"), and some awkward sentence structures. Section 02 has incorrect verb forms like "coulded" and "mighted". The guidelines for Fluency score 4 mention "mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt readability." The errors here are noticeable but not frequent enough to drop to a 3. Since both sections are consistent at 4.0 and the issues are minor, the overall Fluency should stay at 4.0.

Now Coherence. Both sections scored 5.0, but section 01 has a mild abrupt transition and minor ambiguity resolved by dialogue. The Coherence scale for 5 requires a clear logical progression with minor lapses. Even though there are some minor issues, they're described as mild and resolved, so they don't significantly impact the overall coherence. Since both sections are 5 and the issues are minimal, the overall Coherence should remain 5.0.

Wait, but the first section's coherence had some abruptness and ambiguity. However, the report says they're mild and resolved. The criteria for 5 allows for barely noticeable lapses. Since the issues didn't prevent understanding and were minor, sticking with 5 makes sense. No sections had major coherence problems, so the final score for Coherence is 5.
