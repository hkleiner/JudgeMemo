Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The text seems mostly well-structured, but there are a few points. For example, "he did this half an hour later—I see it in his hand when he repaired to his room." The dash might be a stylistic choice, but in formal writing, a comma or em dash might be more conventional. Also, "at dinner I watched for the signs of this impression, tried to fancy some happier light in his eyes;"—the semicolon here feels a bit off; a period or comma might work better for flow. Another spot: "the party was large—there am people from outside as well" should be "there were people." That's a clear subject-verb agreement error. Also, "I was happy to be able to did the same" has a verb tense mistake ("did" instead of "do"). Lastly, "You’red so deep!" likely should be "You're so deep!" Missing apostrophe. 

Now for Coherence. The narrative follows a sequence of events: Lady Jane's interaction with the review, Vereker's reaction, and the dinner conversation. However, there are transitions that could be smoother. For instance, the shift from the author's reflection at dinner to Miss Poyle's question feels a bit abrupt. The dialogue drives the plot, but some connections between paragraphs might lack clear transitions. Also, the character motivations, like why Vereker dismisses the review, aren't fully explained here, which might cause slight confusion.

Scoring Fluency: Despite the errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt heavily. So maybe a 3.5? Wait, the subject-verb error and the "did" mistake are significant. But overall flow is maintained. Maybe 3.5 is right.

Coherence: The story progresses logically, but there are some jumps. The dialogue at dinner comes a bit out of nowhere, and the motivations could be clearer. So Coherence might be a 4, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak spots.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent punctuation (e.g., dashes instead of commas/em dashes in dialogue transitions).  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("there am people").  
- [SPELLING] Missing apostrophe in "You’red" (should be "You’re").  
- [SYNTAX] Incorrect verb tense ("did the same" instead of "do").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from author’s reflection to Miss Poyle’s question without clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] Underexplained character motivations (e.g., Vereker’s dismissal of the review).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
