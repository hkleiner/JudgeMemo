Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text segment. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a formal, somewhat archaic style, which might make it a bit dense, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice a few things. The sentence structure is complex with long sentences, which could affect readability. For example, the sentence starting "Whether it be in the development of the Earth..." is quite long and packed with ideas. There's also a possible error in "the ultimate mystery remains just as it was" – should it be "exactly as it was"? Wait, the original says "just as it was," which is grammatically correct, though a bit formal. Maybe "exactly" would be more common, but not a major error. Another point: "the modes of existence, dealt with in successive sections, were somewhat startlingly diverse!" The exclamation mark here feels out of place in an otherwise formal essay; maybe a period would be better. Also, "different from" vs "different than" – in "more different from each other" is correct. 

For Coherence, the text seems to follow a logical structure, discussing the introduction to Spencer's philosophy, quoting key passages, and analyzing the concepts. However, there are some transitions that could be smoother. For instance, the shift from discussing Spencer's essay to mentioning Darwin and James's opinions feels a bit abrupt. The paragraph about Spencer's narrowness of intent could be better connected to the preceding discussion. Also, the conclusion about his contributions to sociology and ethics feels a tad disconnected without clearer linking sentences.

So for Fluency, the main issues are complex sentence structures and a couple of stylistic choices (exclamation mark, formal language), but no major grammatical errors. That would likely score a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

For Coherence, the main problems are some abrupt transitions and a few segments that aren't fully integrated, but overall the text holds together logically. So maybe a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Whether it be...")  
- [LEXICON] Formal/archaic tone may hinder readability for modern audiences  
- [PUNCTUATION] Exclamation mark in formal context ("...diverse!")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Spencer’s essay to expert opinions (Darwin, James)  
- [STRUCTURE] Narrow thematic connections between paragraphs (e.g., sociology/ethics tangent)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
