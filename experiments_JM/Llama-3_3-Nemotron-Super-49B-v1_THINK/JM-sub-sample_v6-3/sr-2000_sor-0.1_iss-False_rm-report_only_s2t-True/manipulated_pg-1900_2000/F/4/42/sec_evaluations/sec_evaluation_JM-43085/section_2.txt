Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read both the context and the current segment carefully. The context is about Ernest (Meissonier) being sent to a druggist's apprenticeship but then pursuing art. The current segment continues his early art career, his struggles, and his first exhibition.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Scanning through the text, I notice a few issues. For example, "he himself had witnessed its close" might be a bit awkward phrasing. Also, "the reproduction of the Napoleonic Epic" could be clearer. There's "Meissonier very shortly quitted this somewhat dull discipline" – "very shortly" is a bit informal, maybe "soon" would be better. Then "he laboured greatly to the profit of his art" – "laboured" is correct but sounds a bit archaic. 

In "his father spare him an allowance" – should be "spared". That's a clear grammar error. "Be one's tastes never so modest" – maybe "However modest one's tastes may be". "there was many a day of sacrifice" – should be "were". "canvases that were generously paid for at five francs a meter!" – "per meter" is more common. "Unlooked-for windfall" is a bit formal but not an error. "he obtained an opportunity to decorate fans" – maybe "an opportunity arose" for smoother flow. "they could go to a restaurant twice a day, every day in the week" – redundant "every day". "I will not said" – should be "I will not say". "the public failed to distinguish a work which did not sufficiently distinguish itself" – a bit convoluted. "the first instalment of illustrations... was curtly rejected" – "instalment" is British, but acceptable. "deliberately made his way" is okay. "rendered distrustful by so youthful and importunate a face" – "so" might be better as "such". 

So for Fluency, the main issues are grammatical errors (e.g., "spare" instead of "spared", "was" instead of "were"), some awkward phrasing ("himself had witnessed"), and word choice ("laboured", "very shortly"). These are minor but noticeable. The text is mostly fluent, so maybe a 4? But let's check Coherence too.

For Coherence, the structure seems logical, following Meissonier's early career steps. However, there are abrupt transitions. For example, moving from his time with Cogniet to suddenly talking about his living conditions feels a bit disconnected. The part about decorating fans and religious figures comes out of nowhere without a clear link. Also, the sentence "But while waiting to achieve his dream, he had to achieve a living." is a bit abrupt as a transition. The paragraph about exhibiting at 16 and the response feels a bit separate from the preceding struggles. The shift to editors being the first to notice him also lacks a smooth transition. 

So Coherence issues include abrupt transitions between paragraphs and ideas, and some segments feeling disconnected. However, the overall narrative flows, so maybe a 4 as well? Wait, the criteria for Coherence 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts". The issues here are more than a few, maybe. Let me think. The transitions between his studio time, financial struggles, friends, and then the exhibition and publishers – each part is clear, but the connections between them could be smoother. So maybe a 3.5 for Coherence? Because the problems affect the reading experience but don't disrupt entirely.

Finalizing: Fluency has some errors but is mostly fluent (score 4), Coherence has noticeable transitions issues but generally holds (score 3.5).
