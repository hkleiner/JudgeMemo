Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria. 

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexicon issues. The first thing I notice is "he woulded have counted labour or study all joy." The verb here should be "would have," so "woulded" is incorrect. That's a grammar mistake. Another spot is "If any one have ever given him a task..." which should be "If anyone had ever given him..."â€”subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. Also, "Tony have more useless information" should be "had." These are clear grammar errors. 

For Coherence, the text seems mostly logical, but there are transitions between paragraphs that might feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from Anthony's childhood antics to his older self being lazy, then to his philosophical questions, and then to his education in the woods. Each part connects to his curiosity, but the shifts might not be the smoothest. Also, the sentence structure varies a lot, with some very long, poetic sentences and shorter ones, which could affect coherence. However, the overall narrative thread about Tony's curiosity and self-education is clear.

Fluency score: There are a few grammatical errors but the text is generally readable. Maybe a 4 because the errors are noticeable but don't disrupt too much.

Coherence score: The ideas are connected but transitions could be better. Some shifts in topic without clear links. Maybe a 4 as well because it's mostly coherent but has some weaknesses.
