Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the Fluency and Coherence of the given text, using the specified criteria. First, I need to read through the current segment carefully, ignoring the previous context since it's not provided here.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat formal, old-fashioned style, which might affect readability. I notice a few grammatical errors. For example, "which had been in use for years" should probably be "that had been in use for years" ( incorrect use of 'which'). There's also "he was preparing boxes and equipment to offer a course in agriculture"—maybe "boxes" isn't the right word; perhaps "materials" or "supplies"? Also, "the desks should faced" should be "should face". Another error: "it shoulded be cultivated" instead of "should be". These are minor but noticeable. The sentence structure is mostly clear, but some sentences are long and a bit convoluted, like the one describing the young man's agricultural plans. Despite these, the text is generally readable. So Fluency score might be around 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text has two main stories: the visit to the disorganized school and the visit to the well-managed one. The author contrasts the two, leading to the conclusion that one treated teaching as a job, the other as a profession. The transition between these anecdotes is smooth, and each supports the theme. However, the shift from the anecdotes to the discussion about getting a position feels a bit abrupt. The chapter "GETTING A POSITION" starts talking about teacher failures without a clear link to the previous stories. Also, the part about the principal's personality feels somewhat tangential, though it does illustrate the importance of personality. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since the main points connect but there are some weaker transitions and tangents.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense ("shoulded"), subject-verb agreement ("desks should faced"), and pronoun usage ("which" instead of "that"). - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("force to stop over", "give much time") and awkward word choices ("boxes" for equipment). - [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It was quite evident...").
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from anecdotes to "GETTING A POSITION" without clear linking. - [STRUCTURE] Tangential example about the principal’s personality (relevant but loosely integrated). - [LOGIC] Minor repetition in contrasting "job" vs. "profession" without explicit thematic connection to preceding advice.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
