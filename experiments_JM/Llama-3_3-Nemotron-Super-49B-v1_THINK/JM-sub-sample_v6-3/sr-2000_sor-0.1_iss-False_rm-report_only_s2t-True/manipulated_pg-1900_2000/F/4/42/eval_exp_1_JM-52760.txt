Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence for the entire text based on the two section reports. 

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a 4.0 score. The issues listed are grammatical errors like "soon to was" instead of "soon to become", "follow by" instead of "followed by", "Grant arrive" missing a verb tense. In the second section, there's a subject-verb agreement error ("have" instead of "has") and tense inconsistency ("work continue" should be "continued"). Also, some complex sentence structures were noted. 

The Fluency scale says a 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt readability." The errors here are minor but present in both sections. They are noticeable but don't make the text hard to understand. So overall, the fluency is strong but not perfect. Since both sections are 4.0 and the issues are scattered but not frequent, I think the final Fluency score should stay at 4.0.

Now Coherence. Both sections also scored 4.0. The issues include abrupt transitions (like moving from military actions to Petersburgâ€™s description without a link), an unegrated battle list, abrupt transition to the BATTLE OF PETERSBURG chapter, and lack of connection between Dimmock Line vulnerabilities and the battle. 

Coherence scale for 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts not significantly disrupting flow." The problems here are structural and transitional. However, they are described as "abrupt" and "disrupting narrative flow," but the overall structure is still logical. Since these are a few instances and the rest connects well, the final Coherence score should also be 4.0. 

I don't see any severe or recurring issues that would drop either score below 4. The problems are present but don't overwhelm the text's overall quality in either aspect.
