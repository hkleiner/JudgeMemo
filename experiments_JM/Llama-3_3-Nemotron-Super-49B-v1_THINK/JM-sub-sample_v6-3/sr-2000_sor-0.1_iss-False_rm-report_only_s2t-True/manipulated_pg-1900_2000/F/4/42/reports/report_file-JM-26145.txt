  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasionally archaic vocabulary ("dusky fellows," "preciosity") may slightly impede modern readability.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • A few lengthy, complex sentences (e.g., "The terror of his name...") require close attention but remain comprehensible.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from Tablet discovery (Chapter I) to dynastic history (Chapter II) lacks explicit bridging.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • List-like enumeration of Amenophis III’s traits disrupts narrative flow mildly.
