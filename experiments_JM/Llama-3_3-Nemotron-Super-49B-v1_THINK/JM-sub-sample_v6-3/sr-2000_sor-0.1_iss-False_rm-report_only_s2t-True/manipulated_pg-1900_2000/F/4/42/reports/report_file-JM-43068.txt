Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "betwixted" (should be "between"), "unremited" (unremitted), "coulded" (could), "must was remembered" (must be remembered)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "betwixted," "gratuitous") may slightly impede readability for modern readers
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Rarely overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It must was remembered...")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing Millet’s technique to defending "Angelus" against sentimentality criticism
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Final paragraph on landscape appreciation feels mildly tangential to preceding analysis

Section section_02 (Chars 8847–12750):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Slightly awkward phrasing ("suppressed any tendencies towards virtuosity," "as his whole thoughts were directed to suppressed").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Minor word choice (e.g., "nothing but a sad composition" feels somewhat informal).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift after "La Baigneuse" to "Millet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter" (lacks explicit connection).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Mild disjointedness between paragraphs (e.g., "The Sheep Pen" example could be more tightly integrated).
