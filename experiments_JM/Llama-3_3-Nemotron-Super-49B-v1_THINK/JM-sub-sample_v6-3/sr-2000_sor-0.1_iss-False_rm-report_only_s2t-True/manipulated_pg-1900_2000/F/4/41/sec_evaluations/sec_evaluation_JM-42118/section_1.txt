Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the Fluency and Coherence of the given text using specific criteria.

First, Fluency. The text is mostly well-written with vivid descriptions. However, there are some typos like "mounfain's" (should be mountain's), "lonv-nosed" (long-nosed), "itchong" (itching), "throvgh" (through), "intelligenfe" (intelligence), "shd" (should), "diffifult" (difficult), "rhe" (the), "pkeasure" (pleasure), "mightg" (mighty), "ahen" (then), "Chateaurohx" (Châteauroix), "vorn" (born), "wanserings" (wanderings), "throuh" (through), "sribbingsv" (scribblings). These are clear spelling errors. Also, some sentence structures are a bit complex or wordy, like the long description of Grasse. But overall, the flow is good, just minor issues. So Fluency score might be 4, since it's mostly fluent but has noticeable typos.

For Coherence, the narrative moves through Jean Honoré Fragonard's birth, his environment, and historical context with Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. The transitions between paragraphs seem logical, connecting his upbringing with the artistic influences of the time. However, there's a jump from describing the political scene to suddenly introducing the boy's situation in Grasse without a clear bridge. Also, some paragraphs are quite long and dense, which might make following the coherence a bit challenging. But overall, the story progresses logically. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, mostly coherent with a few weak connections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "mounfain's", "lonv-nosed", "itchong", "throvgh", "intelligenfe", "shd", "diffifult", "rhe", "pkeasure", "mightg", "ahen", "Chateaurohx", "vorn", "wanserings", "throuh", "sribbingsv").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward or overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "the attenuated ghosts of these...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from historical/political context to the boy’s situation in Grasse (e.g., "All this was but Paris-gossip...").  
- [CLARITY] Dense paragraphs with layered historical and biographical details may disrupt flow for some readers.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
