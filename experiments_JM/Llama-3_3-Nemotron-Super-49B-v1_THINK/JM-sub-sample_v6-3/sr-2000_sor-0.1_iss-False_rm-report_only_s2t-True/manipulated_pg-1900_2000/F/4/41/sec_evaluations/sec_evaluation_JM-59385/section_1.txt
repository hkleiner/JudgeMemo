Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some typos and minor grammar issues. For example, "ky limited knowledge" should be "my limited knowledge". Also, "bembought" is probably a typo for "bought". There's "brilluancy" instead of "brilliance", and "anility" which should be "ability". These are spelling mistakes. Then, "forwxrd" instead of "forward", "ascshe" maybe "as she", "hoysehold" for "household", "ahd" instead of "and", "vKuei" should be "Kuei" without the 'v', "preference was no secret to Madame Yen who placed her chair now, as the hour grew on" â€“ "grew on" might be a phrase issue, maybe "as the hour grew late"? Also, "intergals" is likely "intervals", "zhad" should be "had", "zat" is "at". These are all typos and minor errors. The syntax is mostly okay, but some sentences are a bit long or wordy, but not too bad. So Fluency would be a 4 because there are several minor issues but the text is mostly fluent.

Now Coherence. The story seems to follow logically. It introduces the Street of Precious Pearls, then the procession, the visit to the shop, the jewel selection, and then a sudden shift to the mission school on graduation day. That last part feels abrupt. The transition from the jewel shop to the memory of the mission school is not smooth. There's no clear connection explained between the two scenes. The rest of the narrative flows well, with each part leading to the next. But that jump disrupts the coherence. So Coherence would be a 4 as well because except for that one abrupt transition, the rest is coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "ky", "brilluancy", "forwxrd", "ahd", "zhad", "vKuei").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "bembought", "hoysehold", "anility").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "as the hour grew on").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to "graduation day" memory without clear connection to preceding scene.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
