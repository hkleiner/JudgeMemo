Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from 1916, so some archaic terms or spellings might be present, but the main points are grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Scanning through, I notice a few typos like "tf" instead of "to", "lrincesses" (should be princesses), "sge" (seventh?), "Secretariex" (Secretaries), "oeuvre" is correctly used but might be considered less common. Also, "thousand and ohe" (one) phases. These are minor but present. The structure of sentences is mostly clear, though some are long and complex. The flow is generally smooth despite a few errors. So Fluency might be a 4 because the issues are minor and don't disrupt much.

For Coherence, the narrative jumps a bit. The author starts talking about the war zone, then shifts to trying to meet bourgeoisie, then back to the war zone efforts. There's a clear progression in the attempts to get permission, but some transitions feel abrupt, like moving from discussing society to the war zone again. The structure is mostly logical, but some parts might feel disconnected. For example, the initial paragraphs about the bourgeoisie and then diving into the war zone application process. However, the overall story follows the author's quest, so it's coherent but with some weak transitions. Coherence score might be 4 as well, since the main points connect, but there are slight disconnects.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor typos (e.g., "tf", "lrincesses", "sge", "Secretariex", "ohe").  
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "oeuvre", "sauv conduit").  
- [SYNTAX] Rarely awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between themes (e.g., bourgeoisie critique â†’ war zone logistics).  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness in anecdotal sequencing (e.g., duchess introduction feels slightly tangential).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
