Okay, let me start by reading through the current segment carefully. The task is to evaluate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

First, Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning the text, I notice a few typos like "civic corporation" should be "civil" maybe? Wait, "civic" could be correct in context. Wait, the text says "civic corporation"—maybe that's intended. Hmm. Then "uncettain" should be "uncertain". "comandante" is misspelled, should be "commandante". "border-tkwn" is a typo for "border-town". Also, "Philoppines" should be "Philippines". "Zepeda succeeded Ybarbo as Lieutenant Governor, and in turn wascfollowed"—"was followed" has an extra 'c'. "jnto" in "jn the plot" is a typo for "into". "Frsnch" should be "French". These are clear spelling errors.

For syntax or grammar, the sentences are mostly complex but structured. However, some sentences are quite long and might be a bit awkward. For example, the part about Gil Ybarbo's titles is a long sentence. But overall, the flow is good despite the typos. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt reading. So Fluency score might be 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text is a historical narrative, and the structure seems logical. It moves from the founding to events in 1800. However, there are abrupt shifts between topics. For example, after discussing Ybarbo's removal, it jumps to Nacogdoches being the second largest town, then suddenly introduces Philip Nolan's expedition. The transition between the end of the previous chapter and this section might feel a bit disconnected, but within the current segment, the flow is mostly logical. The part about the Louisiana purchase at the end feels tacked on without clear connection to the preceding Nolan expedition. Also, some paragraphs have multiple unrelated points. For example, the paragraph about the investigation and Ybarbo's removal, then mentioning the new officials, then the town's size. These could be smoother transitions. But overall, the narrative holds together. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but mostly coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "uncettain" (uncertain), "comandante" (commandante), "border-tkwn" (border-town), "Philoppines" (Philippines), "wascfollowed" (was followed), "jn" (into), "Frsnch" (French)  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Gil Ybarbo... was officially known as...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Ybarbo’s removal to "Nacogdoches was at that time the second largest town in Texas"  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential mention of Louisiana Purchase at the end without clear connection to preceding narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
