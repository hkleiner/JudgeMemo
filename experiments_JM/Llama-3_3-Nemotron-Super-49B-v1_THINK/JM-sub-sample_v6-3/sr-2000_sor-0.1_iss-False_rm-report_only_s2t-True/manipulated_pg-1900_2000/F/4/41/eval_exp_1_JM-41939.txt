Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to evaluate both Fluency and Coherence based on the section reports. 

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have issues. Section 1 has a Fluency score of 4.0 with multiple typos, minor punctuation issues, and some archaic vocabulary. Section 2 drops to 3.5 with more typos and awkward phrasing. The typos are frequent in both parts, which is a big factor. Even though the grammar issues are minor, the accumulation of spelling mistakes might affect the flow. The scale says a 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues not disrupting readability. But since both sections have noticeable typos, maybe it's slightly below 4? Wait, section 1 is 4.0, section 2 is 3.5. Average might be around 3.75, but since the first part is better, maybe overall 4.0? But the typos are mentioned as multiple in both, which could make it a 3.5? Hmm. The definition for 4 is "mostly fluent, minor issues noticeable but don't disrupt." If the typos are frequent but not too bad, maybe 4 is still okay. But section 2's 3.5 indicates more problems. So averaging, maybe 3.8, which would round to 4.0? Or maybe 3.5 overall? Wait, the user said to detect recurring or serious problems. The spelling errors are recurring across both sections. That's a serious issue for fluency. So even if grammar is mostly okay, the typos might bring it down. So maybe Fluency is 3.5?

Now Coherence. Both sections have a 4.0 in coherence. Issues in section 1 include abrupt transitions and repetitive relocations without links. Section 2 has slight abruptness between paragraphs and a tangential note. The coherence scale for 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The problems here are present but not severe. The main issues are transitions and some structure, but overall the text holds. So maybe Coherence stays at 4.0.

Wait, but section 1's coherence issues are more significant: abrupt transitions and repetitive mentions. But the score given was 4.0. So if the evaluator already considered those and still gave 4, maybe the overall is 4.0. Similarly, section 2's issues are slight. So averaging, Coherence is 4.0.

So final scores: Fluency 3.5 (because of frequent typos across both sections affecting fluency more than initially scored in each section), Coherence 4.0.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
