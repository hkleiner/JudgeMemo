Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. The text provided is a section from a biography about Fragonard, starting from his birth and early life up to his father apprenticing him to a notary, which conflicts with his artistic inclinations.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the text, the first thing that stands out is the opening sentence: "Sea her, town THE where-grey on up blue stretch the BEGINNINGS Alps..." This seems like a jumbled mix of words. It looks like there might be missing punctuation or incorrect word order. Maybe it's supposed to describe the landscape but is fragmented. That's a clear syntax issue. 

Further on, there are long, complex sentences. For example, the paragraph describing the glovemaker's view has multiple clauses stacked without clear transitions. The sentence structure is mostly correct, but the length and density might make it hard to follow. Also, some phrases like "embowered romantic little 's high" are unclear. The apostrophe in "little 's" doesn't make sense; maybe it's a typo or incorrect usage. 

Checking for grammar errors, I notice "the dark-eyed, long-nosed folk that trudged" uses "that" instead of "who," which is a grammatical error in subject-verb agreement for people. Also, "the wizardry of the flower-garden of France never left him" is a bit awkward in phrasing, though not strictly incorrect. 

Spelling seems okay, but there's "petticoats" which is correct, but the context of "ruling France from behind petticoats" is a bit archaic but understandable. 

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect. The text jumps between describing Fragonard's birth, his environment, historical events in Paris (like the Pompadour's influence), and then back to his life in Grasse. The transitions between these sections feel abrupt. For example, after detailing the Pompadour's actions, it suddenly shifts to Grasse without a clear link. The chapter break to "ROME" also feels sudden, though the content after doesn't seem to relate to Rome yet. 

There's repetition in mentioning the contrast between Grasse's slow pace and Paris's influence, which might be intentional but could be smoother. The historical context (like the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle) is relevant but integrated somewhat clumsily, disrupting the flow of Fragonard's biography. 

For Fluency score: Despite some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? It's generally readable but with multiple issues.

For Coherence: The abrupt shifts between historical events and the protagonist's life, plus the chapter title "ROME" without context, cause confusion. The ideas are mostly connected but with noticeable problems. So a Coherence score of 3, as it's generally coherent but with significant disruptions.

Wait, but the historical parts are part of setting the time period. Maybe the transitions could be better, but the overall structure follows Fragonard's life interspersed with historical context. However, the jump to "ROME" without explanation is a problem. Also, the shift from the Pompadour's influence back to Grasse feels disconnected. 

So Fluency: Multiple syntax and grammar issues, some unclear phrases, but overall understandable. Score 3.5.

Coherence: Abrupt transitions, especially the "ROME" chapter without lead-in, and some disconnected historical inserts. But the overall narrative follows Fragonard's early life with context. Score 3.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Fragmented opening sentence ("Sea her...") with unclear word order. - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect pronoun usage ("folk that trudged" instead of "who"). - [LEXICON] Unclear phrases (e.g., "little 's high").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to "ROME" chapter without context. - [TRANSITION] Disconnected historical details (e.g., Pompadour’s rise) from protagonist’s narrative.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
