Okay, let's tackle this. So I need to rate the overall Fluency and Coherence of the text based on the two sections provided. Let's start with Fluency.

First, looking at section_01, Fluency is 3.5. The issue here is archaic vocabulary, which might cause minor readability. Then section_02 has a Fluency score of 2.5 with more serious problems: disjointed sentence structure and incoherent word order. Those are bigger issues than just old words. So the first section is somewhat okay but the second has major flaws. Since Fluency is about how smoothly it reads, the severe syntax and grammar issues in section_02 would drag the overall score down. The average might be around (3.5 + 2.5)/2 = 3, but since the problems in section_02 are more impactful (like making sentences hard to understand), maybe it's a bit lower. So maybe 2.5 or 3? Let me check the scale. A 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues interrupting flow." Section_02's issues are frequent and disrupting, so overall, maybe 2.5?

Now Coherence. Section_01 is 4.0 with an abrupt transition but otherwise okay. Section_02 is 3.5 with another abrupt shift. So both sections have transition issues. The first section's coherence is mostly good except one part, the second has more problems. Average would be (4 + 3.5)/2 = 3.75, but considering both have transition problems, maybe around 3.5? But the scale for 3.5 in Coherence is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." Since both sections have abrupt shifts, it's consistent. So maybe 3.5 overall.

Wait, but section_02's coherence is 3.5, which already accounts for its problems. So combining the two, maybe the overall Coherence is between 3.5 and 4.0. But since both have transition issues, perhaps 3.5 is right. For Fluency, the second section's severe issues might make the overall lower. So Fluency 2.5 and Coherence 3.5?

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
