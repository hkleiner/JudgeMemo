Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided and ignore the previous section, even though it's given for context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. The text seems mostly well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. However, there are a few points that catch my attention. For example, the sentence structure in some parts is a bit complex, which might make it slightly less fluent. Also, there's a part towards the end that appears to have a jumbled sentence: "Perhaps site Saxon until the Martin it early 's, very on part discoveries St. will seems but standing inby of as be a solved very wiser problem Roman, the further then restored regard probably building to being the church." This looks like a typo or a severely garbled sentence, which would definitely affect fluency. 

Now, checking the Fluency scale: A score of 5 requires minimal to no issues. Here, despite the main text being fluent, that one jumbled sentence is a major flaw. So maybe a 4? But wait, the rest of the text has some complex sentences but no other errors. The jumbled part is significant though. Maybe 3.5 because it's mostly fluent but with a notable error.

Next, Coherence. The text follows a logical timeline from Ethelbert's power to Augustine's arrival and the Christianization process. The ideas connect well, explaining the historical events step by step. However, there's a shift towards the end discussing St. Martin's church and the debate about its origins. This part feels a bit abrupt compared to the rest, which is more narrative. The transition here isn't smooth, disrupting the coherence slightly. Also, the last paragraph about the church's structure and the argument between antiquaries might feel like a tangent, though it's related. 

Coherence scale: A 5 would mean perfectly logical progression. Here, the abrupt shift and the somewhat disconnected discussion about the church's architecture might deduct a point. So maybe a 4? But the main narrative flows well, so perhaps 4 is appropriate.

Wait, the Coherence issues: The main problem is the transition to St. Martin's discussion. It's related but feels like a separate topic without a clear link. That's a STRUCTURE issue. Also, the last jumbled sentence affects both Fluency and maybe Clarity in Coherence, but since it's part of the same problematic sentence, maybe it's better to focus on STRUCTURE for the coherence issue.

Finalizing: Fluency has a major syntax/spelling issue in one sentence, so score 3.5. Coherence has a structure issue with the transition, so score 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Severe sentence fragmentation ("Perhaps site Saxon...") - [SPELLING/Grammar] Unintelligible sentence structure in final paragraph  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to St. Martinâ€™s church discussion without clear narrative link  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
