Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The text seems mostly clear, but there are a few spots. For example, "Having of beside to a are window can the as to lay noon-learn the the lower--going you half their where schoolchildren case wave an proudly they hour you home leisure of meal." That part is really confusing. Looks like a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order and missing structure. That's a big syntax and grammar problem. Also, "at man and ’s of fifteen week spoken as you in 85 are receiving a--a ’foreman wages aredollars fifteen." This part has punctuation errors and unclear phrasing, maybe missing words. There's "heated (?) with one stove"—the question mark in parentheses is odd, maybe a typo or unclear notation. A few other minor issues like "your your for mother house" (though that's in the previous context, so maybe not counted here). Wait, no, the current segment's issues only. Let me check again. The confusing sentence about the window and schoolchildren is definitely in the current segment. Also, "the kind with a lever, like the ones shown in the Youth’s Companion" is in the previous context, so not relevant here. 

For Coherence, the story seems to follow a timeline: getting in trouble in math, asking to work, job at the newspaper, promotions, interactions with the editor and fake sellers. But there are abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from working at the press to describing the Peninsula Record and the job offer, then moving to the new building, and then suddenly talking about traveling fakers. The transition to the faker selling soap feels a bit abrupt without clear connection to the preceding paragraphs. Also, the sentence structure varies; some parts are concise, others have longer, more descriptive passages. The part about the faker and the editor's reaction might feel disconnected from the job progression narrative. However, overall, the coherence is generally maintained through the protagonist's experiences, so maybe a score of 4? But the abrupt shifts might deduct a point, making it 3.5?

Wait, the Coherence scale says a 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," and 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." The transitions between job changes and the faker part might be considered a weak link. So maybe Coherence is 3.5.

For Fluency, despite some major syntax issues in a couple of sentences, the rest of the text is readable. The jumbled sentences are significant, so Fluency might be around 3, since "generally readable but multiple issues." But if those errors are frequent, maybe 2.5? Let me check again. The majority of the text is fluent, but there are a couple of severely flawed sentences. The scale says 3 is "generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues." So 3 might be appropriate.

Finalizing: Fluency Issues would include the jumbled syntax in the window paragraph and the unclear sentence about wages. Coherence Issues might include the abrupt transition to the faker scene. Scores: Fluency 3, Coherence 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severely jumbled sentence structure (e.g., "Having of beside to a are window...").  
- [GRAMMAR/PUNCTUATION] Confusing phrasing and missing/poor punctuation (e.g., "at man and ’s of fifteen week...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from job narrative to describing traveling fakers without clear connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3**
