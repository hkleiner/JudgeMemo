Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text. Starting with Fluency, I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and overall flow. The text seems mostly well-written, but there might be some archaic language or complex sentences that could affect readability. For example, phrases like "the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe" are poetic but might feel a bit outdated or overly formal. Also, there's a part with "Wong each, with, the both chess which slowly ’s his toward yield at Lui each too carefully loved dearly of the players..." which looks like a typo or jumbled words, disrupting fluency.

Now, Coherence. The story seems to follow a logical sequence: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the procession, the shop visit, and then a flashback. However, the transition to the memory of the mission school feels abrupt. The sentence "With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically, Kuei Ping was back in memory..." might be too sudden without a clearer transition. Also, the connection between the jewel selection and the graduation memory isn't immediately clear, which could confuse the reader.

For Fluency score, despite some minor issues and one major typo, the text is generally fluent. Maybe a 4? For Coherence, the abrupt transition and lack of clear connection between scenes might drop it to a 3.5. Wait, but the rest of the narrative flows well. The flashback, though sudden, is a common literary device. Maybe Coherence is a 4? Need to weigh the impact of that transition.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly formal sentence structures (e.g., "the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe").  
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Apparent typo/jumbled text ("Wong each, with, the both chess...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary/phrasing (e.g., "passively quiet," "lend light, lend light").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to Kuei Ping’s memory of the mission school without clear contextual bridge.  
- [STRUCTURE] Subplot introduction (graduation memory) feels disconnected from the jewel-shopping scene.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
