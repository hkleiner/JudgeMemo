Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to rate the overall Fluency and Coherence of the text based on the section-wise report provided. 

Starting with Fluency. Each section has a Fluency score of 3.5. The issues mentioned are syntax problems like severe sentence fragmentation and garbled structures. For example, in section_01, there's "Accordingly battle a really..." which is fragmented. Section_02 has a sentence that's severely garbled: "the face, rendered who that introduced time and he young for...". Also, there's a lexicon issue with a confusing phrase about Meissonier's age. 

Looking at the Fluency scale, a 3.5 means "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow." Since both sections have the same score and similar issues, the overall Fluency is likely around 3.5. But wait, the problems are recurring across both sections. The syntax errors are severe but maybe not frequent enough to drop to a 3. The definition for 3 is "multiple issues that interrupt flow in noticeable ways." Here, the issues are present but maybe not overwhelming the entire text. So maybe stick with 3.5 for Fluency.

Now Coherence. Section_01 has a 3.5, and section_02 has 4.0. Issues in section_01 include incoherent phrases and logical jumps. Section_02 has an abrupt transition from poverty to decorating fans, and unclear resolution about the publisher conversation. 

The Coherence scale: A 3.5 is "Generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts." Section_01's issues are more severe (incoherent phrases, jumps), while section_02 has a 4.0 with some transitions and clarity problems but less severe. Since one section is 3.5 and the other 4.0, averaging might give around 3.75, but since we can use half-points, maybe 3.5 or 4.0. However, the more severe issues in section_01 might bring the overall score down. The transition in section_02 is abrupt but maybe not as bad as the incoherent phrases. So perhaps the overall Coherence is 3.5, balancing the two sections.

Wait, but section_02's coherence is 4.0, which is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The average between 3.5 and 4.0 is 3.75, which would round to 3.75, but since the user allows half-points, maybe 3.75 is possible. However, looking at the criteria, a 4 requires only a few weak parts that don't disrupt much. Section_01 has more significant coherence issues, so maybe the overall is 3.5. Alternatively, if the second section's higher score compensates, but given that both sections contribute, perhaps 3.5 is more accurate for Coherence as well.

So final scores: Fluency 3.5, Coherence 3.5.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
