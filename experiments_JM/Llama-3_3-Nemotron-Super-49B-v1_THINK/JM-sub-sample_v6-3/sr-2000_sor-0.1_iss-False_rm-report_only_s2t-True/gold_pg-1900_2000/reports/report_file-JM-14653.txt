  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "And we ate, and we drank, and we ate again...") may interrupt smooth reading flow.
    - [LEXICON]:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from nostalgic reflection to addressing hypothetical critics ("If any person here breaks in...") without clear bridging.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Chapter Two introduction ("If the decadence...") assumes prior context about "decadence" not fully resolved in the evaluated segment.
