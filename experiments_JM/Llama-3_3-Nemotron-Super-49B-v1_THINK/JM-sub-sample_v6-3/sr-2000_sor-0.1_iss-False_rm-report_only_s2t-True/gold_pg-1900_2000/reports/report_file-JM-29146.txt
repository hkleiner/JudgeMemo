Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Intentional lisp in dialogue may slightly impede readability;
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., Irwadi’s titanium importance explanation).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from Polaris scene to Englander conversation without clear connector;
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Sudden introduction of mind-reading Earthgirl subplot feels disconnected.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–13232):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 5.0
  - Coherence: 4.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • A few long, complex sentences (e.g., Ramsey’s internal monologue about rent and Irwadian customs) slightly disrupt flow but remain clear.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from Englander’s flat to the gambling hall without explicit connective tissue (e.g., “He went out into the gathering dusk” feels slightly disconnected from the subsequent scene setup).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Minor ambiguity in the Irwadian’s motivation (drunkenness vs. ideological anger) that could be slightly more nuanced.
