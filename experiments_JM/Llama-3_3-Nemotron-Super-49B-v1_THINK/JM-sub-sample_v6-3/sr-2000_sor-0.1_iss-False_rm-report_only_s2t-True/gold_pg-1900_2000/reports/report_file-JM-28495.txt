  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasionally archaic vocabulary (e.g., "seraphically," "bonhomie") may cause minor pauses for modern readers.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • A few very long, complex sentences (e.g., the paragraph describing the dog breed debate) require careful parsing.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from discussing dog breeds to following the Battersea official feels slightly abrupt, though contextually justified.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Minor meandering in descriptive asides (e.g., the butcher shop interaction) briefly slows narrative focus.
