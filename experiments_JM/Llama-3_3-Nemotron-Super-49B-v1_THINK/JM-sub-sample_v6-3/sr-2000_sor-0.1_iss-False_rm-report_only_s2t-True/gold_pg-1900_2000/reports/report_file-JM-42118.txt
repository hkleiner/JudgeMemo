        • Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shifts between Grasse’s description, historical events, and artistic context (e.g., jumps from Fragonard’s childhood to Pompadour’s influence).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Historical details (e.g., Louis XV’s scandals) feel slightly disconnected from Fragonard’s narrative arc.
