  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of archaic vocabulary (e.g., "betwixt," "thou") and complex sentence structures may hinder readability for modern audiences.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences require careful parsing.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing Brueghel’s influence to Millet’s personal struggles without explicit connection.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Tangential remark about appreciating atmospheric effects (final paragraph) feels loosely integrated.

Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., lengthy descriptive passages in "The Sheep Pen" paragraph) that slightly impede smooth reading.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Minor repetition of thematic emphasis (e.g., "peasant's labour" motifs) without significant variation.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift after "La Baigneuse" example to the statement "Millet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter" without clear connective tissue.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Slight disjointedness between artwork analyses (e.g., "The Sheep Pen") and broader biographical/generalizations (e.g., poverty, peasant focus) without explicit thematic bridges.
