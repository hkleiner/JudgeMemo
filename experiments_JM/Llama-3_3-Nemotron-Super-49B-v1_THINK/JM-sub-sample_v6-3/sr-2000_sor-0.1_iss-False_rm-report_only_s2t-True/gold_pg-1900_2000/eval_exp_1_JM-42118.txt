Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence for the entire text based on the two sections provided. Each section has its own scores and issues. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at section_01, Fluency is 4.5. The issues mentioned are overly elaborate vocabulary and convoluted sentence structures. Section_02 also has Fluency 4.5 with similar syntax issues and some archaic phrasing. The fluency scores are high in both sections, but there are some minor problems. The vocabulary might slow reading, and the complex sentences could impede clarity a bit. However, since both sections are 4.5, which is "mostly fluent" with minor issues, the overall Fluency should be around 4.5. But wait, the archaic terms in section_02 might affect modern readers more. But the report says they're rare. So maybe the overall Fluency is still 4.5.

Now for Coherence. Both sections have Coherence 4.0. The issues are abrupt shifts between different topics like description, history, and art context. Also, historical details feel disconnected from the narrative. In section_02, similar structure issues and lacking transitions between paragraphs. The coherence scores are 4.0, which means "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The problems are noticeable but don't disrupt much. However, the abrupt shifts and disconnected historical details are recurring. Since both sections have the same score and similar issues, the overall Coherence should be 4.0. But I need to check if the issues accumulate. The report mentions "frequent" shifts and disconnections, but the score is 4.0. So maybe 4.0 is correct. Wait, the criteria for 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," which matches. So I think both final scores would be 4.5 for Fluency and 4.0 for Coherence.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
