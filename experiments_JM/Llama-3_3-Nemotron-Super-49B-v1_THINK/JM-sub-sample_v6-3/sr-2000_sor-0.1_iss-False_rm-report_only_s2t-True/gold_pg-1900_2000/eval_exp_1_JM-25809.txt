Okay, let's tackle this. So, the task is to rate the overall Fluency and Coherence of a text based on the section-wise report provided. The user wants the final scores in the specific format without any explanations.

First, I need to understand the criteria for each metric. Fluency is about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., making the text smooth. Coherence is about the logical flow, connections between ideas, no abrupt jumps, etc.

Looking at the report, there are two sections. Both sections have Fluency and Coherence scores of 5.0. But there are some issues listed under each.

For Fluency in section_01, the issue is archaic slang that might impede modern readers. Similarly, in section_02, informal colloquialisms could affect formal readability. However, both sections still scored 5.0 in Fluency. The key here is that despite these lexical choices, the fluency isn't significantly impacted. The definition for Fluency score 5 says "minimal to no grammatical issues" and errors don't distract. Since the issues are about word choice (lexicon) but not syntax or grammar errors, maybe they don't reduce the fluency score much. The report's scores already accounted for these, so overall Fluency might still be high.

For Coherence, section_01 has a slight abruptness in introducing Bud's arrival, but it's mitigated. Section_02 has a sudden shift to an anecdote, but it's contextual in dialogue. Both sections scored 5.0 in Coherence. Coherence score 5 requires a clear logical progression with minor lapses. The issues here are minor and don't disrupt the flow significantly. So even with those transitions, the overall coherence is maintained.

Since both sections are perfect in their scores with only minor, mitigated issues, the overall scores should be high. But wait, the user has to detect recurring or serious problems. The lexicon issues in both sections are about informal or archaic language, but since they're labeled as not seriously impacting (the scores are 5), maybe they're just minor. The coherence issues are also minor and mitigated.

So for Fluency, despite two sections with lexicon issues, since they didn't affect the section scores, the overall Fluency would still be 5. Similarly, Coherence has minor transitions but overall scored 5 in both sections, so overall Coherence is 5.

But wait, the criteria for score 5 in Coherence says "minor lapses... barely noticeable". The issues here are slight abruptness and sudden shifts, but mitigated. So they might be considered minor. Hence, both metrics deserve 5.
