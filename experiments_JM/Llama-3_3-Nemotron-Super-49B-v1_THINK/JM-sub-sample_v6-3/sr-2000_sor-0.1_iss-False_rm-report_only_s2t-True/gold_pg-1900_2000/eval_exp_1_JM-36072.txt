Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to rate the entire text's Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report. 

First, I need to look at each section's scores and issues. For Fluency, both sections have 4.0. The issues in Fluency are mainly complex sentences and some archaic terms. But since the scores are 4.0, that means they're mostly fluent with minor issues. The examples given, like overly complex sentences and untranslated terms, are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. So overall, Fluency should be around 4.0. Maybe 4.0 is right because both sections are consistent in their fluency issues but still manageable.

Now for Coherence. Section 1 has 3.5 and Section 2 has 3.0. The issues here are abrupt shifts, dense leaps between ideas, and lack of transitions. Section 1's coherence is somewhat better but still has notable problems. Section 2 drops to 3.0 with more abrupt topic shifts and missing connections. Coherence is about the whole text's flow. Since both sections have coherence issues, especially section 2 being worse, the overall Coherence score should be between 3.0 and 3.5. Maybe 3.25? But the scale allows half-points. Wait, the user allows half-points like 3.5. Let me check the criteria.

For Coherence, a 3 is "Generally coherent but with noticeable issues affecting the reading experience." A 3.5 would be better than that. Section 1 is 3.5 (some issues but manageable), Section 2 is 3.0 (more problems). Average might be around 3.25, but since the problems are recurring across both sections, maybe it's better to round to 3.0 or 3.5? Wait, the overall impact: the text has several abrupt shifts and lack of transitions in both sections. So even though section 1 is 3.5, the combined effect might bring it down. But the criteria for 3.0 is "generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts..." which fits. However, since one section is 3.5 and the other 3.0, maybe the average is 3.25, but since we can't use quarters, maybe 3.0 or 3.5. Hmm. The report says in section 1, there are transitions and structure issues, and section 2 has worse structure and transitions. So overall, the coherence is compromised in both parts. The average would be (3.5 + 3)/2 = 3.25, which would round to 3.0 or 3.5? But the user might expect to consider the severity. Since both sections have significant coherence issues, maybe 3.0 is more accurate because the problems are consistent. Alternatively, if one part is 3.5 and the other 3.0, maybe 3.25 isn't an option, so pick the lower since the worse section brings it down. 

Wait, the Coherence scale for 3.0 says "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts..." which matches both sections. So maybe the overall Coherence is 3.0. But section 1 was 3.5, which is better. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 3.0 is too low if one section is 3.5. Let me think again. The Coherence issues in both sections are similar: abrupt shifts, lack of transitions. So even though section 1 is slightly better, the overall text has these problems throughout. So averaging might not be the right approach; instead, considering the overall impact. Since both sections contribute to the coherence being problematic, maybe the final score is 3.0. 

Alternatively, maybe 3.5 for Coherence if the issues aren't too severe. Wait, section 1's coherence is 3.5, which is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," and section 2 is 3.0, which is "generally coherent but with noticeable issues." So combining these, the overall might be around 3.25, but since we can't do quarters, perhaps 3.0 or 3.5. The user might expect to round down because the second section is worse. So I'll go with 3.0 for Coherence.

Fluency is straightforward: both sections 4.0, so 4.0 overall.

So final scores: Fluency 4.0, Coherence 3.0.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
