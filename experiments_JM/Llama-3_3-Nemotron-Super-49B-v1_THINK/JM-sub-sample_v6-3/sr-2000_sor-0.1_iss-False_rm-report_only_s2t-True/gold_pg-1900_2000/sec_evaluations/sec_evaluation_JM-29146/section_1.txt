Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly readable, but there are some issues. The Port Security Officer's dialogue has a pronounced lisp, which is intentional for characterization but might cause minor readability issues. For example, "thith" instead of "this" or "lispeth" for "lips". However, since it's consistent and part of the character's speech, it's not a grammar error per se, but might affect fluency slightly. Also, some sentences are a bit long or have complex structures, like the paragraph describing Irwadi's importance and Chind Ramar's thoughts. These could interrupt the flow a bit. But overall, the text flows well with proper grammar and spelling. So Fluency is probably a 4, maybe 4.5, but the lisp and some long sentences might bring it down to 4.

Now Coherence. The story seems to follow logically. The scene starts with Ramsey at the port, learns about the planetarization, deals with the consequences, then cuts to him talking with Englander about their situation. The transitions between scenes are clear. However, there's a shift from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the Englander scene without a clear transition marker. Also, the introduction of the Earthgirl who can read minds feels a bit abrupt and not fully integrated into the rest of the scene. Her panic and thought about avoiding panic might not be fully connected to the main plot thread yet. So Coherence might be a 4 because the main flow is logical, but there are some minor disconnects and abrupt introductions.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Intentional lisp in dialogue may slightly impede readability; - [LEXICON] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., Irwadiâ€™s titanium importance explanation).
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Polaris scene to Englander conversation without clear connector; - [CLARITY] Sudden introduction of mind-reading Earthgirl subplot feels disconnected.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
