Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older style, maybe early 20th century, judging by the language and structure. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice some archaic phrasing like "thou" isn't here, but constructions like "it is to be found" are a bit formal. There's a sentence: "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet..."—"passively quiet" seems a bit redundant; maybe "sat quietly" would be better. Also, "the hour grew on" is an old way of saying "as time passed." These aren't errors but might make the text less fluent for modern readers. No obvious grammar or spelling mistakes, though. So Fluency is high but not perfect due to outdated style and some wordy phrases.

Now Coherence. The narrative flows logically, describing the scene in the street and the shop. Transitions between paragraphs are smooth. However, there's a sudden shift when Kuei Ping reminisces about the mission school. The transition here feels abrupt without a clear connector. It breaks the flow from the jewel selection scene to the memory. That's a coherence issue. Otherwise, the story is well-structured and easy to follow. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are LEXICON (archaic terms) and SYNTAX (long, complex sentences). For Coherence, the abrupt transition is a STRUCTURE issue. 

Scoring: Fluency is mostly fluent but with some minor issues, so 4. Coherence has a notable transition problem but overall logical, so 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "the hour grew on," "passively quiet") may reduce modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., nested clauses) slow the flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unmarked transition from the jewel-buying scene to Kuei Ping’s memory of the mission school disrupts continuity.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
