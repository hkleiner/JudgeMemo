Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The text seems mostly well-written, but there are a few points. For example, "the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling" might be a bit wordy, but it's not incorrect. The phrase "when we arose to dress" is a bit old-fashioned but still clear. The main issue I notice is the sentence structure in some parts, like the long list of people on the bridge. It's a bit cumbersome but not grammatically wrong. Maybe some commas could improve clarity, but overall, the text is fluent with minor issues. So Fluency might score a 4.

Now Coherence. The section starts talking about discomfort from wet clothing, then jumps to the history of Manila. That's a abrupt transition without a clear link. The narrative shifts from personal experience to historical description and then back to the scene on the bridge. These shifts might feel disconnected. The part about the notice at the end also seems out of place; it introduces a new element without setup. However, each paragraph itself is coherent, but the connections between them are weak. So Coherence might be around 3.5 because while there are transitions, the overall flow between topics isn't smooth.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Wordy phrasing ("excessive disagreeableness of the feeling")  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure (e.g., lengthy lists without clear pauses)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from personal discomfort to historical description  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between paragraphs (e.g., bridge scene to notice posting)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
