Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence based on the given report.

First, looking at Fluency. Both sections have a 5.0 score. The first section has no issues. The second section mentions a Fluency Issue with slightly formal, archaic vocabulary that might impede modern readability. But the score was still 5.0 for that section. The definition for Fluency 5 says minimal to no grammatical issues, and errors shouldn't distract. Even though there's a note about vocabulary, since the score per section is 5, maybe the annotator didn't consider it a major issue. The vocabulary is formal but not incorrect. So overall Fluency should stay at 5.0.

Now Coherence. Both sections are 5.0 as well. The second section has a minor contextual shift described as brief and logically integrated. The Coherence 5 scale allows for minor lapses that don't hinder understanding. Since the issue is minor and the section still scored 5, the overall Coherence should also be 5.0. There's no major disruption mentioned in either section. The minor shift is integrated logically, so it doesn't affect the overall coherence significantly.

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 5.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 5.0
