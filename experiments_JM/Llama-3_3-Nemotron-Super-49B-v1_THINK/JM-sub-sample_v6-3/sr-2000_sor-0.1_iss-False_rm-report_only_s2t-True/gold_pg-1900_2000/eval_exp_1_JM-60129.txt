Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the overall Fluency and Coherence of the text based on the section-wise report.

Starting with Fluency. Both sections have a Fluency score of 4.0. The issues mentioned are overly complex sentence structures in both sections, a minor typo in section 01, and specialized terms without explanation. Also, in section 02, there's awkward phrasing. 

The Fluency scale says a 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues that don't disrupt readability. The complex sentences and awkward phrasing are noticeable but don't seem to cause major comprehension problems. The typo is minor. So even though there are some issues, they're not frequent enough to drop it to a 3. So Fluency should stay around 4.0.

Now Coherence. Both sections are 3.5. Issues include abrupt transitions between segments, assuming background knowledge, abrupt topic shifts, and lack of thematic links between paragraphs. 

Coherence scale: 3.5 would mean generally coherent but with noticeable issues affecting the reading experience. The problems here are more impactfulâ€”abrupt shifts and lack of connections between paragraphs. These make the text less smooth but still understandable. Since both sections have similar issues, the overall Coherence is likely a 3.5. 

Wait, but should I average the section scores or consider the overall impact? The task says to detect recurring problems. Both sections have the same issues, so the overall would be 3.5 for Coherence. Fluency remains 4.0 as the issues are minor and don't accumulate to a lower score.

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
