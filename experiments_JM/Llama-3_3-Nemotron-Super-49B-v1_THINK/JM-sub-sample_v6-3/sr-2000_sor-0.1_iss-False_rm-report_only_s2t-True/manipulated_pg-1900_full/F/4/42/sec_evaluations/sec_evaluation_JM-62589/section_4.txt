Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I'll read through the current segment and note any issues. 

Looking at the text, I notice a few things. There's a sentence: "to kept his blood in circulation..." which should be "to keep" – that's a grammar error. Also, "elude those in command, and get out upon the roads leading to Boston and see if he could found any trace of his man." The correct word here is "find," not "found." These are minor but noticeable. 

Another spot: "You’ll get your chance. The new country will have to claim much good blood before it wins." The phrase "claim much good blood" might be a bit awkward in phrasing, though it's understandable. Then, "Molly, you’ll get your chance" – wait, earlier it was Robert speaking. Is "Molly" a mistake? The previous section mentions Robert, so maybe "Molly" is an error in character name. That's a coherence issue perhaps, but under fluency, if it's a typo, it's a spelling/error. But since it's a name, maybe it's a consistency error, which might fall under coherence. Hmm.

In the dialogue, there are several instances of "hic" to indicate drunkenness. While effective, if overused, it might affect fluency, but it's a stylistic choice. 

Now, checking for other grammar issues. The sentence "You might as well let us went" should be "let us go" or "let us leave." "Went" is incorrect here. Also, "Mason’s puzzled face turned from one to the other, “I don’t—know—what’s come over me—I can’t think clear, but something tells me to went—with this—one,”" – again, "went" instead of "go." 

So, multiple grammatical errors, especially with verb forms. These are distracting but the text is mostly readable. So for Fluency, the score would be around 3.5 maybe. Because there are several errors but the overall flow isn't severely impacted.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow, transitions, consistency. The story seems to follow Robert's quest to find Mason, encountering him, then the conflict with the British soldier who looks like Robert. The structure is mostly logical, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, when Robert finds Mason, the switch to the sentry's dialogue and then the arrival of the lookalike Britisher might feel a bit sudden. Also, the character "Molly" appears unexpectedly if it's a typo for Robert. If "Molly" is correct, then maybe it's a minor issue, but if it's an error, that disrupts coherence. 

Additionally, the part where Mason suddenly becomes soberer during the fight feels a bit convenient. The transition from his drunken state to sudden clarity might need smoother handling. Also, the introduction of the doppelganger Britisher is surprising but explained in context, so maybe that's okay. 

The segment also jumps from the camp's situation to Robert's escape and search for Mason without strong transitions. The scenes shift quickly, which might make the narrative a bit disjointed. However, the overall progression from Robert's desire to find Mason, the encounter, and the conflict is logical. 

So for Coherence, the issues are some abrupt transitions, possible character name inconsistency, and a convenient plot point with Mason's sobriety. But the main storyline holds. Score might be around 3.5 as well, since while there are issues, the narrative isn't hard to follow overall.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb forms ("to kept", "went" instead of "go")
- [SPELLING/CONSISTENCY] Potential character name inconsistency ("Molly" instead of "Robert")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("claim much good blood")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., camp to road encounter)
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained sobriety of Mason during conflict
- [CONSISTENCY] Unclear introduction of doppelganger character without setup

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
