Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The user mentioned not to consider the previous section, so I'll ignore that.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, it's a series of historical entries, each with different topics like the Old Stone Fort, missions, landmarks, etc. The structure seems to be a list of locations with their histories. 

Checking for grammar issues: I notice in the "MISSIONS AND PRESIDIO" part, "build" should be "built" (subject-verb agreement). That's a clear grammar error. Also, "1.25 miles northeast of Goodman crossing of the Angelina river" – "crossing" might be better as "crossing point" for clarity, but maybe that's just phrasing. 

Spelling? Let me check. "drouth" is an archaic spelling of "drought", which might be intentional in a historical context, so maybe not an error. "Los Terreros or Mill creek" – proper nouns, so probably correct. 

Syntax and phrasing: Some sentences are long and list multiple pieces of information without clear transitions. For example, the paragraph about the Oak Grove Cemetery lists several names and markers without connecting phrases, making it a bit choppy. 

For Coherence, it's about how the whole text hangs together. The current segment is a collection of separate historical points, each a standalone entry. There's no narrative flow connecting them; they seem like encyclopedia entries. Each topic shifts abruptly to the next without transitions. For example, moving from the Old Stone Fort to the Missions, then to the Stage Stand, etc., without any linking sentences. This lack of connectivity between sections would affect coherence.

So for Fluency, the main issues are the grammar mistake ("build" instead of "built") and some awkward phrasing in long sentences. For Coherence, the primary problem is the disjointed structure with no transitions between different historical entries.

Scoring Fluency: The grammar error is noticeable but not frequent. The text is mostly readable. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Coherence: Since the segments are separate and lack connection, but each part within itself is somewhat coherent, it's not totally incoherent. So maybe a 3, as there are noticeable abrupt shifts but the overall structure within each entry is okay.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("build" instead of "built" in "Presidio Nuestra Senora de los Dolores, build in 1716").  
   - [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, list-like sentences (e.g., Oak Grove Cemetery paragraph).  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts between historical entries without transitional links.  
   - [TRANSITION] Lack of cohesive narrative flow across segments.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
