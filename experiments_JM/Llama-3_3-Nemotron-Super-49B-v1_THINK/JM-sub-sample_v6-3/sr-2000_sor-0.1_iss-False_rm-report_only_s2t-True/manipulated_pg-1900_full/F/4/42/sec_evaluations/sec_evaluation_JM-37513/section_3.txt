Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided scales. I have to look for problems in each metric, summarize them, label the issues, and assign scores.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is quite dense and philosophical, with long sentences. Let me read through it carefully.

Looking at the text, the sentences are complex and lengthy. For example, "For Spencer, as for M. Bergson, we live in a world of change. But neither is content to accept changes as facts to be linked up within a scheme of scientific interpretation." These are clear but might be a bit cumbersome. Are there any grammatical errors? I don't see obvious ones. Maybe some word choice issues? The term "transfigured realism" and "transformed realism" might be specific jargon, but they seem appropriate in context. 

Wait, there's a part: "which, so far as one can make out, somehow produced precisely the same results." The phrase "so far as one can make out" is a bit informal in an otherwise formal text. That might be a minor fluency issue due to tone inconsistency. Also, the use of "I suppose" and "I gather" could make the text slightly less formal, but they're not errors. 

Another point: "It would take us too far from the line of Spencer's thought to consider M. Bergson's doctrine..." This is a clear transition, but the sentence structure is complex. Maybe some sentences are too long, causing slight difficulty in following, but overall, the text is well-structured with proper punctuation. No spelling mistakes noticed. 

So for Fluency, the main issues might be occasional informal phrases and very complex sentence structures, but no major errors. That would likely score a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The text discusses Spencer and Bergson's philosophies, comparing their concepts. The structure seems to follow a logical comparison, but there are some shifts. For example, the text moves from discussing the Unknowable to Bergson's critique, then to their shared quest for a Source, and later to Spencer's philosophy of science. The transitions between these sections might not be perfectly smooth. 

There's a part where the author says, "It would take us too far from the line of Spencer's thought to consider M. Bergson's doctrine..." which might feel like a slight detour, but it's acknowledged by the author. Also, the paragraph about Bertrand Russell and Professor Mach feels a bit tacked on, though it relates to Spencer's use of "cause." 

The text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about Spencer and Bergson, which could make it less clear for readers without that background. However, within the segment itself, the ideas are mostly connected, even if densely packed. The author summarizes points and connects them, like comparing the Unknowable with Life. 

So for Coherence, the issues might be the assumption of background knowledge and some abrupt transitions between paragraphs, but overall the structure holds. Score might be 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak connections.

Wait, but let me check again. The text jumps between criticizing Spencer's method, discussing Bergson's views, then moving to the philosophy of science. Each paragraph has its topic, but the flow between them could be smoother. However, the author does use transitional phrases like "Now" or "For Spencer, as for M. Bergson," which help. The main problem might be the density and the need for readers to keep track of multiple philosophical concepts without clear headings. But since the segment is part of a larger document, some context is expected. 

Given that, Coherence score might still be 4, with some minor disconnects but overall logical progression. 

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor issues with sentence complexity and informal tone in some phrases), Coherence 4 (mostly logical but some transitions could be better, and high density).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., nested clauses)  
- [LEXICON] Informal tone in phrases (e.g., "so far as one can make out")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between philosophical concepts (e.g., shift to Russell/Mach)  
- [CLARITY] Assumes specialized knowledge of Spencer/Bergsonâ€™s theories  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
