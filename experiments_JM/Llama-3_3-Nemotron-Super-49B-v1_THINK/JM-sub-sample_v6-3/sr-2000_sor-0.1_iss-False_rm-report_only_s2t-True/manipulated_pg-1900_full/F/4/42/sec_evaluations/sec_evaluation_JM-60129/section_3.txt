Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few spelling errors. For example, "potatow-noses" should be "potato-noses" maybe? And "on the contrarys" instead of "on the contrary". Also, "a younger brother steps into his elder brother's place, in case of the death of the latter, despite the difference of age, but if the marriage has already take place" – "take" should be "taken". These are minor but noticeable. The structure of sentences seems mostly okay, but some are quite long and complex, which might affect flow. However, the text is generally readable. So for Fluency, maybe a 4? Because there are some minor issues but overall it's well-structured.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect and the overall structure. The current segment jumps between different topics: physical characteristics, customs, marriage practices, festivals, language notes, statistics, and then a departure. Each subsection seems logical within itself, but the transitions between these topics could be smoother. For example, moving from marriage customs to the language table feels abrupt. Also, the statistics table comes out of nowhere without much introduction. The text assumes some background knowledge, like what Sarö Yögur and Shera Yögur are, but since it's part of a larger document, maybe that's okay. However, within this segment, the flow between sections isn't very connected. So Coherence might score a 3.5 because while each part is understandable, the overall flow is a bit disjointed with abrupt topic shifts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "potatow-noses" (typo: "potato-noses"), "on the contrarys" (should be "on the contrary"), "take" (should be "taken").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., brother inheritance rule).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., customs → language table → statistics).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between subsections (e.g., funeral rites to property inheritance).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
