Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section even though it's there for context. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I'll read through the current segment and note any issues. 

Looking at the text, the sentences generally seem well-structured. However, there are a few points where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "the chill air revived him and he sat up. He would not touch the damp coat or think any more than was possible, of the wound, and perhaps he might get on to Washington." The phrase "think any more than was possible" feels a bit clunky. Maybe "think more than necessary" would be smoother. Also, "the dampness and the pain made him faint" – "dampness" here might be better as "cold" or "wetness" since dampness usually refers to humidity, not blood. That's a minor point but could cause a slight pause.

Another spot: "If he should die there, who would ever bear the word to General Washington that he had faithfully performed his duty?" The structure here is formal and a bit archaic, which might fit the historical context but could affect fluency for modern readers. It's not an error, just stylistic.

In the dialogue, especially between Morley and Robert, the exchanges are mostly clear, but some sentences are long and complex. For instance, Morley's last requests are detailed and might feel a bit drawn out, but that's part of the emotional weight, so maybe not a fluency issue.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole section flows logically and connects ideas. The segment starts with Robert lost, then meets Morley, they fight, Morley dies, and Robert tries to reach Washington. The structure here is mostly logical, but there are transitions that could be smoother. For example, after Morley's death, the narrative jumps to Robert realizing his condition and hearing distant firing. The connection between Morley's death and Robert's decision to move could be clearer. Also, the introduction of "Debby Mason" and the messages feels a bit abrupt. The reader might wonder who Debby is without prior context, but since the current segment is part of a larger work, maybe that's established earlier. However, within this segment alone, it's introduced suddenly.

Another point: When Robert hears someone crying for help and finds Morley, the transition from Robert's thoughts to discovering Morley could be smoother. It feels a bit sudden, but given the context of them just fighting, it's somewhat expected.

In the final part with the surgeons, the conclusion that Robert is done for feels a bit rushed. The transition from him being found to the hospital scene is quick, but that's common in narratives for pacing.

For Fluency, the main issues are minor wording choices and a couple of awkward phrasings, but overall it's readable. So Fluency might score a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

For Coherence, the main issues are some abrupt transitions (like after Morley's death) and the introduction of new characters (Debby Mason) without immediate context within the segment. However, the overall narrative flow is logical, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but mostly coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "dampness" (could imply humidity rather than blood/wetness)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "think any more than was possible"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift after Morley’s death to Robert’s realization of his condition  
- [CLARITY] Sudden introduction of "Debby Mason" without contextual setup in the segment  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
