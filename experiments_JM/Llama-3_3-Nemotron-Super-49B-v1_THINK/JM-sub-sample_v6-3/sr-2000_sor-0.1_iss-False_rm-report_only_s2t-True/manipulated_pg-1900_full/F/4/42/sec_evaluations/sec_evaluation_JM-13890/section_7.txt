Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I need to evaluate the current segment based on fluency and coherence. The user provided a previous section, but I should ignore that. Let's start with fluency.

First, fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The current segment is a descriptive piece about a cathedral, its architecture, history, and various monuments. I'll read through it to spot any issues.

Looking at the text, the sentences are quite long and complex. For example, the first sentence: "All this barbarous crowding of colour and ornament, all this splendour of a ritual that appealed to an age capable of stilling the voice of conscience with an absolution obtainable for a few pence had passed away..." That's a mouthful. The structure is a bit convoluted with multiple clauses. Maybe that's a syntax issue? It's not wrong grammatically, but it's a bit hard to follow. So maybe [SYNTAX] for that.

Then there's a part about Prior Goldstone II adding an arch. The sentence says, "The arch has been called a disfigurement, and as it was not originally intended such an opinion may be justifiable..." Wait, the phrase "such an opinion may be justifiable" feels a bit awkward. Maybe a comma after "intended" would help, or rephrasing for clarity. That could be a [GRAMMAR] issue, perhaps a missing comma or awkward phrasing.

Further on, there's a description of the north-west transept being the scene of Becket's martyrdom. The sentence structure here seems okay, but there are a lot of details packed in without transitions. For example, moving from the undercroft steps to the south choir aisle and then to St. Michael's Chapel. The connections between these points might feel a bit abrupt. That could affect coherence, but since I'm on fluency now, maybe the transitions within sentences are okay, but the overall flow between ideas might be a coherence issue.

In the part about Archbishop Howley, the quote is set off with quotation marks, which is correct. The sentence about the carriage struggling through the mob is clear. No obvious fluency issues there.

Later, describing the choir's architecture: "The arcades of alternately circular and octagonal pillars have richly carved foliated capitals..." That's a bit of a tongue-twister, but grammatically correct. The word "alternately" might be intended to mean "alternating," which could be a [LEXICON] issue if "alternately" is misused. Wait, "alternately" means one after the other, whereas "alternating" might be more appropriate here. So that's a possible error in word choice.

Then, "the change to pure Early English is slight in comparison." The comparison here is a bit unclear. Slight compared to what? The previous sentence mentioned being far in advance of Norman work. Maybe the sentence could be clearer, but it's not a major fluency issue, just a minor clarity point.

In the Trinity Chapel section, the description of the tomb of the Black Prince has several complex sentences. For example: "All the details of this tomb had been arranged by the Black Prince himself, and it was he who chose the Norman-French inscription..." The "it was he" construction is a bit formal and less common nowadays, but grammatically correct. Not a major issue.

Now checking for spelling errors. The text mentions "CrÃ©cy" which should be "Crécy" with an accent, but maybe that's just encoding. Assuming it's a typo, that's a [SPELLING] error. Also, "latten" is an archaic term for a metallic alloy; while correct, it might be unfamiliar, but that's more [LEXICON] if it's considered obscure.

For coherence, the text jumps between different parts of the cathedral: from the arch by Prior Goldstone to the western screen, then to monuments in the aisles, the north-west transept, undercroft, various chapels, and back to the choir and Trinity Chapel. Each paragraph seems to focus on a different area, but the transitions between them could be smoother. For example, moving from the north aisle monuments to the north-west transept without a clear link. That's a [TRANSITION] issue.

The text also contrasts Archbishop Langton's actions with Archbishop Howley's, which is a logical contrast but feels a bit inserted without a clear connection to the surrounding architectural descriptions. That might be a [LOGIC] issue in coherence.

In the part about the Black Prince's tomb, the description is detailed but jumps between the tomb's features, the inscription, the canopy, and the funeral suits. While each point is relevant, the flow could be more organized. Maybe a [STRUCTURE] issue within that paragraph.

The final paragraph about the windows in Trinity Chapel seems to come out of nowhere after discussing the Black Prince's tomb. The transition could be better, another [TRANSITION] problem.

So summarizing fluency issues:
- Complex sentence structures ([SYNTAX])
- Possible missing punctuation or awkward phrasing ([GRAMMAR])
- Word choice issues like "alternately" ([LEXICON])
- Spelling error in "CrÃ©cy" ([SPELLING])

Coherence issues:
- Abrupt transitions between different locations ([TRANSITION])
- Inserted contrasts without clear connection ([LOGIC])
- Some paragraphs feel like lists of features without smooth flow ([STRUCTURE])

Now scoring. For fluency, despite some complex sentences and minor issues, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability much. So maybe a 4? But there are a few points, so perhaps 3.5? Wait, the scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues," 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues." Given the several syntax and lexicon points, maybe 3.5.

For coherence, the text has several abrupt transitions and some disconnected ideas, but the overall structure is generally followable. So maybe a 3, as it's "generally coherent but noticeable issues."

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., first sentence).  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "such an opinion may be justifiable").  
- [LEXICON] Misuse of "alternately" for "alternating"; archaic terms (e.g., "latten").  
- [SPELLING] Encoding error in "CrÃ©cy".  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural features (e.g., north aisle to transept).  
- [LOGIC] Contrasting archbishops feels disconnected from context.  
- [STRUCTURE] Paragraphs list details without cohesive flow (e.g., tomb descriptions).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
The text is rich in historical and architectural detail but suffers from dense, overly complex sentences and minor grammatical/phrasing issues, affecting fluency. Coherence is compromised by abrupt transitions and disjointed ideas, though the overall narrative remains generally followable.
