Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The context is given, but I shouldn't consider it for scoring. 

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text and look for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon issues. The text is from an older style, maybe 19th century, so some archaic language is expected. Let's check for errors. 

Looking at sentences like "We will went to this new land..." That's a clear grammatical error—"will went" should be "will go." That's a syntax issue. Also, "her strength goes from her" might be a bit awkward phrasing, but maybe acceptable in the context of the era. "Hearts throbs" should be "heart throbs" (subject-verb agreement). "Loving waiting hearts" is a bit unclear; maybe "loving hearts that waited"? Not sure if that's a major issue. 

For Coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically. The scene shifts from Debby's conversation with her mother to traveling, then to Jack Martin's visit, then to Doctor Bell's proposal. Each part seems connected, but there's a jump from the emotional reunion to the introduction of Doctor Bell. The transitions might be a bit abrupt, especially when Doctor Bell appears without much setup. Also, the part where Debby explains the chest contents feels a bit like a info dump, but it serves a purpose in character development. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are the grammatical errors like "will went" and "hearts throbs." These are noticeable but don't completely disrupt reading. Maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues. 

For Coherence, the transitions between scenes could be smoother, and some parts feel a bit rushed or disconnected. However, the overall narrative progresses logically. Maybe a score of 4 here too, as it's mostly coherent with a few weak connections.
