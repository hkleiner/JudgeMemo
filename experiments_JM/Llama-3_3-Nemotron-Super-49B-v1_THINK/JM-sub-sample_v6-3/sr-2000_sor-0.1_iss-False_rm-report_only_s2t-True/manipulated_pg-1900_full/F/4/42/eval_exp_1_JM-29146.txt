Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the overall Fluency and Coherence of the text based on the section-wise report. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at each section's Fluency scores: 
- Section 01: 3.0 (multiple grammar issues)
- Section 02: 4.5 (only one minor grammar error)
- Section 03: 3.5 (spelling, grammar, syntax issues)
- Section 04: 3.5 (spelling and grammar)
- Sections 05-10: Mostly 4.0, with some grammar, spelling, and syntax problems but less severe.

So, the first section has serious issues, but the rest improve. However, recurring problems like subject-verb agreement, tense inconsistencies, and some awkward phrasing appear across multiple sections. Even in higher-scoring sections (like 4.0), there are still errors, but they're minor. The worst part is section 01 with a 3.0, indicating noticeable issues. But overall, most sections are around 3.5 to 4.5. The average might be around 3.8 or so, but since the first section is a 3.0 and others have occasional errors, maybe a 4.0 overall? Wait, but the criteria for 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." Since some sections have more than minor (like section 01 and 03), but others are good. Hmm. Maybe 3.5? Because while many sections are 4.0, the presence of sections with 3.0 and 3.5 and recurring grammar errors across sections might bring it down. Let me check the scale again. Score 3: "Generally readable... multiple grammatical issues." Score 4: "mostly fluent, minor issues." Since the majority of sections are 3.5 or above, but there are sections with more significant problems, maybe 3.5 is right for Fluency.

Now Coherence. Section scores vary from 3.0 to 4.5. Issues include abrupt transitions, sudden introductions without setup, logical inconsistencies (like in section 09 where Irwadi's death contradicts the premise), and disconnected narrative threads. Sections 01, 03, 05-09 have 3.5 coherence, which is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." Sections 02 and 04 are 4.0, and section 10 is 4.0. The problems are frequent across sectionsâ€”almost every section has transition or structure issues. The highest issue is the logical contradiction in section 09, which is serious. So even though some sections are okay, the pervasive transition problems and some major logic issues would lower the score. The average might be around 3.7, but considering the consistent transition problems and a major logic error, maybe 3.0? Wait, the scale for 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable abrupt shifts." Given that most sections have coherence issues, but the text is still mostly followable, maybe 3.5? But section 09 has a major logic flaw. Hmm. Let me think. If most sections have coherence at 3.5, and there's a serious issue in one section, the overall might be 3.5. Because while there are problems, the narrative isn't completely incoherent. So Coherence: 3.5, Fluency: 3.5.
