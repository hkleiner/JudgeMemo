Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. For Fluency, I'm looking at grammar, syntax, spelling, etc., how smoothly the text reads. For Coherence, it's about how the ideas flow logically and connect.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from a literary work, so the writing style might be a bit archaic or descriptive. Scanning through, I notice some quotes and dialogue. In the dialogue, there are interruptions like "Who was Lord Holland, uncle Tony?" which are in parentheses. That's stylistic, so maybe not an issue. Then there's "should was extinguished" – wait, the text says "Should was _ex_tinguished." That seems like a typo. The correct word should be "extinguished." So that's a SPELLING error. Also, in the narrative part, phrases like "the secret of everything in the world that is beautiful, or true, or terrible, is hidden in the strings of my violin" – that's a bit long, but it's poetic. Maybe not a fluency issue unless it's confusing. 

Looking further, in Anthony Croft's backstory: "he had lost his eyesight" – that's clear. Then, "The school was the ordinary district school of that time; there were not enough scholars for what Cyse Higgins called a 'degraded' school." The quote is properly handled. Later, "he was hungry and ever hungrier for knowledge" – "ever hungrier" is a bit informal but acceptable in narrative. "One glimpse of clear light that woulded shine" – wait, "woulded" is incorrect. It should be "would shine." That's a GRAMMAR error. Also, "when he shoulded have been poring" – another "shoulded" instead of "should have." So multiple GRAMMAR issues here. 

For Coherence, the section starts with a poem quote, then a scene with Davy and uncle Tony, then shifts to Anthony's backstory. The transition from the present scene to the backstory might feel abrupt. The narrative jumps from the kitchen to Anthony's childhood without a clear connector. That could be a STRUCTURE issue under Coherence. Also, within the backstory, there are details about his hatred for school and love for music. These are connected but might feel a bit disjointed without transitional phrases. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are SPELLING (extinguished typo) and multiple GRAMMAR errors (woulded, shoulded). For Coherence, the abrupt transition to backstory and possibly some disjointed ideas in the narrative structure. 

Scoring Fluency: There are a few errors but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 4? But the errors are noticeable. Wait, the scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." The errors here are a bit more than minor, especially the repeated "shoulded" and "woulded." So maybe 3.5? Because it's generally readable but has some distracting errors.

Coherence: The transition is abrupt, and the ideas, while connected, have some jumps. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly coherent but has some weak parts. Or 3.5 if the structure is more problematic. Since the backstory is a clear part of the narrative but lacks a smooth transition, I'll go with 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "Should was _ex_tinguished" (typo: "extinguished")  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded shine" and "shoulded have been" (incorrect verb forms)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from present scene to Anthony Croft’s backstory without clear connector  
- [CLARITY] Some disjointed narrative shifts within backstory details  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
