Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few grammatical errors. For example, "may I went to work" should be "may I go to work." There's also "was an artist" which should be "be an artist." These are subject-verb agreement issues. Then, "the stove and boiler" might have a missing article, but that's minor. Also, "got kindling" instead of "get kindling." These errors are scattered but not overwhelming. The text mostly flows well, so Fluency is probably a 4, since there are minor issues but overall it's readable.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds logically. The current segment has several scenes: the protagonist leaving school for work, working at the print shop, moving to Chicago, the experience at Rand McNally, and then returning. Each part transitions fairly smoothly, but there are some abrupt jumps. For example, the switch from the print shop in Michigan to Chicago feels a bit sudden without much transition. Also, the introduction of Frank Bromley and the art studio could be smoother. The story has a clear progression overall, but some connections between sections are weak. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but generally logical flow.

Wait, but let me check again. The section starts with the school scene, then the job, then the move to Chicago, the job at Rand McNally, the return, and the second sojourn. Each part is connected to the overall narrative of the protagonist's journey to become an artist, but the transitions between these episodes could be better. For instance, moving from the print shop to meeting Bromley and then to Chicago might need clearer links. However, given it's a memoir-style narrative, some abruptness might be acceptable. Still, the main issue is the lack of smooth transitions between some scenes, so Coherence score would be 4, as the disruptions aren't major but noticeable.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense consistency (e.g., "may I went to work")  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "caednâ€™t")  
- [LEXICON] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "got kindling")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between scenes (e.g., Michigan to Chicago)  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness in narrative pacing  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
