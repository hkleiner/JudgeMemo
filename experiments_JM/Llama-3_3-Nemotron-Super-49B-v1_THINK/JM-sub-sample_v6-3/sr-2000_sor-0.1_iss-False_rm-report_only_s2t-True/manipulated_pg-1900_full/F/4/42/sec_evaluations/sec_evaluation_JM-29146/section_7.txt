Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Scanning through the current segment, I notice a few errors. For example, "what appeared to was a dense early morning fog" should be "what appeared to be..." That's a grammar error. Also, "Ramar Chind arrive" should be "arrived"â€”subject-verb agreement. There's "Youhad got" which is a typo, probably "You'd got". "excepted followed them" should be "except follow them" or similar. "gott" instead of "got". These are scattered but not overwhelming. The text mostly flows well, but these minor issues deduct from a perfect score. So Fluency might be a 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connections between ideas. The segment has multiple scenes: Margot's thoughts, the technicians working on the Dog Star, Ramar Chind's arrival, then the Enterprise's launch into hyper-space, and the pursuit by Dog Star. The transitions between these scenes might feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from the Enterprise's preparation to the Dog Star's crew without clear connectors. Also, some explanations about hyper-space feel like info dumps, disrupting the flow. However, each scene within itself is logical. The main issue is the abrupt shifts between different plot threads without smooth transitions. So Coherence might score a 3.5, as it's generally coherent but with noticeable transitions issues.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense ("arrive" instead of "arrived"), missing/preposition errors ("appeared to was"), typo ("Youhad"), subject-verb mismatch ("gott").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., Dog Star technicians to Enterprise launch), - [CLARITY] Overly technical hyper-space explanations disrupting narrative flow.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
