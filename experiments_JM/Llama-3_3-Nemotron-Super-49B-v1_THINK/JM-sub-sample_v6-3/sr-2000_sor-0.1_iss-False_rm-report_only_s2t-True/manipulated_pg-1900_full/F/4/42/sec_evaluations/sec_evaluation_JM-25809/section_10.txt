Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context except for understanding any referenced ideas.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems mostly well-written, but I notice some dialectical spellings like "t'ree", "dere", "cuddented". These are intentional for character dialogue, so maybe they don't count as errors unless they disrupt flow. The syntax is generally good, but there are a few awkward phrasings. For example, "the face was contorted out of all humanity" is a bit dramatic but clear. Punctuation looks correct. Maybe a minor issue with some sentence structures, but overall fluent. So Fluency might be a 4 or 4.5.

Now Coherence. The story flows logically: Bud decides to send Ches for help, the miners' rush to the scene, then the rescue plan. Transitions between scenes (like from Bud to the miners' party) are smooth. However, there's a part where Captain Hanrahan's dialogue about new pants feels a bit out of place amid the urgency, but it's a character moment. Also, the shift from the intense wagon ride to the captain's joke might slightly disrupt coherence, but it's minor. Overall, the narrative is clear and well-connected. Coherence score probably 4.5 or 5.

Wait, checking again: Are there any abrupt jumps? The transition from Ches falling to the miners reacting is handled well. The captain's plan explanation is clear. Maybe the only issue is the brief humorous exchange during the dangerous ride, but it's intentional for character. So Coherence might be 5.

Fluency: The dialect is consistent and doesn't hinder understanding. A few phrases like "the good Lord kept you from getting hurt" are a bit clich√©d but don't affect fluency. Maybe minor syntax in some lines, but not enough to drop below 4.5. So Fluency 4.5.

Coherence: All elements connect logically. The rescue effort is well-structured. No major gaps or confusing parts. Score 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Intentional dialect spellings (e.g., "t'ree," "dere") may slightly slow reading for some readers.  
   - [SYNTAX] Rarely awkward phrasing (e.g., "the face was contorted out of all humanity").  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Brief, tonally jarring humor ("new pants") during urgent scenes, though intentional for character depth.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
