Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the text, I notice a few things. There's a part where it says "we were then carrying a Gibson Girl hangover from the Gay Nineties and were but a few years removed from a time..." That sentence seems a bit long and convoluted. Maybe a syntax issue. Also, in the line "I had been asked to give the weekly a new typographic lay-out. When this was ready Mr. Collier suggested that I take the art editorship." The transition here feels a bit abrupt. It jumps from being asked to do a layout to being offered a position without much connection. That might be a transition issue under Fluency's phrasing category.

Checking for grammar or spelling mistakes. I see "you woulded be given" – that's a clear grammar error ("would" instead of "would be"). That's a big one. Also, "had cast off its pseudo-Benjamin Franklin dress" – "pseudo" might be a bit formal, but not necessarily an error. Maybe a lexicon choice issue, but not sure if it's a problem. The text mostly seems grammatically correct otherwise. Some sentences are long, but they're structured okay. So the main Fluency issues are the "woulded" error and some awkward sentence structures or transitions.

Now for Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas flow logically. The Current Segment has several chapters and topics. The transition from talking about Bradley's Book to then discussing the magazine world and Collier's seems a bit disjointed. For example, after the part about Bradley's business failure, it jumps to "CHAPTER: NEW FIELDS" without a clear link. The chapters might be separate sections, but within the evaluated segment, these abrupt chapter starts could disrupt coherence. Also, in the Collier's part, there's a mention of working on the Thanksgiving issue, then a quote from Royal Cortissoz, followed by comments on sales and then the backstory of joining Collier's. These sections might not flow perfectly, causing some confusion. However, each paragraph generally stays on topic, so it's not severely incoherent. The main issues are the chapter breaks causing abrupt shifts and maybe some minor transitions between paragraphs.

Scoring Fluency: There's a clear grammar error ("woulded") which is a significant issue. Some sentence structure and transition problems, but overall the text is readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are errors, they don't make it unreadable.

Coherence: The structure has chapter headings which might feel abrupt in this excerpt. The ideas within each chapter are mostly coherent, but the jumps between chapters (like from Bradley's failure to NEW FIELDS) could be smoother. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly coherent but has some noticeable shifts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("you woulded be given")  
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between sentences (e.g., layout request to art editorship offer)  
- [LEXICON] Occasionally formal or archaic vocabulary (e.g., "pseudo-Benjamin Franklin dress")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter transitions (e.g., "NEW FIELDS" to "THE MAGAZINE WORLD") without clear linking  
- [TRANSITION] Minor disconnects between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Collier’s Thanksgiving issue to hiring backstory)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
