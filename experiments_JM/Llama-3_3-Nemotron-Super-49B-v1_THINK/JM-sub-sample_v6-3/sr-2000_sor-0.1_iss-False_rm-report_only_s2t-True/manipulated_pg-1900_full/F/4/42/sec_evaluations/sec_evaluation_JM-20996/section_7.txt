Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section even though it's given for context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The first sentence: "He was then made to get on the carabao's back..." seems fine. Next, "...the driver was instructed to started for the post..." Oh, here's a problem. The correct verb form after "instructed to" should be the infinitive, so it should be "to start" instead of "started". That's a grammar error [GRAMMAR].

Further down: "Was uncertain but that some of the ladrones would learn..." The sentence structure here is a bit awkward. It starts with "Was uncertain" which is unusual. Typically, it might be rephrased as "We were uncertain that..." for clarity. That's a syntax issue [SYNTAX].

Another point: "...and not to stop until he get there." Again, subject-verb agreement. "He" is singular, so it should be "gets" instead of "get". Another [GRAMMAR] error.

In the sentence "A pack of dogs were heralding our approach..." The subject is "A pack of dogs", which is singular, so the verb should be "was" instead of "were". [GRAMMAR] error here.

Also, "ponies am procured" should be "were procured". [GRAMMAR] again.

For Fluency, these multiple grammar errors are notable. Even though the text is mostly readable, the frequent grammatical mistakes would deduct points. The scale says a 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues, but here the errors are a bit more than minor. Maybe a 3.5 because while you can understand it, the errors are distracting.

Now Coherence. The text describes a sequence of events: putting pedagogues in the cart, deciding to sleep with revolvers, waking up late, approaching a village. The flow seems logical, each paragraph connects to the next. However, the transition from sleeping to waking up with the sun past midday is smooth. Then introducing the pack of dogs heralding approach to the village where ponies are procured. The ideas are connected, but maybe the last sentence feels a bit abrupt. The village and procuring ponies might not be fully explained, but given it's a segment, maybe that's okay. The main issue might be slight abruptness in the last transition [TRANSITION], but overall coherence is good. Maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly coherent with a minor transition issue.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("instructed to started")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure ("Was uncertain but that...")  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors ("he get", "dogs were")  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("am procured")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Slightly abrupt shift to introducing the village and ponies  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
