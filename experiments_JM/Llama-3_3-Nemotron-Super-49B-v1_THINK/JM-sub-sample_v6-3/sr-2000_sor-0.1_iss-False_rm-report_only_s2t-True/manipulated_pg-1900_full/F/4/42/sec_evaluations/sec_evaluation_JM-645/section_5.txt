Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as given. The text provided is the Current Segment to Evaluate, and I shouldn't consider the Previous Section.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Let me read through the current segment carefully.

Looking at the text, there are a few spots where grammar or wording seems off. For example, "he had am free with me in a mood" should probably be "he had been free" or similar. Then "This general levity help me to believe" – "help" should be "helped". Also, "the reason of his note" might be better as "the reason for his note". Further on, "We had begin by disputing" should be "We began". "Woulded put it back" is clearly a typo for "would put". "Very hard, very long, very strangely" might be a bit awkward but not a major error. "She must played fair" should be "She must play fair". 

These are grammatical and spelling issues. So under Fluency, the main problems are GRAMMAR and SPELLING errors. Even though they are present, the text is mostly readable. So the Fluency score would be around 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now for Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas connect logically and flow smoothly. The current segment talks about the narrator's interactions with Corvick and Gwendolen, their pursuit of Vereker's secret, and the narrator's feelings. The structure seems to follow a logical sequence: discussing Corvick's approach, the narrator's visits, Corvick's methods, and the contrast between the narrator's frustration and Corvick's dedication. 

However, there might be some transitions that feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from describing Corvick's methodical approach to the chessplayer analogy might need smoother transitions. Also, the shift from discussing Gwendolen's character to the narrator's envy and then to Corvick's defense of his approach could be clearer. But overall, the narrative stays focused on the central theme of uncovering Vereker's secret and the characters' interactions around it. 

So Coherence issues might be minor, like some unclear transitions or slight shifts in focus, but not major. Hence, Coherence score would be around 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he had am free" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "woulded" (typo for "would")  
- [GRAMMAR] "We had begin" (tense inconsistency)  
- [SPELLING] "must played" (verb tense error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from chess analogy to narrator’s envy (lacks explicit connector)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrase "sharpness of a sense that Corvick would at last probably come out somewhere" (requires inference)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
