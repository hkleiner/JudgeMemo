Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to evaluate the current segment for Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., ensuring smooth flow. The text is from an older style, so some archaic language might be expected, but I need to check for actual errors.

Looking through the current segment, I notice a few things. In the sentence "She was so anxious to get where she could see everything to the best advantage that she crowd too near the bier..." there's "crowd" which should be "crowded". That's a spelling/grammar error. Also, "weigh" instead of "weighed" in "She weigh over two hundred pounds". Those are clear errors affecting fluency.

There's also some complex sentence structures, like the long narrative about Lyddy's past. While complex, they seem grammatically correct, just dense. The use of dialect in quotes like "I’d ’a’ be’n" might affect readability for some, but it's intentional for character voice, so maybe not a fluency issue unless it's overly confusing. The text mostly flows well despite some lengthiness. So Fluency score might be around 4, deducting for the two errors but overall well-structured.

Now Coherence. It's about the logical flow of ideas, connections, and structure. The current segment starts with Aunt Hitty's funeral planning, then shifts to Lyddy inheriting the house, her backstory, and her life as a recluse. The transition from the funeral details to Lyddy's introduction seems a bit abrupt. The story jumps from Aunt Hitty's comments to Lyddy's history without a clear connector. Also, the chapter title with the Emerson quote feels disconnected without explanation. However, within each section, the ideas are logically sequenced. The main issue is the transition between parts and some disjointedness, but overall it's mostly coherent. So Coherence score might be 3.5, as there are noticeable shifts but the whole isn't too hard to follow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "crowd" instead of "crowded" in "she crowd too near the bier"  
- [SPELLING] "weigh" instead of "weighed" in "She weigh over two hundred pounds"  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., Lyddy’s backstory narration)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Aunt Hitty’s funeral planning to Lyddy’s introduction/backstory  
- [STRUCTURE] Chapter IV quote ("EMERSON’S _Merlin_") feels disconnected without contextual framing  
- [LOGIC] Minor disjointedness between Edgewood community commentary and Lyddy’s character development  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
