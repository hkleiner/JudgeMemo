Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence on a Likert scale with half-points.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the current segment, I notice a few issues. There's a typo in "man" instead of "manned" in the first sentence. That's a clear spelling/grammar error. Then, "had been man" should be "had been manned". Another spot: "avoid" should be "avoided" in "Temporarily, at least, street fighting within Petersburg had been avoid." That's a subject-verb agreement mistake. Also, "discover" instead of "discovered" in "It was discover at 3 a.m..." is a verb tense error. These are specific points under [SPELLING] and [GRAMMAR]. 

For Coherence, the text seems mostly logical, but there's a jump from talking about the defense and the inner line to suddenly mentioning street fighting being avoided. The transition there feels a bit abrupt. Also, when it shifts to Grant's pursuit and then to the casualties, the connections between paragraphs could be smoother. There's a mention of "the object" without clear reference, which might confuse readers. These are [TRANSITION] and [CLARITY] issues.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the errors, the text is generally readable. The mistakes are noticeable but don't completely disrupt flow. So maybe a 4? Wait, the errors are a bit more than minor. Let me check the scale. Score 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." But here, there are a few errors. Maybe 3.5? Because it's generally readable but has multiple grammatical/spelling issues.

For Coherence, the main issues are transitions and some unclear references. The narrative mostly follows logically, but there are noticeable shifts. So a 4 might be too high. Looking at the scale, Score 3 is "generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts." That fits. So Coherence would be 3.5? Wait, the transitions are a problem, and the "object" reference is unclear. Maybe 3.5 is right because while it's mostly coherent, the issues affect the reading experience.

Wait, let me recheck. The Fluency errors: "man" instead of "manned", "avoid" instead of "avoided", "discover" instead of "discovered". These are three clear errors. The scale says Score 3 is "generally readable with multiple issues." So maybe Fluency is 3.5? Because it's readable but has several errors. Coherence has transition issues and unclear references, so 3.5 as well?

Alternatively, Fluency might be 3.5 because the errors are present but don't make it hard to understand. Coherence, the transitions are problematic but the overall structure is there, so maybe 3.5 for Coherence too. Hmm. Need to balance. Let's finalize: Fluency 3.5 due to multiple grammar/spelling errors but overall readability. Coherence 3.5 because of transition problems and some clarity issues but the narrative holds mostly together.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "man" instead of "manned" in "had been man."  
- [GRAMMAR] "avoid" (verb tense error) in "had been avoid."  
- [SPELLING] "discover" instead of "discovered."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from defense to "street fighting... avoid."  
- [CLARITY] Unclear antecedent for "the object" in "The object was to delay..."  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
