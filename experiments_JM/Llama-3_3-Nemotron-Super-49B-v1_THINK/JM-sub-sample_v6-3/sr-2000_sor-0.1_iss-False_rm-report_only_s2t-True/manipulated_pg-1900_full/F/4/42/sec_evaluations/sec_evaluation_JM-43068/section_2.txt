Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability. Let me read through the current segment carefully.

Looking for errors: In the sentence "the duty which would had left unaffected a less observant nature..." – "would had" seems incorrect; should be "would have". That's a grammar error [GRAMMAR]. Another spot: "the period when all the earth after its long winter sleep is about to waken into new life seems to had always been a source of inspiration..." – "seems to had" should be "seems to have". Another [GRAMMAR] issue. 

Also, some sentence structures are complex and long, which might make fluency slightly lower, but since the errors are few and the overall flow is good despite the formal tone, maybe a 4? But wait, there are two clear grammatical errors. The scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues". These errors are minor but noticeable. So Fluency score might be 4.

Now Coherence. The text discusses Millet's art characteristics, his approach when not in a sad mood, examples like "La Baigneuse" and "The Sheep Pen", then transitions to his themes and philosophy, followed by a section on his early life. Wait, the last part starts "CHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" which seems like a new chapter. But the user said to evaluate the current segment on its own. However, the transition from discussing his art to his early life might feel abrupt. Is that within the current segment? Let me check.

The current segment includes "...weigh his merits." followed by "CHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" and then the text about his birth. So within the current segment, there's a chapter heading and then a new topic. That could be an abrupt transition [STRUCTURE], disrupting coherence. Also, the part before the chapter talks about his artistic philosophy, and then suddenly his birth and the state of French art. That's a significant shift without clear connection. So Coherence issue here. 

Other parts seem logically connected – the examples support the points about his style. So the main coherence issue is the abrupt transition to the early life chapter without a link. Hence, Coherence score might be 4 because mostly coherent but with a noticeable disconnect.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense ("would had" instead of "would have")  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("seems to had" instead of "seems to have")  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "to-morrow," "ménage") may impede modern readability  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to "MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" chapter without contextual bridge  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit link between artistic philosophy and biographical/historical context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
