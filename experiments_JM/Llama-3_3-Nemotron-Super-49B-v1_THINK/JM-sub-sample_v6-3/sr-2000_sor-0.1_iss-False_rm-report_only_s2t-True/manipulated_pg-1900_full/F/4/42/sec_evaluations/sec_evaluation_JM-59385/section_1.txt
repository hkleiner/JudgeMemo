Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence metrics separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but I noticed a few grammatical errors. For example, "the shadows was long" should be "were long". There's also "the chair-bearers mighted carry" which should be "might carry". These are grammatical mistakes. Then, "ventured up through the paved stones were worn away" seems a bit awkward in phrasing. Also, "the hour grew on" is an unusual expression; maybe "as time passed" would be better. "When she could went no farther" should be "couldn't go any farther". These issues are minor but noticeable. The text is generally fluent, so maybe a 4?

Now Coherence. The narrative flows logically, describing the scene step by step. However, there's a sudden shift when Kuei Ping remembers her graduation day. The transition feels abrupt without a clear connection to the preceding context. The memory flashback isn't smoothly integrated, disrupting the flow a bit. Otherwise, the ideas are well-connected. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, but the abrupt transition deducts a point, making it 3.5?

Wait, the Coherence scale says 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. The flashback is a notable disruption, so maybe 3.5 is right. For Fluency, despite the errors, they don't disrupt much, so 4.0.

Double-checking the criteria: Fluency 4 allows minor issues not disrupting readability. The errors here are minor. Coherence 3.5 has noticeable shifts. Yes, that fits.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("the shadows was long")  
   - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("ventured up through the paved stones were worn away")  
   - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("mighted carry")  
   - [LEXICON] Unusual expression ("the hour grew on")  
   - [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("when she could went no farther")  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt, unmarked shift to flashback memory (graduation day) without contextual bridge  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
