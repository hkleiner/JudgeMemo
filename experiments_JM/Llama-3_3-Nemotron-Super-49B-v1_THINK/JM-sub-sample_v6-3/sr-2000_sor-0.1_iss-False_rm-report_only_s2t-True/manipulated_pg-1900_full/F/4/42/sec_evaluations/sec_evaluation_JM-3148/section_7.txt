Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a narrative passage with dialogue. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues.

Looking through the text, the sentences seem well-structured. There are some long sentences, but they're properly punctuated. For example, "She drew nearer, in spite of her dread of meeting people, or above all of intruding, and saw Anthony Croft..." uses commas correctly. The dialogue tags are handled well, like "“Good-morning, Mr. Croft,”" with proper quotation marks and capitalization.

Wait, there's a part where Lyddy says, "“You seem to have had an accident; what can I do to help you?” she asked." The semicolon before the question might be a bit formal, but it's grammatically correct. No obvious spelling mistakes noticed. Maybe some minor issues with word choice? Like "traipsing" for the turkey's behavior—though that's more style than an error. 

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas flow and connect. The scene transitions from Lyddy searching for her turkey to encountering Anthony Croft's situation. The narrative moves logically: she hears the crash, investigates, discovers he's blind, they interact, and she offers help. The dialogue between Lyddy and Anthony flows naturally, revealing their characters and the situation. 

However, there's a quote from Emerson's "Saadi" inserted before the hen turkey paragraph. That might disrupt the flow slightly if not contextualized, but since it's presented as a chapter heading or quote, it's probably intentional. The transition from the poetic quote to the mundane scenario with the hen might feel abrupt, but in literary contexts, such contrasts are common. 

Another point: When Lyddy reflects on not being looked at because Anthony is blind, it's a clear connection to her past experiences. The narrative explains her feelings coherently, showing her emotional shift. The only potential issue is if the shift from her reveries at home to chasing the turkey feels a bit abrupt, but given the chapter structure, it's manageable.

So for Fluency, maybe a minor deduction for some complex sentences, but overall fluent. Coherence is strong, with logical progression and clear connections, except perhaps the quote's placement. But since it's labeled as a chapter quote, it's acceptable. 

Fluency Score: 4.5 (mostly fluent, minor complexities but no errors)
Coherence Score: 4 (mostly coherent, slight abruptness with the quote but minor)

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from poetic quote to narrative might feel slightly disjointed without broader context.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
