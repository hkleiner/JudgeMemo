Okay, let me start by reading through the given text carefully. The task is to evaluate the Fluency and Coherence of the "Current Section" provided, which is Chapter One and the beginning of Chapter Two of "The Feast of St. Friend."

First, for Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic style, which might affect readability but isn't necessarily an error. I need to check for any actual grammatical or spelling mistakes. 

Looking through the text, there's a sentence: "the reindeer are still tramped the sky" – should be "tread" instead of "tramped." That's a spelling/lexical error. Also, "the peculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a vacation, may be clearly see by contrasting..." – "see" should be "seen." Another error. 

There's a part where it says "They was terrific Tories..." – subject-verb agreement error; should be "They were..." Also, "the common sense of the western hemisphere will not disputed" – missing "be" before "disputed." These are definite grammar issues. 

The text uses complex sentences and old-fashioned vocabulary (e.g., "thenceforward," "consciously," "disconcerting"), but that's style, not an error. However, the frequent errors like "tramped," "see," "was," and "disputed" without "be" would deduct from fluency. Since these are noticeable but don't completely disrupt reading, maybe a Fluency score of 3.5? Because there are multiple errors but the text is mostly readable.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas are connected, logical flow, transitions. The text starts by contrasting past and present Christmas experiences, then discusses how children keep the spirit alive, and the author's point about the loss of magic. It transitions into Chapter Two by arguing that the decadence isn't just subjective. 

The structure seems logical, with each paragraph building on the previous idea. However, there might be some abrupt shifts, like moving from personal memories to general statements about adults and children. For example, the transition from the brother's organ playing to the general change in attitude feels a bit abrupt. Also, the sentence "If any person here breaks in..." feels like a sudden address to the reader, which might disrupt flow slightly. 

In Chapter Two, the argument about adults not inventing things for children is well-supported with the pantomime example, but the transition to the harlequinade and children being Tories might feel a bit forced. The conclusion about old hymns as proof could be more clearly connected. However, overall, the text is generally coherent with some minor disconnects. So Coherence might score around 4, as it's mostly coherent with a few weak points.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("They was terrific Tories")  
- [SPELLING/LEXICON] "tramped" instead of "tread"; "see" instead of "seen"; "disputed" missing "be"  
- [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "the peculiarity... may be clearly see")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from personal anecdote to general societal critique  
- [STRUCTURE] Slightly forced connection between pantomime example and "Tories" metaphor  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, archaic rhetoric may obscure intent for modern readers  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
