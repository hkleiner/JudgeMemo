Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The user mentioned not to consider the previous section, so I'll ignore that.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text seems mostly well-structured. However, there are a few spots. For example, "am begun" should be "had begun" – that's a tense inconsistency. Also, "was immobilizing" might be a bit awkward, but not too bad. "held" in "attack, occupy, and held" should be "hold" for subject-verb agreement. A couple of minor errors here and there, like "the march to the sea followed in 10 weeks" could be phrased better for clarity, but it's understandable. These are minor issues, so Fluency might be a 4, since they're noticeable but don't disrupt much.

Now Coherence. The text switches between different events and battles. There's a clear structure with each chapter heading, but sometimes transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. For instance, moving from the Weldon Railroad to the Battle of Peebles’ Farm feels a bit abrupt without a connecting sentence. Also, the timeline jumps around (July 30, August, September, October) which might confuse without the context of the previous chapters. However, each section within itself is logical. The use of transitional phrases like "Meanwhile" and "Then" helps, but there are spots where the flow could be better. Coherence score might be a 4 as well, since the overall structure is there but with some minor disconnects.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("am begun" instead of "had begun")  
   - [SPELLING] Minor typo ("weaken" instead of "weakened")  
   - [SYNTAX] Repetitive phrasing ("the Union army had lost...", repeated structure in casualty reports)  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Weldon Railroad to Peebles’ Farm without bridging sentence)  
   - [CLARITY] Overly dense timeline jumps (July, August, September) without explicit chronological connectors  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
