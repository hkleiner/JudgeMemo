Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat formal, old-fashioned style, which might affect readability. Let me read through and note any grammar, syntax, spelling, or phrasing issues. The first thing I notice is the use of complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, "Fragonard, now thirty-seven, married Marie Anne Gérard in her eighteenth year; and she bore him a much loved daughter, Rosalie—and ten years later, in 1780, a son, Alexandre Evariste Fragonard." That's a long sentence but grammatically correct. However, some phrases like "fell a-painting" might be archaic ("began to paint") but not incorrect. There's also "the rough accent of Provence" which is a bit unclear—does it mean she had a Provencal accent? Maybe a minor clarity issue. 

Checking for grammar errors: "he was too keen an artist, his was too original a genius" – "his" here should probably be "he was" for consistency. That's a grammatical error. Also, "the figure of a man, known as 'Figure de Fantaisie' or 'Inspiration,' is stated with a directness and vividness worthy of the great Dutch master." The comma after 'Inspiration' is correctly used, so no issue there. 

Spelling seems okay, no obvious typos. Phrasing is mostly smooth, though some sentences are dense. For example, "He brought to his homeliest pictures a beauty of arrangement, a sense of style, and a dignity worthy of the most majestic subjects." That's a bit wordy but clear. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are a couple of grammatical errors (like "his was") and some archaic phrasing that might cause slight confusion but doesn't disrupt flow much. Overall, it's mostly fluent but with minor issues, so maybe a 4?

Now Coherence. The section seems to follow Fragonard's life after the Du Barry rejection. It talks about his marriage, family, artistic influences, and specific works. The structure moves from his personal life to artistic changes and influences. Are there any abrupt shifts or unclear connections? The transition from describing his family to discussing Dutch influences seems logical. However, the part about Boucher "going about like a shadow of himself" feels a bit tacked on without clear connection to the rest. Maybe a minor transition issue there. 

Also, the paragraph about the Du Barry's bills and Fragonard's absence in them connects back to her rejecting his work, which is clear. The narrative flows logically, each paragraph building on the previous. No major inconsistencies or jumps. So Coherence is strong, maybe a 5, but the Boucher sentence might be a slight lapse, so 4.5?

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect pronoun usage ("his was" instead of "he was").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing (e.g., "fell a-painting," "rough accent of Provence").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt mention of Boucher’s decline without contextual connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
