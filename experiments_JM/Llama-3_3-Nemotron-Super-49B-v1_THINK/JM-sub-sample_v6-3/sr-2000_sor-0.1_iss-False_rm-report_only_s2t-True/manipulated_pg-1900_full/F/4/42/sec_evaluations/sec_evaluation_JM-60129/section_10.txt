Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at the text, the writing seems mostly smooth. The sentences are long but structured. I notice a few potential issues. For example, "imbedded" should be "embedded"—that's a spelling error. Then, "reined iu my horse" probably has a typo; "reined in" is correct, and "iu" might be "in". Also, "t'umu's adopted daughter" introduces a term without explanation, but since the context might be in the previous section (which we're not evaluating), maybe that's okay. The phrase "qui n'obligent à rien et qui font toujours plaisir" is in French without translation, which could affect readability for some readers. 

For Coherence, the text describes a journey from leaving the Shera Yögurs to arriving at Li-yen. The narrative moves geographically, describing landscapes and then the town. However, there's a shift from the travel description to the details about Potanin's visit twenty years ago and the mandarin's reception. These parts seem connected because they're about Li-yen, but the transition between the landscape and the historical/experiential details might feel a bit abrupt. Also, mentioning Potanin again without context (though the previous section might have it) could cause slight confusion. The structure is mostly logical, but some transitions could be smoother.

So for Fluency, the main issues are spelling errors and possibly some lexical choices or untranslated phrases. For Coherence, the main issue is a slight abruptness in transitioning between descriptive sections and historical/personal anecdotes. 

Fluency score: Considering the errors are minor but present, maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has noticeable minor issues.

Coherence score: The text is mostly coherent, but the transitions between ideas could be better. Maybe a 4 as well, since the overall structure is logical but has a few weak points.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "imbedded" (should be "embedded"), "iu" (likely typo for "in")  
- [LEXICON] Untranslated French phrase without context  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from geographic description to historical/experiential details (e.g., Potanin reference, mandarin’s reception)  
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of "t'umu" and "Dungan revolt" without explanation in this segment  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
