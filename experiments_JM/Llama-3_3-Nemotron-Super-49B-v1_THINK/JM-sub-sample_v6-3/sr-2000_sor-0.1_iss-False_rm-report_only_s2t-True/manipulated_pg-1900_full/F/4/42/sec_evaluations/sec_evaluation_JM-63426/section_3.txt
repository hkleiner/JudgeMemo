Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is written in a somewhat antiquated style, which might affect readability. I notice some sentence structures are a bit complex or old-fashioned, like "You, in turn, are adorned with the side-whiskers..." That's a bit awkward but not a major error. There's also "the shoddy that had once proved so disastrous in your pants now probably averts a serious accident." The word "shoddy" here might be unclear to modern readers; maybe it refers to cheap material? That could be a lexicon issue. Also, "You marvel at the skill..." is fine, but some phrases like "hand-jogging and cutting of these slippery and flimsy sheets" use terms that might be less common now, but they're explained in context. 

Looking for grammar or spelling mistakes. I see "the next morning you was seated" – that's a subject-verb agreement error ("you were"). Also, "A man, trained in Germany, grinds ink..." is a bit abrupt, but it's a comma splice maybe? Not sure if that's a major issue. The text mostly flows okay despite some archaic language. So Fluency might be around 4, considering some minor issues but overall clear.

Now Coherence. The segment jumps between different events: visiting the boss, working at K&L, meeting various people, buying a press, and encountering Fred Goudy. Each paragraph seems to introduce a new scene without strong transitions. For example, after the boss's house, it shifts to working at Knight & Leonard without a clear link. Then there's a jump to two years later, marrying, and then various artists and finally the encounter with Goudy. The events are loosely chronological but lack smooth connections. Some parts feel like separate anecdotes. However, the overall narrative is mostly followable, so Coherence might be a 3.5 or 4. Wait, but the shifts are quite abrupt. Maybe 3.5 because while you can understand each part, the transitions are weak.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic terms (e.g., "shoddy," "hand-jogging") may hinder modern readability.  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("you was seated").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, outdated sentence structures (e.g., "You, in turn, are adorned...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt scene shifts (e.g., from boss’s house to workplace, to historical printing details) without clear connectors.  
- [STRUCTURE] Episodic, loosely connected anecdotes (e.g., Goudy introduction feels tangential to preceding narrative).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
