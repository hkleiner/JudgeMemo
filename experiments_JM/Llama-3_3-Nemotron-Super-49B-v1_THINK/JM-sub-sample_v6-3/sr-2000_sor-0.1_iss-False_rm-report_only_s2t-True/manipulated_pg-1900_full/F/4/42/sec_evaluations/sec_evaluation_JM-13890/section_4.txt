Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems well-written overall, but I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through, I notice a few potential issues. For example, "had sought an excuse" should be "had come seeking an excuse" maybe? Wait, the original says "to sought"—that's a mistake. "Sought" is past participle; should be "to seek". That's a grammar error. Also, "Roger have been" instead of "had been"—subject-verb agreement issue. Another spot: "the wearing of a shirt only with a cloak to kept off the rain"—should be "to keep". Small errors but they exist.

For Coherence, the narrative flows logically from Becket's defiance to the murder, then the aftermath and canonization, King Henry's penance. However, there are some transitions that might feel abrupt. For example, moving from the murder scene to the monks discovering the hair shirt feels a bit sudden. Also, the part about Roger purloining the relic and becoming Abbot might not be fully connected to the surrounding context without more transition. The structure is mostly clear, but some sections jump between events without smooth connections.

So for Fluency, despite the text being mostly fluent, those grammatical errors deduct points. Maybe a 4? Because they are minor but present.

For Coherence, the main issues are some abrupt transitions and possibly too many detailed examples (like the relic theft) that disrupt the flow. But overall, the story progresses logically. Maybe a 4 as well, since the coherence is mostly there but with some weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "to sought" (should be "to seek")  
- [SPELLING/Grammar] "Roger have been" (subject-verb inconsistency)  
- [LEXICON] "kept off the rain" (awkward phrasing; "keep" implied)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from murder to monks’ discovery of Becket’s ascetic garments  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential detail about Roger’s relic theft disrupts narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
