Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text seems mostly well-structured, but I notice some sentence structures that are a bit long or wordy. For example, "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps of the first three years of the War, maps which speak only of two principal fronts, the French and the Russian, and no other--to grasp the significance of the gigantic role played in this War by great Russia and the millions of sacrifices she consecrated to the common cause of the Allies." That's a long sentence with multiple clauses. Also, there's a possible typo in "It may was easily seen" which should be "It may easily be seen." Another point is the use of "sonov" at the end of a paragraph, which might be a typo for "war." These are minor issues but enough to deduct from a perfect score. So Fluency would be a 4, as it's mostly fluent but with some minor problems.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connection between ideas. The text discusses the Russian role in the war, critiques Ludendorff's memoirs, and connects the Russian actions to the outcome at Marne. The structure seems logical, moving from explaining the strategic importance to debunking Ludendorff's claims. However, there are transitions that could be smoother. For instance, the shift from talking about Russia's role to specifically addressing Ludendorff's memoirs might benefit from a clearer connector. Also, some paragraphs feel a bit repetitive in emphasizing Russia's contribution, but overall the narrative holds together. The main points are well-connected, so Coherence would be a 4 as well, mostly coherent with minor weaknesses in transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., long convoluted sentences with multiple clauses).  
   - [SPELLING] Potential typo ("sonov" instead of "war").  
   - [LEXICON] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "It may was easily seen").  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift between critiquing Ludendorff and reiterating Russia’s role.  
   - [REPEAT] Mild redundancy in emphasizing Russia’s strategic impact.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
