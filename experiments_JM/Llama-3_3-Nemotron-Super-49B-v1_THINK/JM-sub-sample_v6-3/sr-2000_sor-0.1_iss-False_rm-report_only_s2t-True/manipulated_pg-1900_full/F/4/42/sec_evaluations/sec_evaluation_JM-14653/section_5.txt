Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text here seems mostly well-written, but I need to check for any errors. Scanning through, I notice a few possible issues. For example, "why shoulded you breathe a word" – "shoulded" isn't correct; it should be "should you". Then there's "people such as us, who was only just beginning" – subject-verb agreement error, should be "were". Also, "children was no match for them" should be "were". These are grammar mistakes. There's also a sentence structure in "And the comforting thought was that very probably..." which feels a bit abrupt, maybe a transition issue, but not sure if it's a fluency problem or coherence. 

For Coherence, the text needs to have logical flow and connected ideas. The current segment starts by discussing not forming societies, then moves to cultivating goodwill personally, choosing a specific person, and then transitions into a chapter about children and goodwill. The jump to "CHAPTER: SEVEN - THE GIFT OF ONESELF" might be a bit sudden, but since it's a chapter title, maybe that's expected. However, within the chapter, the discussion about children judging adults and the method of imagining oneself as others seems to follow logically from the previous advice on focusing on one person. But there's a shift from the individual approach to a more general discussion on children's perceptions and then back to a method. I need to check if the transitions between these ideas are smooth. The part where it says "I now come to the actual method of cultivating goodwill" followed by a new chapter might disrupt coherence slightly, as it introduces a new topic (children's views) before explaining the method. Also, some paragraphs might be a bit long or meandering, affecting coherence.

So for Fluency, the main issues are the grammatical errors like "shoulded", "was" instead of "were", and maybe some slightly awkward phrasing, but overall the text is readable. These are minor but noticeable, so maybe a 4 for Fluency since it's mostly fluent with some minor issues.

For Coherence, the structure within the current segment has some shifts. The transition into the new chapter and the discussion about children might feel a bit disconnected from the preceding advice on personal cultivation. However, the ideas do connect in promoting goodwill through personal effort and empathy. The coherence is mostly there but with some minor disruptions, so maybe a 4 as well. But wait, the transition to the chapter on children might be a bit abrupt without clear connection to the previous part. If the chapter is part of a larger work, it might make sense, but standalone, it could be seen as less coherent. So perhaps a 3.5 for Coherence because while the internal logic is there, the section jumps between topics slightly.

Wait, the evaluation is based on the current segment alone. The chapter title is part of the current segment. So the text starts with arguing against societies, then personal cultivation, then a new chapter discussing children's perspective and method. The link between personal cultivation and the child's view might not be immediately clear, leading to a coherence issue. So maybe Coherence gets a 3.5 due to the abrupt chapter start and topic shift.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded" (incorrect verb conjugation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "people such as us, who was" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "children was" (subject-verb agreement error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to "CHAPTER: SEVEN" without contextual bridge  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from personal cultivation advice to discussing children’s judgment  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
