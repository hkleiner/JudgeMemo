Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. For Fluency, I'm looking at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Coherence is about how the ideas flow logically and connect well.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are some errors. For example, "what she had left of material things woulded last" should be "would last"—that's a grammar mistake. Also, "he have loved" instead of "had loved" is another error. These are minor but noticeable. The sentence structure is generally good, but some sentences are a bit long and could be clearer. So Fluency might be a 4 because there are minor issues but overall it's smooth.

Now Coherence. The story follows Kuei Ping's journey from desperation to finding peace through her religious reflection. The sections transition okay, but there's a part where she decides to leave, then suddenly she's back home feeling joyful. The shift from wanting to escape to finding inner peace might feel a bit abrupt. Also, the poem-like sections ("Wherein...") might disrupt the flow slightly for some readers. However, the overall narrative is logical, so Coherence is probably a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but mostly coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (incorrect verb form; should be "would")  
- [SPELLING] "happend" (typo; should be "happened")  
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., "She saw...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Kuei Ping’s departure plan to her return home without clear resolution.  
- [TRANSITION] Poetic interludes ("Wherein...") disrupt narrative flow slightly.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
