Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability. I notice some grammatical issues. For example, "the multitude did not returned" should be "did not return." There's also "whom I think to appreciate" which sounds a bit off; maybe "whom I think is an acquired taste" would be better. Also, "he was early taught to loved De Quincey" should be "taught to love." These are grammatical errors that disrupt the flow a bit. The sentence structure is mostly complex and varied, but some sentences are very long and convoluted, like the one about De Quincey's writings. The vocabulary is rich but sometimes archaic, which might make it less fluent for modern readers. However, overall, the text is mostly readable despite these issues. So for Fluency, I'd say it's a 4 because there are minor issues but the text is mostly fluent.

Now Coherence. The text discusses the bookman's preferences and contrasts lasting literature with popular works. The structure meanders a bit, jumping between different authors and topics like essays, diaries, and classics. There are transitions, but they feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from talking about Sainte-Beuve's quote to discussing the bookman's collection of specific books might feel disconnected without clear links. The main idea about distinguishing between transient and immortal books is clear, but the examples and asides (like the comment on De Quincey's volumes or the preference for certain editions) might make the flow less smooth. However, the overall theme is maintained throughout. So Coherence would be a 4 as well because while there are some weak connections, the text remains mostly coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the multitude did not returned" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "he was early taught to loved De Quincey")  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary/phrasing (e.g., "gay world," "sinewy English style")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between literary references (e.g., shifting from _Mark Rutherford_ to Sainte-Beuveâ€™s quote without clear linkage)  
- [CLARITY] Tangential asides (e.g., details about book editions, personal preferences) slightly disrupt thematic focus  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
