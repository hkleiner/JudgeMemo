Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense and filled with complex philosophical and scientific concepts. The sentences are long and convoluted, which might affect readability. I notice some grammatical issues, like "We take them as they was given" (should be "were"), and "the mode of statement savours of ambiguity" (maybe "savors" but not a major error). Also, repeated uses of phrases like "so far as" or "in a sense" could be seen as slightly awkward but common in academic writing. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate, but the structure of sentences is complicated, which might make fluency a 4 because while there are minor issues, the text is mostly clear despite the complexity.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between discussing physiological processes, heredity, gravitative knowledge, and cognition. There are transitions like "Before passing on to indicate..." and "We pass, then, to cognition..." which help, but the connections between paragraphs might feel a bit abrupt. For example, the shift from the earth's motion to biological knowledge and then to cognitive processes might not be fully smooth. However, each section within itself is logically structured. The author uses examples (billiard ball, earth's orbit) to illustrate points, which aids coherence. The main issue is the broad scope of topics covered without very tight linking, leading to a coherence score of 4 as well, since the overall structure is mostly logical but with some weak connections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "In virtue of its 'inheritance from the past', it would continue at uniform velocity in one direction.")  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "was given" instead of "were given")  
- [LEXICON] Repetitive transitional phrases ("so far as," "in a sense")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between physiological, gravitational, and cognitive concepts without explicit linking.  
- [CLARITY] Overly broad scope of topics (e.g., earthâ€™s motion to plant awareness) with vague transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about "cognition" and "awareness" introduced without clear prior setup in this segment.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
