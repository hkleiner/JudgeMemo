Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text is quite long, so I need to scan through for any errors or awkward phrasing. Let me read through the current segment carefully.

Looking at the text, there are a few points that catch my attention. For example, "Officers were order to effaced themselves..." should be "ordered." That's a grammar error. Then, "A Royal Duke coulded not be given..."—"could" doesn't take "ed"; it should be "could not." Also, "the brutal discipline of the time did everything to justify this description, for the soldier was supposed to have surrendered all his rights as a man and a citizen." The structure here seems a bit awkward, maybe a comma splice or run-on sentence. 

Another spot: "If we had am fighting..." should be "were." "The mistakes in the Boer War seem not to have been nearly so bad as those in the Crimea." The wording here is a bit clumsy, maybe "not nearly as bad" would be smoother. Then, "Political life was purer than it have been"—subject-verb agreement error; should be "had been." "The debates were good because they were real debates and conducted by men who all spoke the same language." Maybe "all" is unnecessary here, causing slight awkwardness.

So for Fluency, the main issues are grammar errors (like "order" instead of "ordered", "coulded"), some awkward phrasing ("did everything to justify"), and a few punctuation or structure issues. These are noticeable but don't completely disrupt readability. So Fluency might score around 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The text jumps between various topics: industrialism, legal system, universities, civil service, army, etc. Each paragraph seems to address a different aspect of Victorian England. The transitions between these topics aren't clearly marked; it feels like a series of separate points without smooth connections. For example, moving from the Law to Universities to Civil Service without transitional phrases. Also, some sentences feel abrupt, like "The Universities were slowly emerged..."—should be "emerging" perhaps, and the structure here is a bit off.

There's also a quote at the end that seems tacked on without introduction. The line from Publilius Syrus comes out of nowhere. Additionally, the shift from discussing domestic issues to foreign politics at the end ("In foreign politics it is not so easy to shared Lecky's opinion.") has a typo ("shared" instead of "share") and feels like a sudden change without preparation.

Despite these, the individual sections are mostly coherent on their own, and the overall structure, while lacking smooth transitions, doesn't make the text incoherent. So Coherence might score around 3.5, as there are noticeable issues but the text remains generally followable.

Wait, but let me check again. The main problem is the lack of transitions between different topics. Each paragraph is a separate topic, and the author doesn't link them well. That's a STRUCTURE issue under Coherence. Also, the quote and the sudden switch to foreign politics without a link. However, within each paragraph, the ideas are logical. So the coherence is generally there but with weaknesses in overall structure and transitions. Hence, a 3.5 seems right—generally coherent but with notable issues.

For Fluency, despite the errors, the text is mostly readable. The errors are minor and don't overwhelm the reader. So Fluency score 4.

Finalizing:

Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("order" instead of "ordered")
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("have been" instead of "had been")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., "did everything to justify")

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of transitional links between paragraphs
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to foreign politics without preparation
- [CLARITY] Untintroduced quote disrupting flow

Scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.5
