Okay, let me tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to understand the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as defined. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is a historical or anthropological excerpt, probably from an older document given the terminology and style. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexical issues. 

Reading through the Current Segment, I notice a few things. There's a part that says "the bodies of richer people was burnt". That should be "were burnt" – subject-verb agreement error. Also, "the marriages was arranged" – should be "were arranged". These are grammatical mistakes. 

There are some awkward phrasings, like "a kind ol Governor General". Probably a typo for "old". Also, "call upon in case of need" might be a bit formal but not necessarily wrong. Punctuation seems mostly okay, but there's a lot of complex sentences which might affect flow, but given the academic tone, maybe that's expected. 

For Coherence, the text jumps between different topics: history of the Yögurs, their structure, customs, marriage practices. Each section seems to connect to the overall topic of describing the tribe, but transitions could be smoother. For example, moving from administrative divisions to funeral customs without a clear link. However, in academic writing, such sections might be expected as different aspects of the tribe. 

There's a part where it mentions "the earlier custom of entertaining guests... has gradually disappeared under the influence of the lamas." That connects the change in practices, so maybe that's a logical flow. But some paragraphs feel like lists (like the "bones" classification and administrative divisions) which might disrupt coherence for a general reader. 

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite a couple of grammatical errors and some typos, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt too much. So maybe a 4? 

For Coherence, the structure is somewhat disjointed with various topics, but each part contributes to understanding the tribe. Transitions are weak, but the overall logic holds. So maybe a 3.5 or 4? 

Wait, the criteria for Coherence 4 says "mostly coherent with a few weak parts". The text has several distinct sections without clear transitions, so maybe 3.5 because the shifts are more than a few. 

Finalizing: Fluency 4 (minor errors, mostly fluent), Coherence 3.5 (some disjointedness but overall logical).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "the bodies ... was burnt")  
   - [SPELLING] Typo ("ol" instead of "old")  
   - [LEXICON] Formal/archaic phrasing (e.g., "call upon in case of need")  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., administrative divisions to funeral customs)  
   - [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between paragraphs  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
