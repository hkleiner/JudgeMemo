Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess both Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexicon issues. The first thing I notice is the sentence structure. Most sentences are complex and long, which might affect readability. For example, "Money was spent so lavishly on the entertainment of the innumerable persons of distinction who were present or took part in the great ceremony that for several years the finances of the see were unpleasantly reminiscent of the vast expenditure." That's a bit of a mouthful. Maybe a comma splice or awkward phrasing here.

Checking for spelling errors: "coulded" instead of "could" in "nearly everything that coulded burn had vanished." That's a clear typo. Also, "was a bearer of the great iron-bound chest" should probably be "was not old enough to be a bearer." Wait, the original says "he was not old enough to was a bearer"â€”that's a grammatical error. Should be "was not old enough to be a bearer." 

Another spot: "woulded have saved" instead of "would have saved." And "should was procured" should be "should be procured." These are definite errors affecting fluency.

For Coherence, I need to check logical flow, transitions, and structure. The text jumps between different time periods: after Henry's penance, the fire, reconstruction, then events in 1220, 1378, etc. While it's chronological, some transitions might be abrupt. For example, moving from the fire in the choir to the translation of Becket's remains might need smoother connections. Also, the paragraph about the decline and Queen Elizabeth feels a bit disconnected from the architectural details preceding it. The text assumes some background knowledge, like the significance of the Transitional Period in architecture, which might confuse readers without context.

Now, categorizing the issues. For Fluency, the main problems are [SPELLING] (coulded, woulded), [GRAMMAR] (was a bearer error), and possibly [SYNTAX] with overly complex sentences. For Coherence, [TRANSITION] between paragraphs and [STRUCTURE] in handling multiple time jumps without clear links.

Scoring Fluency: There are a few spelling and grammar errors, but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 4? But the errors are noticeable, so perhaps 3.5? Since the errors don't completely disrupt understanding but are present.

Coherence: The structure is generally logical but has some abrupt shifts and assumes knowledge. Maybe a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but with some weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "coulded", "woulded" (subject-verb agreement errors)  
- [GRAMMAR] "was not old enough to was a bearer" (missing "be")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Money was spent so lavishly...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between time periods (e.g., 1220 festival to 1378 reconstruction)  
- [STRUCTURE] Assumes background knowledge (e.g., architectural styles, historical context)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
