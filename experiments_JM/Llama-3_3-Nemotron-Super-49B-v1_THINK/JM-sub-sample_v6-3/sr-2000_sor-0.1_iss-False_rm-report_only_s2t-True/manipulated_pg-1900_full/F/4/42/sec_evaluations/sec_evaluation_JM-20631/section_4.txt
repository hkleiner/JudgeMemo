Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the instructions. The user wants me to assess the current segment based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided scales. I shouldn't look at the previous section except for context, but my judgment is only on the current part.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads—grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The current segment is a dense, academic text with complex sentences. I notice some long, convoluted sentences that might make reading difficult. For example, the part about Moses and the golden calf has a lot of clauses stacked together. There's also some archaic language like "whom" and "wherein" which might affect modern readability. Are there any grammatical errors? I didn't spot obvious ones, but the structure is sometimes awkward. Maybe a few places where the phrasing is a bit off, like "I must continued to call" should be "I must continue to call"—that's a minor error. So Fluency issues would be syntax and grammar in sentence structure, maybe some lexical choices that are less common.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The text jumps between different examples: from Mr. Abrahams' book to Genesis, then to Racine's play, comparisons with Pope Gregory, and various historical figures like Maimonides, Spinoza, etc. The transitions between these points might not be very smooth. For instance, moving from the Sodom story to Moses intervening, then to the Talmud, and so on. Each paragraph seems to introduce new elements without clear connectors. The author assumes a lot of background knowledge (e.g., biblical references, historical figures) which could confuse readers not familiar with them. However, the overall theme of challenging the tribal God concept is consistent, but the execution might have abrupt shifts. So Coherence issues would be transitions and clarity, maybe some ambiguity in how examples support the main point.

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly readable but has noticeable issues. The errors are minor (like the "continued" typo) but the complex sentences frequent enough to deduct. Maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally fluent but with several awkward spots.

Coherence: The ideas are connected to the main argument, but the presentation is disjointed with many examples that aren't clearly linked. It's understandable with effort, so maybe a 3? Because while the structure is there, the flow is interrupted often.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, nested sentence structures (e.g., "But if 'by early literature'...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "invidiously," "dynast of endlessness").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "I must continued to call").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biblical examples, literary quotes, and historical critiques.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes specialized knowledge (e.g., Talmudic references, Maimonides’ metaphysics).  
- [STRUCTURE] Ideas (e.g., universalism vs. tribalism) are logically connected but poorly sequenced.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
