Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Let me read through the current segment carefully. The text seems well-structured with proper sentences. I notice a few potential issues. For example, in the sentence "He become a national hero." Shouldn't that be "He became..."? That's a grammar error. Also, "the king wrote her a letter of invitation" – maybe "an" instead of "her"? Wait, no, "her" is correct here as the object. Maybe other minor things. Checking for awkward phrasing: "Fragonard had at last to turn his face homewards;" – "homewards" is a bit formal but acceptable. "dawdling through Italy with Saint-Non, staying his feet at Bologna and Venice awhile" – "staying his feet" is a bit odd; maybe "staying his steps" or just "staying awhile"? That's a syntax issue. Also, "the two friends worked slowly towards Paris" – seems okay. Later, "He reached Paris, rich in plans for pictures, filled with ardour and enthusiasm for his art, ambitious to create masterpieces, and burning to distinguish himself." That's a long sentence but flows okay. 

In the Coherence section, looking at how the ideas connect. The segment starts with Fragonard in Italy, then jumps to Paris and political changes, then back to Fragonard's return, his work, and his shift in style. The transition from the political part (Choiseul) to Fragonard's return might feel a bit abrupt. The paragraph about the political intrigue (Pompadour, De Stainville) seems like a tangent. It's part of the context but in the current segment, it's included. Does it disrupt the coherence? Maybe, because it's historical background not directly linked to Fragonard's artistic development, except perhaps setting the time period. Then it transitions back to Fragonard's return to Paris. The rest of the segment follows his career progression logically. So the main coherence issue might be the abrupt shift from Fragonard's time in Italy to the detailed political events in Paris without a clear connector. Also, the paragraph starting "When Fragonard came back to Paris..." introduces Boucher's change, which connects to Fragonard's shift away from academic style. That seems coherent. Later parts about his famous painting and success flow well. 

For Fluency, the main issues are the grammatical error ("He become") and a couple of awkward phrases ("staying his feet"). These are minor but noticeable. Since the scale for Fluency 4 allows minor issues that don't disrupt readability much, but these might push it to a 4. 

For Coherence, the abrupt political section might cause a deduction. If the historical part is considered necessary context but not well-integrated, it could affect coherence. However, the rest of the segment flows logically. So maybe a score of 4 for Coherence, as mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Wait, the Fluency error "He become" is a clear subject-verb agreement mistake. That's a significant grammar error. How many such errors are there? Only one mentioned here. The rest of the text is mostly fluent. So Fluency might be a 4 because it's mostly fluent with a minor error. Coherence has that one abrupt transition but overall logical flow, so also a 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense in "He become a national hero" (should be "became").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard’s Italy stay to unrelated French political intrigue without contextual bridge.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
