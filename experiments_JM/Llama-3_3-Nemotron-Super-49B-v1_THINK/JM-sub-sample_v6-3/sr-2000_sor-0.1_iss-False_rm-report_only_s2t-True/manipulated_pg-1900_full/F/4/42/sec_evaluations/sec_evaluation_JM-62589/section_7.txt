Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the provided current segment.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. I'll go through the text and note any issues. 

Looking at the first sentence: "No one think much of him during the next few days." That should be "No one thought much of him" for subject-verb agreement. That's a grammar error [GRAMMAR]. 

Then, "He recovered with the care of the new recruit, Jack Martin—as well as might be expected," The phrase "as well as might be expected" feels a bit awkward. Maybe "as could be expected" is more common, so that's a phrasing issue [LEXICON]. 

In the next paragraph: "Lord Percy, after receiving the news which had been delayed by Shirtliffe bore it to the enemy," The sentence structure here is confusing. It seems like a missing verb or incorrect conjunction. Maybe "which had been delayed by Shirtliffe" should be rephrased for clarity [SYNTAX]. 

Further on: "He intend opening battle upon the afternoon of his arrival," Should be "He intended" [GRAMMAR]. 

Later: "Washington, who ever made his successes out of other men’s failures," "Ever" here might be incorrect; perhaps "who always" or "who continually" [LEXICON]. 

In the dialogue: "“If I live, Jack, I’ll soon be back. I’m sure to find Morley and then—there will be nothing left but for me to come back.”" The transition from finding Morley to coming back feels a bit unclear. Maybe needs smoother connection [TRANSITION]. 

In the chapter VII part: "Robert Shirtliffe sat beside a frozen stream binding a cloth around his frosted feet." "Frosted feet" might not be the best term; "frostbitten" could be better [LEXICON]. 

"His clothing, too, was worn and thin and but poorly protected him from the cutting blast." "But" here is incorrect; should be "and" for consistency [GRAMMAR]. 

"Shirtliffe have not seen, or heard of Morley." Should be "had not seen" [GRAMMAR]. 

"Washington smiled, and then looked pityingly down upon the wrap foot," "Wrap foot" is a typo, should be "wrapped foot" [SPELLING]. 

"Robert try to reply but his voice failed him." Should be "tried" [GRAMMAR]. 

So for Fluency, multiple grammar, syntax, and lexical issues. The errors are noticeable but don't make it unintelligible. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are several errors, the text is generally readable.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connections between ideas. 

The segment starts with Robert recovering, then moves to the relieving army, Lord Percy's plans, the storm, Washington's actions, the British leaving, then a dispute between Robert and Jack, and then jumps to Chapter VII with Robert alone by a stream. The transition from the Boston scene to Chapter VII (Christmas Eve by the Delaware) feels abrupt. There's a time jump without clear indication [STRUCTURE]. 

Within Chapter VII, the scene with Washington is well-connected, but the overall flow from the previous part to this chapter might lack a smooth transition. However, since it's a new chapter, maybe that's expected. But within the current segment, the ideas mostly flow logically, except for the abrupt chapter start. 

Also, the motivation for Robert's persistence in finding Morley is clear, driven by Mason's dying words and the mystery. The dialogue between Robert and Jack conveys their relationship and Robert's determination. The shift to Washington's prayer and the meeting with Robert is a bit sudden but works within the narrative. 

So Coherence issues mainly with the structural transition into Chapter VII. The rest is generally coherent. Maybe a 4? Because the main ideas connect well, but there's a notable structural jump.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "No one think", "Shirtliffe have not seen")  
   - [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "as well as might be expected", "frosted feet")  
   - [SYNTAX] Confusing sentence structure (e.g., "Lord Percy... bore it to the enemy")  
   - [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "wrap foot")  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to Chapter VII without contextual bridge  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
