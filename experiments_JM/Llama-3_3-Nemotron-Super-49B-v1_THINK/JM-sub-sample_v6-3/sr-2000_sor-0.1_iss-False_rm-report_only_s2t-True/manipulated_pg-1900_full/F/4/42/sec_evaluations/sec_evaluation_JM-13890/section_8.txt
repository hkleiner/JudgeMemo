Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. Reading through the current segment, the text seems mostly well-written. There's a complex sentence structure, but that's common in descriptive historical texts. Wait, I noticed a possible typo: "the ground, unoccupied by buildings, soil hallowed..." Shouldn't it be "soil" or maybe a comma missing? Also, "the popular mind had seemingly forget" – that's a tense error; should be "seemingly forgotten". Another spot: "the Abbey had sunk to inconceivably debased uses" – "inconceivably" might be a bit formal, but not an error. "The monastic kitchen have been converted" – subject-verb agreement issue; should be "was". Also, "the momentous days when England is was released" – duplicate "was" and incorrect verb tense. These are specific errors. Despite some complex sentences, the overall flow is good. So Fluency issues are present but not overwhelming. Maybe a 4 because the errors are minor but noticeable.

Now Coherence. The text moves through various topics: the Abbey's history, its decline, rescue, and then other sites in Canterbury. Each paragraph connects to the overall theme of historical sites. However, there's a jump from discussing the Abbey to suddenly mentioning St. Martin's Church without a clear transition. Also, the last paragraph lists many remaining sites abruptly. The structure is mostly logical, but some transitions are weak. The ideas are generally connected but with some abrupt shifts. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since while mostly coherent, there are some weak connections between paragraphs.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("had seemingly forget")  
- [SPELLING/GRAMMAR] Repetition ("England is was")  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement ("kitchen have been")  
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary ("inconceivably debased")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Abbey to St. Martin's Church  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected list of remaining sites in final paragraph  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
