Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., ensuring smooth flow. The text is quite formal and dense, filled with philosophical and scientific terms. I notice some complex sentence structures, which might make it hard to follow, but they seem grammatically correct. There's a use of semicolons and commas appropriately. However, there are a few spots with awkward phrasing. For example, "we must not call to our aid some psychic entity..." feels a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. Also, "which a smaller man woulded not have had" – wait, "woulded" isn't a word. That's a typo; should be "would have". That's a clear spelling/grammar error. Another possible issue: "it was one that does honour to the man" – "does" here might be better as "does him honour", but maybe it's an archaic usage. Not sure if that's an error or just formal. Also, "if it is to be included in a philosophy of science it must be deal with" – missing "treated" or "dealt with"? "Deal with" is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit convoluted. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are the "woulded" error and some complex, though correct, structures. Since the errors are minor but present, maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has a noticeable error.

Now Coherence. The text discusses Spencer's philosophy, his evolution of thought, and critiques his handling of cognitive relations. The structure seems logical, moving from discussing Spencer's departure in his later work, then analyzing his views on cognition, and contrasting with scientific requirements. However, the text jumps between different aspects of Spencer's philosophy without clear transitions. For example, the shift from talking about vital characters to the cognitive relation feels a bit abrupt. Also, the example with the billiard ball introduces a new scenario without a smooth lead-in. The concepts are interconnected but the connections could be clearer. There's some repetition in emphasizing the distinction between vivid and faint states of consciousness, which might slightly disrupt flow. 

Coherence issues would include abrupt transitions and some unclear connections between paragraphs. The ideas are mostly logical but not always smoothly connected. So maybe a 4 for Coherence as well, since it's mostly coherent but has some weak links.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (should be "would have")  
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing (e.g., "does honour to the man")  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Spencer’s vitalism to cognitive relation analysis  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense philosophical distinctions (e.g., vivid/faint states)  
- [STRUCTURE] Late introduction of billiard-ball example without clear setup  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
