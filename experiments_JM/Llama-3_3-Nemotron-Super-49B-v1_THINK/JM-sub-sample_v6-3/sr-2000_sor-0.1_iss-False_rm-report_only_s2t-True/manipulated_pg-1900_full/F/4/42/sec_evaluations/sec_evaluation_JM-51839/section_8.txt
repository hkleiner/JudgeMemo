Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. The text seems to be historical, listing various locations and events. Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax issues. 

In the first sentence: "The house was build about 1830..." — "build" should be "built". That's a clear grammar error. Then, "provided with port-holes for shooting Indians in case of attack." The word "port-holes" is correctly spelled, but maybe "portholes" is more common, though not necessarily an error. 

Next part: "Pendleton Ferry was the original ferry on the King’s Highway across the Sabine river; now spanned by a splendid interstate bridge." The semicolon usage here might be a bit abrupt, but it's correct. The transition to the bridge is okay. 

Moving to the Masonic Lodge section. "Some time in the Spring of 1837..." — "Some time" should probably be "Sometime" (one word) for correct usage. Then, "a movement for the organization of a Masonic lodge began which culminated in a dispensation..." The sentence is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

Further down: "The first meeting of the Lodge under dispensation was hold in the Old Stone Fort..." — "was hold" should be "was held". Another grammar error. 

Checking for other issues: Names and dates seem correctly capitalized and formatted. Punctuation mostly looks okay, though some sentences are long, but that's common in historical texts. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are two clear grammatical errors ("build" instead of "built", "was hold" instead of "was held"). These are noticeable but don't make the text unreadable. So Fluency score would be 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The section jumps between different topics: the house, Pendleton Ferry, McMahan’s Chapel, then into the Masonic Lodge history, followed by chapters on the college building and the university project. Each part seems related to Nacogdoches history, but the transitions between them are abrupt. For example, after talking about the lodge, it suddenly moves to Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College without a clear link. Similarly, the last paragraph about rebuilding the university switches to a call to action, which feels out of place in an otherwise descriptive text. 

However, since it's a historical excerpt with chapter headings, the abruptness might be due to the chapter breaks. But within the current segment, especially the Masonic Lodge part, the structure is clear. The problem is the lack of smooth transitions between the different historical points. So Coherence would have issues in structure and transitions, but the individual sections are logical. Hence, a score of 3.5 maybe, as it's generally coherent but with noticeable shifts.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "build" should be "built" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [GRAMMAR] "was hold" should be "was held" (verb tense consistency error)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between unrelated historical topics (e.g., from lodge history to college building)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connecting phrases between distinct sections (e.g., "CHAPTER" breaks without contextual links)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
