Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is a descriptive piece, likely from an old travelogue or expedition report. The language is formal and detailed. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexical issues. 

Skimming through, I notice a few things. There's a sentence: "The outlines ol which could be discerned in the misty distance." The word "ol" should be "of"—that's a spelling error. Also, "There am seven or eight lamas" should be "There are"—subject-verb agreement mistake. These are clear errors. 

Syntax-wise, some sentences are very long and complex, which might affect fluency. For example, the paragraph describing the temple and lamas has multiple clauses stacked without clear transitions, making it a bit hard to follow. However, the overall structure of sentences is mostly correct. Word choice seems appropriate for the period and context, though some terms like "etappe stations" might be less common, but that's more about vocabulary choice than an error.

Now, Coherence. The section starts with the expedition's movement, then describes encountering the Yögur village, interactions, and details about the village and its people. The narrative moves from geographical description to cultural and administrative details. 

I need to check if ideas are logically connected. The transition from describing the landscape to the village encounter seems okay. However, when moving from the village's legend to the linguistic differences and then to the temple and administration, there might be some abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing the legend about their origins, it jumps to language similarities with Khirgis and Turkish without a clear link. Also, the part about the lamas' education and the written language feels a bit disconnected from the preceding cultural history. 

But overall, the text follows a coherent structure: travel description, meeting locals, cultural insights, then specifics about the village and its customs. The only major issue is the lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs, causing minor disruptions.

For Fluency, the errors ("ol" and "There am") are noticeable but not frequent. The long sentences might slightly hinder flow, but the text is mostly readable. So Fluency score would be around 4, maybe 4.5 if the errors are considered minor.

For Coherence, the structure is generally logical, but some transitions are weak, and there are abrupt topic changes. However, the overall narrative holds together. So Coherence might score a 4, as the issues don't significantly disrupt understanding but are present.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "ol" instead of "of" in "the outlines ol which"  
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., paragraph describing temple/lamas)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There am seven or eight lamas" (subject-verb agreement)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from village legend to linguistic comparisons (no connecting sentence)  
- [STRUCTURE] Disconnected discussion of lamas’ education and written language from preceding cultural context  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, unbroken paragraphs for detailed administrative/tax descriptions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
