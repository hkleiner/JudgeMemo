Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is quite dense and uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures. I notice a few possible errors. For example, "Still, to have take a definite..." should be "taken" instead of "take"—that's a subject-verb agreement error. Also, "shoulded be laid" is incorrect; it should be "should be laid." There's also "I must left" which should be "leave." These are grammatical errors. Additionally, some sentences are very long and convoluted, which might affect fluency. For instance, the paragraph starting with "It will perhaps be said..." has multiple clauses and could be broken up for better flow. However, despite these issues, the text is generally readable. The errors are minor but noticeable, so maybe a score of 4 for Fluency since it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect and the overall logical flow. The text discusses Spencer's philosophy, his emphasis on certain aspects, and critiques of his use of terms like "force." There are transitions like "It will perhaps be said..." and "And so..." which help connect ideas. However, the text jumps between discussing Spencer's contributions, his use of "force," the Unknowable, and the distinction between science and philosophy. Some parts feel a bit abrupt, like the shift from talking about the Spencerian creed to discussing the Unknowable without a clear transition. Also, the paragraph starting "Now, as I understand the position..." introduces a contrast with science's approach, which might feel a bit disconnected from the preceding discussion. The text assumes some background knowledge of Spencer's work, which could make it less clear for readers not familiar with it. Despite this, the overall structure is logical, just with some rough transitions. Maybe a Coherence score of 3.5 because while generally coherent, there are noticeable shifts and assumptions that affect clarity.

Wait, let me double-check. For Coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions and the dense, assumed knowledge. The text is mostly understandable but has segments where the connection between ideas isn't smooth. So 3.5 seems right. For Fluency, the errors are present but don't disrupt readability too much, so 4.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("to have take") and incorrect verb form ("shoulded")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, lengthy sentences impairing clarity  
- [SPELLING/GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency ("I must left")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between ideas (e.g., shift from Spencerian creed to Unknowable)  
- [CLARITY] Assumes specialized background knowledge of Spencer’s philosophy  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between critiques of "force" and broader philosophical context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
