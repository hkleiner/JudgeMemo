Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to assess the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific scales. The text is a segment from a longer document, and I should evaluate it on its own, considering possible external context but not the provided previous section.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is quite long, so I need to scan through for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the text, the structure seems mostly clear. Sentences are generally well-formed. However, there are a few spots that might cause issues. For example, "Additional sales woulded tax the plant..." should be "would have taxed" – "woulded" is incorrect, it's "would have". That's a grammar error. Another point: "I was asked to design a new lay-out and to take over the art editorship during its formative period." The word "lay-out" is correctly hyphenated here, but sometimes hyphenation can be an issue, though in this context, it's acceptable. 

There's also a sentence: "The mixing of roman and italic in radically different sizes and with consideration for desired emphasis, with possibly a 96- or 120-point roman cap starting a 48- or 60-point italic word, resulted just as I had visualized while the type was being set in fragmentary form." This is a complex sentence but still understandable. Maybe a bit wordy, but not a major fluency issue. 

Another possible issue: "Somewhere along the trail Spoils, a drama in verse, and Launcelot and the Ladies, a novel, were written..." The phrase "Somewhere along the trail" is a bit informal or vague. Not a fluency problem per se, but maybe clarity. However, Fluency is more about the mechanical aspects. 

So for Fluency, the main issue is the "woulded" error. That's a clear grammar mistake. Are there others? Let me check again. "That night, at home, I trimmed and mounted proofs in a new dummy." Seems okay. "No changes were necessary, and every minute of the afternoon had been good fun." "Had been good fun" is a bit awkward in tense, but not a major error. Maybe a slight phrasing issue. 

So Fluency score: There's at least one clear grammar error ("woulded"), and maybe some minor phrasing awkwardness. According to the scale, a 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." Since "woulded" is a noticeable error but the rest is mostly okay, maybe 4.0 or 3.5? Wait, the scale says Score 4 allows minor issues that don't disrupt readability. The "woulded" is a mistake, but the rest flows well. So maybe 4.0.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas connect, logical progression, transitions. The current segment starts with an editorial dinner, then moves to the author's work with Collier's, then jumps to working with Hearst, describing various projects like Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan changes, and the typographic work. The structure seems chronological, moving through different projects and time periods (Nineties, 1915, 1920, etc.). 

However, there are abrupt transitions between paragraphs. For example, after discussing the pent-house studio idea, it jumps to renting a studio on the 45th floor of the Metropolitan Tower, then talks about Condé Nast buying Vogue. The connection between these could be smoother. Also, the transition from Collier's to Hearst's projects feels a bit abrupt without a clear connector. The chapter title "ENTER MR. HEARST" helps, but within the section, the shift from one employer's projects to another might lack a transitional sentence. 

Another point: The paragraph about Spoils and Launcelot feels like a tangent, just mentioning writings without clear connection to the surrounding context. It disrupts the flow slightly. Also, the sentence structure varies, with some long, detailed descriptions (like the typography work) and shorter statements. 

But overall, the narrative follows a logical timeline, and each paragraph deals with a distinct project or period. The main issues are the abrupt transitions between some sections and the tangential mention of the writings. According to the Coherence scale, a score of 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." If the transitions are just slightly weak but the overall logic holds, maybe 4.0. But if the abruptness is more noticeable, maybe 3.5. Since the section is mostly clear but has some disconnected parts, I'd lean towards 4.0 for Coherence.

Wait, but the transition from the Metropolitan Tower studio to working on various magazines (Metropolitan, Century, etc.) could be smoother. The paragraph starts "In this new environment..." which connects the studio to the work, so that's okay. The jump to "Among some discarded Metropolitan covers..." might feel sudden, but it's still within the art editorship context. The main issue is the lack of transitions between major sections like Collier's to Hearst, but the chapter title helps. So maybe Coherence is 4.0.

But let me check again. The Coherence issues would be:

- Abrupt transition from Collier's projects to Hearst's without a clear link.
- The paragraph about Spoils and Launcelot seems out of place.
- Some paragraphs jump between different projects without transitional phrases.

These are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So Coherence score 4.0.

Fluency: One clear grammar error ("woulded"), otherwise mostly fluent. Score 4.0.

But wait, the user's scale for Fluency 4 says "minor issues... noticeable but don't disrupt readability." The "woulded" error is noticeable but doesn't disrupt much. So 4.0 for Fluency.

Coherence: A few weak transitions and a tangential paragraph, but overall logical. Score 4.0.

Alternatively, if the transitions are more problematic, maybe 3.5. But given the chapter break and the generally chronological order, I think 4.0 is appropriate.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("woulded" instead of "would have") in "Additional sales woulded tax the plant..."  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Collier’s projects to Hearst’s work without transitional context; - [STRUCTURE] Tangential mention of "Spoils" and "Launcelot and the Ladies" without clear relevance to surrounding narrative.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4.0**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.0**
