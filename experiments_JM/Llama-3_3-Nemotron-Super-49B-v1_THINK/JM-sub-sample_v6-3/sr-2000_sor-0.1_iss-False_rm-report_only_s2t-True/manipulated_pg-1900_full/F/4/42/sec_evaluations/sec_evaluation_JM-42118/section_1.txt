Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite descriptive and uses complex sentences. I notice some long, winding sentences that might affect readability. For example, the sentence about the glovemaker looking out and his vows has multiple clauses. There's also "vex with the high ambitions" which might be a typo or awkward phrasingâ€”should it be "unvexed"? Also, "the things they shadowed were bury under" seems incorrect; it should be "buried". 

Looking at grammar, there's "the child grow up" which should be "grew". "Allowed to follow his bent" might need "be" before "allowed". Some word choices are a bit archaic, like "gadding fashions" or "fopperies", but that's stylistic. Spelling seems okay, but "millineries" might be a typo for "millinery". 

For Coherence, the narrative jumps between describing Grasse, the boy's life, and then detailed historical events about Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. The transition from the boy's idling to the news about being articled feels abrupt. The historical sections are detailed but might disrupt the flow of the boy's storyline. There's also a shift from the boy's artistic inclinations to the notary job without clear connection. 

So for Fluency, despite some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 4 because the issues are minor but noticeable. 

For Coherence, the historical inserts feel like info dumps and disrupt the narrative flow. The transitions between scenes could be smoother. So maybe a 3.5 because while the overall structure is there, the shifts are jarring.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the child grow up" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "millineries" (likely "millinery")  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "As the glovemaker looked out...")  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("gadding," "fopperies") may impede modern readability  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from descriptive prose to dense historical exposition (e.g., Pompadour details)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between Grasse setting and biographical/historical events  
- [CLARITY] Overly elaborate descriptions delay narrative progression (e.g., "the glory of it bathed the lad's eyes...")  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
