Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few errors. For example, "He lose his territory" should be "He lost his territory"—that's a grammar error [GRAMMAR]. Then there's "woulded weary" which should be "would weary" or "grew weary"; that's another grammar issue. Also, "grains of myrrh gum" might be a bit awkward phrasing, maybe "grains of myrrh" or specifying the type, but not a major error. The text is mostly readable, but these minor issues add up. The structure is generally good, with complex sentences that are mostly clear. So Fluency might score a 4 because there are some noticeable errors but the text is still mostly fluent.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect and the overall structure. The current segment discusses various historical figures and their conflicts, then transitions into discussing the Egyptian system, King Burnaburiash's complaint, and then Abi-milki's letter. The shifts between these topics might feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from Abdikheba's situation to the broader Egyptian governance issue and then to specific letters might lack smooth transitions [TRANSITION]. Also, the part about the Habiri (Hebrews) and their locations seems a bit inserted without clear connection to the preceding context [LOGIC]. However, each section within itself is logical, and the overall narrative isn't hard to follow. There's no major disjointedness, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor connectivity issues but overall coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("He lose his territory").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb form ("woulded weary").  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing ("grains of myrrh gum").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Abdikheba’s conflict to Egyptian governance critique.  
- [LOGIC] Tangential mention of Habiri/Hebrews without clear contextual integration.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
