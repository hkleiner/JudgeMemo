Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a narrative with various scenes: Excalibur's interactions, the curate's breakfast, Eileen's visit, and then the tennis lawn part. 

Looking through the text, I notice a few things. The sentence structure is mostly varied and complex, which is good for fluency. However, there are some long sentences that might cause slight pauses. For example, the paragraph starting "It was his daily walk..." has a sentence that's a bit convoluted with multiple clauses. Also, the part where the curate explains his schedule ("I take early Service...") might be a bit dense. 

Checking for grammar or spelling errors: The text seems well-written, but there's a line "think Eileen whom the-remark-'s had a on ago called few continued," which looks garbled. That's definitely a typo or formatting issue, disrupting fluency. Also, "unsalable" should probably be "unsellable," though both are acceptable in some contexts. 

For Coherence, the narrative flows logically from Excalibur's daily activities to the encounter with the curate, then to the developing relationship and the tennis lawn incident. Each part connects to the overall story of Excalibur's role. However, the transition from the curate's breakfast scene to the tennis lawn part (after CHAPTER V) feels a bit abrupt. The chapter heading might indicate a time jump, but within the segment, it's not fully smoothed out. Also, some sections might have repetitive ideas, like Excalibur's constant presence, but it's part of the character development.

So for Fluency Issues:
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in a few places.
- [SPELLING/TYPO] Garbled text in one line and possible "unsalable".
- [LEXICON] "Unsalable" might be less common, causing a slight hitch.

For Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition after CHAPTER V heading.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear link between the curate's scenes and the tennis lawn.

Scores: Fluency would be a 4 because despite some complexity and errors, it's mostly smooth. Coherence is a 4 too, as the story holds together with minor structural jumps.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., nested clauses).
- [SPELLING/TYPO] Apparent formatting error ("think Eileen whom...") and "unsalable" (less common spelling).
- [LEXICON] Minor word-choice awkwardness (e.g., "unsalable").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden time jump after "CHAPTER: V" without transitional context.
- [TRANSITION] Mild disjointedness between indoor dialogue and outdoor tennis lawn scene.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
