Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking through the current segment, there are a few parts that stand out. For example, the first sentence "Margot ever would she, if know find not did and wondered out." That's really fragmented. The word order is incorrect; it seems like a jumbled mix of questions and statements. That's a clear syntax issue. Then there's "For Margot the her-life in Dennison own would, eight twenty would have of, years first her delighted agreed have beauty." Again, the structure is off. Words like "her-life" and the phrase "eight twenty" without context are confusing. These are syntax and grammar problems.

Another spot: "point man his?" That's unclear and lacks proper structure. Maybe a typo or missing words. Also, "proto-man, an unknown pre-human ancestor..." seems okay, but later in the dialogue, there are explanations about hyper-space that are a bit dense but still understandable. However, sentences like "The Enterprise...." with an ellipsis and no following sentence might disrupt flow, but maybe it's intentional for drama. Overall, while most of the text is readable, these jumbled sentences cause significant interruptions. So Fluency would be around 3, since there are multiple issues but the text is still generally readable.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect and the overall structure. The segment starts with Margot's thoughts, then jumps to the Irwadi technicians working on the Dog Star. Then introduces Ramar Chind and his crew, followed by Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin preparing for blastoff. The dialogue about hyper-space explains necessary concepts but feels a bit info-dumpy. The transition from the ship preparations to the dialogue about proto-man and time in hyper-space might be a bit abrupt. Also, the shift from the Enterprise's journey to the Dog Star's radar discussion could be smoother. However, each part mostly connects to the overall plot, even if some transitions are weak. The main issue is the info dump in the hyper-space explanations which might confuse readers, and some abrupt scene changes. So Coherence might score a 4, as it's mostly coherent but has some weaker connections and heavy explanations.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Fragmented sentence structures (e.g., "Margot ever would she...") - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect word order and missing articles/prepositions (e.g., "For Margot the her-life...") - [LEXICON] Unclear phrases (e.g., "eight twenty would have of") - [SYNTAX] Incomplete/ambiguous questions (e.g., "point man his?")
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., technicians to Enterprise crew) - [CLARITY] Overly dense scientific explanations disrupting flow - [TRANSITION] Weak links between proto-man backstory and hyper-space dialogue
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
