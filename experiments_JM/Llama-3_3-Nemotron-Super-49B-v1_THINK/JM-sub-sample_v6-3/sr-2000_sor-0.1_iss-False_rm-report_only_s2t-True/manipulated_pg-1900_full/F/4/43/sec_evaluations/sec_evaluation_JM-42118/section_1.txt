Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. The text is a descriptive piece about Fragonard's early life, set against the backdrop of 18th-century France. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text is written in a somewhat archaic, elaborate style, which might make it a bit dense. Let me check for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The sentences are long and complex, which could affect readability. For example, the sentence about the Pompadour's influence is very long and has multiple clauses. There's also a part where the sentence structure seems a bit off: "She was possessed of a rare combination of talents and accomplishments, and of astounding taste. But her deepest affection was for the arts." The transition here feels a bit abrupt. Also, the phrase "the new thought that was being born in France was nursed in her drawing-rooms" is a bit wordy. However, I don't see any outright grammatical errors. The vocabulary is rich but sometimes overly elaborate, which might cause some stumbling. So, Fluency might be a 4 because while it's mostly smooth, the complexity and some wordiness deduct points.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas flow and connect. The text jumps between Fragonard's childhood in Grasse and the political/scultural scene in Paris with the Pompadour and Boucher. The transitions between these sections could be smoother. For instance, after describing Grasse, it suddenly talks about the Pompadour's rise without a clear link. The paragraph about the Pompadour's powers feels like a large info dump that disrupts the narrative about Fragonard. Also, the shift from historical context back to the boy's life ("All this was but Paris-gossip...") feels a bit disconnected. There's a logical flow overall, but some sections are abrupt. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the main points connect, the transitions are weak and there are some disjointed parts.

Wait, let me double-check. The historical details are presented as background but take up a lot of space. The connection to Fragonard's development as an artist is mentioned, like how the beauty of Grasse inspired him, and Boucher's influence. But the lengthy descriptions of the Pompadour's actions might not be tightly integrated with Fragonard's story except through the art world connection. The structure is mostly chronological but with large blocks of different topics. So maybe Coherence is a 3.5 for noticeable issues but overall manageable.

Finalizing scores: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent but some complexity and wordiness), Coherence 3.5 (generally coherent but with some abrupt transitions and info dumps).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "sunburnt feet," "gadding fashions") may impede readability.  
   - [SYNTAX] Extremely long, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., Pompadour’s powers description).  
   - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between descriptive passages and historical tangents (e.g., "All this was but Paris-gossip...").  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Weak links between Grasse’s setting and Parisian political/artistic context (e.g., unmarked jumps from Fragonard’s childhood to royal scandals).  
   - [STRUCTURE] Excessive info-dumping on Pompadour’s role disrupts narrative focus on Fragonard.  
   - [CLARITY] Ambiguous connections between historical events and protagonist’s artistic development.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
