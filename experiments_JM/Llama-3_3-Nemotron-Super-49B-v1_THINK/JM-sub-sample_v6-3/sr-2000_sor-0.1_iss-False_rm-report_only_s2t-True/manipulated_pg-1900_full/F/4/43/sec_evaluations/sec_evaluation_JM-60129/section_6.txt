Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition mentions syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. I need to read through the text and spot any issues. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "The red mantles and togas in which the lamas sometimes drape themselves wearing their right arm and shoulder bare..." That sentence seems a bit wordy. Maybe "drape themselves" could be rephrased for better flow. Also, "wearing their right arm and shoulder bare" is a bit awkward; perhaps "with their right arm and shoulder bare" would be clearer. That's a syntax issue.

Further down: "we rode south up the hilly ridge..." The direction "south up" might be confusing. Typically, you ride up towards a higher elevation, but the direction is south. Maybe "southward up" or clarify the terrain. That's a clarity issue under LEXICON perhaps, or SYNTAX.

In the description of the t'umu's dwelling: "a couple of typical Shera YÃ¶gur dwellings, low grey tents raised on a low foundation of slender timbers, caulked with manure..." The phrase "caulked with manure" is unusual. Caulking usually refers to sealing gaps, and using manure for that is possible but might need explanation. Maybe a vocabulary choice issue [LEXICON].

Later, there's a sentence: "Neither lamas to origin about the know the much the the nor t'umu of seemed tribe." This looks like a jumbled sentence with missing words or incorrect structure. Definitely a SYNTAX and GRAMMAR problem here. It's hard to understand, so that's a major fluency issue.

For Coherence, the text jumps between describing landscapes, the t'umu's residence, tribal structure, historical origins, and documents. While mostly logical, there are abrupt transitions. For example, moving from the dwelling description to listing the rivers and territories without a clear connector. That's a TRANSITION issue. Also, the part about the origin discussion feels a bit disconnected from the preceding geographical details. Maybe a STRUCTURE problem.

The historical section about their migration and documents seems to follow logically, but the transition into it could be smoother. Also, the sentence about the document on silk feels a bit out of place without prior mention. Maybe CLARITY or STRUCTURE.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, there are several issues but the text is mostly readable. The jumbled sentence is severe, but overall, it's not too bad. Maybe a 3.5? Because there are multiple minor issues and one major syntax error.

For Coherence, the structure has some jumps but generally holds. The transitions could be better, and some sections feel a bit disconnected. Maybe a 4? Since it's mostly coherent with a few weak links.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., "wearing their right arm and shoulder bare").  
- [LEXICON] Unusual vocabulary choices (e.g., "caulked with manure").  
- [GRAMMAR] Severely jumbled sentence ("Neither lamas to origin...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between geographic description, tribal structure, and historical origin.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disconnected narrative threads (e.g., document on silk appears without setup).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
