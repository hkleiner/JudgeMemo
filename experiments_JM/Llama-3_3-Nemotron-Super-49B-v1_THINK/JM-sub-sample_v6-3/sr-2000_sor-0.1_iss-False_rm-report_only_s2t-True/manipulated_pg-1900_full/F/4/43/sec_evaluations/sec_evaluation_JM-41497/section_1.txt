Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the fluency and coherence of the given text. 

Starting with fluency: The text is mostly well-written with complex sentences. However, there are a few places where the sentence structure feels a bit convoluted. For example, the sentence "At the house enabled home sojourn Reynolds his, it Keppel back of art the see, to was met..." looks like it has a typo or a major grammatical error. That's definitely a [SYNTAX] issue. Also, some sentences are very long and might cause slight pauses in reading, but they're not too bad. Maybe a minor [SYNTAX] point there, but overall fluency is good. I'd say Fluency score around 4 because the main issue is that one jumbled sentence.

Now coherence: The text discusses Reynolds' life, his traits, and influences. The structure seems logical, moving from his character to his career milestones. However, there's a part where it jumps from talking about his technique to a quote about Dr. Johnson and then back to his self-control. The transitions between these ideas could be smoother. That's a [TRANSITION] issue. Also, the paragraph about his return to England mentions injuries but doesn't fully integrate that into the rest of the narrative. Maybe a [STRUCTURE] problem there. But overall, the coherence is mostly maintained. Coherence score might be 4 as well, since the issues are minor but noticeable.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severe grammatical error in sentence structure ("At the house enabled home sojourn...").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence lengths, though generally manageable.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift between discussing artistic technique and Dr. Johnsonâ€™s quote.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disconnect between injury narrative and broader career context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
