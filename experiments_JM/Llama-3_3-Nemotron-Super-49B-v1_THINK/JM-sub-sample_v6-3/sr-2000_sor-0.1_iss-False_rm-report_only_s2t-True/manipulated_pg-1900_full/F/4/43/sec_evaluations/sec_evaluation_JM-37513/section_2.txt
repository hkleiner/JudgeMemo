Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context except for background. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a philosophical discussion about Spencer's ideas, so the language is complex. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues.

Looking through the text, there are long, convoluted sentences. For example, the part starting with "In asserting it we assert an Unconditioned Reality..." seems a bit tangled. Also, there's a sentence with what looks like a typo or missing word: "In a at any, rate avowedly passage, which our is 'it knowledge and Cause conception transcends some leading of the persistence." That definitely disrupts fluency. Another spot: "the what all, save aspect their explanation subject objective, existence in more molecules or every units which save if is, object and in into distinguishable are Ultimate consciousness is obverse of Reality..." This section is very confusing and hard to parse. These indicate syntax and grammatical issues. Despite the complexity, the text is mostly readable, but these errors and awkward structures deduct points. So Fluency might be a 3.5 because while there are issues, the overall flow isn't completely broken.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how ideas are connected logically and the overall structure. The text discusses Spencer's philosophy, his emphasis on certain principles, and critiques of his use of terms like 'force'. There are transitions like "It will perhaps be said..." and "I must leave to some future..." which connect ideas, but some parts feel abrupt. For example, the shift from talking about Spencer's creed to discussing the Unknowable and then to science's limitations might feel a bit disconnected without clear transitions. Also, the paragraph structure is mostly logical, but the dense philosophical concepts might make it hard to follow without prior knowledge. However, the main points are generally connected, so Coherence is probably around 4, with minor disconnects but overall logical progression.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "In asserting it we assert an Unconditioned Reality...").  
- [GRAMMAR] Apparent typos/errors (e.g., "In a at any, rate avowedly passage...").  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the what all, save aspect their explanation...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Slightly abrupt shifts between critiques of Spencerâ€™s terminology and broader philosophical debates.  
- [CLARITY] Dense, specialized vocabulary and concepts assume high prior knowledge.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
