Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided, ignoring the previous section even though it's given for context. The task is to evaluate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is quite lengthy, so I need to scan through it carefully.

Looking at the text, the majority of it seems well-written with proper grammar and spelling. The sentences are mostly structured correctly. However, there are a couple of spots that caught my attention. For example, the line "Anthony its over it oldest found River jump the and fishing tree at to of, boys they that admire and that whenever Point Pleasant went the used stump the proportions inhabitant the the of remembered." This part looks garbled. The words are jumbled, which disrupts the flow. It seems like a typo or a missing word, making it hard to understand. That's a clear syntax and grammar issue.

Another area is the poem excerpts. While they are properly formatted with quotes and attributions, their integration into the narrative is smooth. However, there's a sentence later on: "Do from lad primer had ones who the at class since days ever of tail his been likely fall seem words of these his a the lips to?" This is completely unintelligible. The words are scattered without a coherent structure. This is a major fluency problem because it's impossible to decipher, causing a significant disruption.

For the rest, the text uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures, but they are mostly handled well. The use of commas and periods seems appropriate. So, the main fluency issues are those two jumbled sentences. Since these are noticeable but the rest of the text is fluent, the score would be around 4, but because there are two major errors, maybe 3.5? Wait, the scale says 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues. These errors are more than minor, especially the second one which is a full sentence that's nonsensical. So maybe Fluency is 3.5 because there are multiple issues that interrupt the flow.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow of ideas and how well the parts connect. The segment starts with the boy reading the book, then moves to his discovery of the wood, his vow, collecting wood, and then comparisons to Stradivarius. There's a shift to the schoolteacher's visit and the mother's conversation. The poem readings and the mother's response also tie into his understanding of craftsmanship.

The structure seems mostly logical, with each paragraph connecting to the theme of Anthony's dedication to violin making. However, the transition between the wood discovery and the schoolteacher part might feel a bit abrupt. The narrative jumps from his wood collection to the teacher's visit without a clear connector. Also, the inclusion of the poem about Stradivari seems relevant as it's explaining Anthony's inspiration, but the abrupt switch might slightly disrupt coherence.

Another potential issue is the quote "Do from lad primer..." which is unclear and breaks the flow, affecting both fluency and coherence. But since Coherence is about the overall structure, the main problem is the abrupt transition between sections and maybe some repetitive emphasis on his skills without clear links. However, the overall narrative is mostly clear, so Coherence might score around 4, but the abrupt transitions and the confusing sentence might bring it down to 3.5.

Wait, the scale for Coherence 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The transitions are a bit weak, and there's one very confusing part, but the rest holds together. So maybe Coherence is 4, and Fluency is 3.5 due to the two major errors.

But let me double-check. For Fluency, the two errors are significant. The first jumbled sentence is hard to read, and the second is completely incomprehensible. These are more than minor issues, so Fluency might be 3. The rest of the text is well-written, but those errors are noticeable and disrupt reading. 

Coherence: The structure is generally clear, but there are some jumps. For example, after the wood collection, it moves to the schoolteacher without a clear link. Also, the poem excerpts, while relevant, might feel like interruptions if not well integrated. However, they do support the theme, so maybe it's still coherent enough for a 4.

So finalizing: Fluency 3.5 (because despite good overall writing, there are two significant errors), Coherence 4 (mostly coherent with some minor jumps).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severe sentence fragmentation ("Anthony its over...") causing unintelligibility.  
- [LEXICON] Incomprehensible word order ("Do from lad primer...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from wood discovery to schoolteacherâ€™s visit without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Overly opaque sentence ("Do from lad primer...") disrupting narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
