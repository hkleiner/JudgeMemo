Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence of the given text.

Starting with Fluency. The text is from an older style, probably early 20th century judging by the language and structure. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. Checking for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I notice that the grammar is mostly correct, but the sentence structure is quite formal and archaic. Words like "whilom" and phrases like "the said Thomas Becket" are a bit antiquated. There's also some repetition, like mentioning the destruction of Becket's shrine multiple times, but that's more about coherence. The main fluency issue is the complex, old-fashioned syntax that might make it hard for modern readers to follow quickly. No major errors, though, so it's not severely flawed. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues due to style.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between historical events and the author's reflections on modern pilgrims. In Chapter I, there's a transition from the 1538 events to discussing twentieth-century pilgrims, then to the view from Harbledown. It feels a bit disconnectedâ€”historical facts, then a commentary on modern travel methods, then scenic description. Chapter II starts with a clear purpose to discuss Canterbury's history before Becket, but the shift from Chapter I to II might be abrupt without the context of the whole book. Within Chapter II, the historical narrative is logical, moving from Roman to Saxon periods. However, the connection between the chapters could be smoother. Also, some paragraphs are dense with historical details that might confuse without prior knowledge. The main coherence issues are transitions between ideas and assuming some background knowledge. Not severely incoherent, but some noticeable shifts. Maybe a 4 as well because it's mostly coherent but has some weaker connections.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex, archaic sentence structures (e.g., "It would be a mistake to imagine...") - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "whilom," "travel-soiled")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from historical narrative (Chapter I) to modern commentary - [STRUCTURE] Assumed historical context without clear connections for unfamiliar readers  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
