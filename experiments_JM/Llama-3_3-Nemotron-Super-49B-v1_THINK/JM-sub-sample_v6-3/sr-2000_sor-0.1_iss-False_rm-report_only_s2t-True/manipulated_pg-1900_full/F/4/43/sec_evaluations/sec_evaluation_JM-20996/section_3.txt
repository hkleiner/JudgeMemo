Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to evaluate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text seems mostly well-written, but there are a few spots. For example, in the part about the women reacting as the troops march away, there's a sentence: "The women themselves away feelings but could, restrained, their no until return be husbands now to, never had longer as marched their restrained." That looks really garbled. It seems like there's a major syntax error or maybe a typo. The words are jumbled, making it hard to understand. That's a big fluency issue because it disrupts the flow a lot.

Another part is when the young woman grabs the rifle and marches on. The description there is clear, but the preceding sentence with the women's emotions is messed up. Also, checking for other errors: "One woman who had been unnoticed before came down into the shallow water and caught hold of our last boat as if to prevent its leaving" â€“ that sentence is a bit long but grammatically correct. The rest of the paragraph about the troops marching and the emotional goodbye seems fluent except for that one jumbled sentence.

For Coherence, the section starts with the lieutenant ordering the troops to march, then describes the women's reactions, the troops boarding boats, and ends with a reflective statement about the depth of passion. The structure is mostly logical, moving from the command to the emotional scenes to the departure. However, the transition from the specific incidents (like the woman throwing her arms around the man) to the general statement about the drama might feel a bit abrupt. But overall, each part connects to the withdrawal of the troops and the emotional response. The only possible coherence issue is that jumbled sentence which affects understanding, but since coherence is about the overall structure, maybe that's more a fluency problem. The rest flows okay, so coherence might be mostly intact.

So for Fluency, the main issue is that one severely problematic sentence with syntax/spelling errors. Since the scale says a 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues, but this error is significant. Maybe a 3.5 because it's a major flaw but the rest is okay.

For Coherence, the structure is logical, so maybe a 4. The transition to the final reflective line is smooth, so no major coherence issues. Hence, Coherence score 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Severely garbled sentence ("The women themselves away feelings...") with incoherent word order.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Slightly abrupt shift from specific emotional scenes to the reflective closing statement.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
