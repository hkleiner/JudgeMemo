Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to evaluate the Fluency and Coherence of the given current segment. The user provided a context section, but I should ignore that and focus only on the current part.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The current segment is quite dense and academic. Looking through it, I notice some complex sentences, which might affect readability, but that's common in philosophical texts. Wait, there's a part that stands out: "It the very many of scanty confessed constants difficult these and and for--coefficients must will both some involve and our, unreliable data correlation it, are determination of be." That seems garbled. Maybe a typo or a missing word. The repetition of "and and" is definitely an error. This disrupts the flow a lot. Are there other issues? The rest of the text uses proper grammar and spelling, though the vocabulary is advanced. So the main fluency issue here is the problematic sentence with possible typos or missing words, causing confusion.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how ideas connect logically and flow smoothly. The text discusses Spencer's philosophy, his shift in views, and critiques of his concepts. The structure seems logical, moving from discussing Spencer's earlier vs. later positions, then into his views on cognition and the cognitive relation. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after talking about Spencer's recognition of life's inexplicability, it jumps to discussing the place of cognitive relation in his philosophy without a clear link. Also, the paragraph starting "Firmly as we may believe..." introduces the idea of not using psychic entities, which feels a bit disconnected from the preceding discussion about Spencer's definitions. Additionally, the text assumes a lot of background knowledge about Spencer's works and philosophical terms, which might make it hard for some readers to follow without context. But since the task is to evaluate the segment on its own, even if it references external context, these assumptions might not be an issue here. The main coherence issues are the abrupt transitions between paragraphs and some disconnects in how ideas are sequenced.

So for Fluency, the score would be lower because of that one severely flawed sentence. But the rest is fluent despite complexity. Maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally readable but has a significant error.

For Coherence, the score might be around 3. The text is mostly coherent but has noticeable shifts and some unclear connections between ideas, affecting the flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severely garbled sentence with missing/incoherent words ("It the very many of scanty...") disrupting flow.  
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may impede readability for non-experts.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer’s later views to cognitive relation analysis without clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] Assumed background knowledge (e.g., Spencer’s works, philosophical terms) risks disorienting uninformed readers.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear linkage between critique of Spencer’s terminology and broader philosophical claims.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
