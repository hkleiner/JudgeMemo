Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and historical, which might have complex sentences. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through, the sentences are long but structured. I notice a few places where the wording is a bit awkward, like "All did as the in the instead went popularity..." which seems jumbled. Also, "the saint pilgrims not, its numbers through reach martyrdom and receded came off of until of the century." That part doesn't make sense grammatically. Maybe a typo or missing words. There's also "the little walled city saw many great functions apart from the yearly stream of pilgrims of every grade of society," which is a bit wordy but not necessarily an error. Another spot: "at the end of a most pleasing perspective stands the West Gate..." – "perspective" might be intended as "prospect," but not a major error. Some sentences are very long, like the one describing the Cathedral's appearance, which could affect fluency but are still understandable. So Fluency issues would include some awkward phrasing, possible typos, and overly complex sentences. But overall, it's mostly fluent, so maybe a 4 or 4.5.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between different time periods and events. For example, after discussing the fire and reconstruction, it moves to the translation of Becket's remains in 1220, then to festivals every fifty years, then to royal visits, then to architectural changes in the 14th and 15th centuries, and finally to the decline and Elizabeth's visit. These transitions might be a bit abrupt. The paragraph about the city's decline and the comparison to Stratford-on-Avon feels a bit disconnected. Also, the last part starting with "CHAPTER: CHAPTER III" seems like a new section, but the text continues describing the city's appearance, which might not fully connect to the previous historical narrative. However, each paragraph generally connects to the overall topic of Canterbury Cathedral's history and significance. The main issue is the abrupt shifts between different historical events without clear transitions. So Coherence might score around 3.5 or 4, considering the topic changes but overall thematic coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in sentences (e.g., "All did as the in the instead went popularity...").  
- [SPELLING/TYPO] Possible missing/erroneous words (e.g., "came off of until of the century").  
- [LEXICON] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., lengthy descriptive passages).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical events (e.g., fire reconstruction → 1220 translation → 14th-century architecture).  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden genre shift to descriptive tourism passage ("CHAPTER III" section) without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrases (e.g., "the glamour which the old city has for the writer").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
