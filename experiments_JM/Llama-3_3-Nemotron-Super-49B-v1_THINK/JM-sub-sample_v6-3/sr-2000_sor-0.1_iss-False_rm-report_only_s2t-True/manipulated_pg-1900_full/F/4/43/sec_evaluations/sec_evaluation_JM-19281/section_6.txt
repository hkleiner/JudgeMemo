Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Let me read through the current segment carefully. The text seems complex with long sentences and theological terms. I notice a few potential issues. For example, in the sentence: "and invisible Now glory unto, wise, ever, and King ever only, eternal the for be God immortal honour the." This looks garbled, possibly a typo or misplaced words. That's definitely a fluency issue under SPELLING or SYNTAX. 

Another part: "Sadly, disciplining understanding a vital attach such primary women the impulse feature moral of blame easy made of to sexual failure in, the it for to deplorably advancement." This sentence is very confusing. The word order is off, and it's hard to parse. Maybe a missing word or incorrect structure here. That's a SYNTAX problem.

Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, like the one starting with "The succession of revelations..." which has multiple clauses. While not strictly errors, they might affect fluency. But the scale says minor issues for a 4. Since there are clear errors (like the garbled sentence and the confusing one at the end), but the rest is mostly readable, maybe a 3.5? Because there are noticeable issues but the text is generally readable.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connections between ideas. The text discusses the unity of religious teachings, succession of prophets, and critiques of religious interpretations. The structure seems to follow a logical path, connecting various scriptures and explaining their unity. However, there's a sudden shift in the last paragraph ("Confusion about the role of religion...") which talks about women's status. This feels somewhat abrupt compared to the previous discussion on religious unity. That's a TRANSITION issue. Also, the very last sentence "Sadly, disciplining..." is not only fluent but also seems out of place or incomplete, disrupting coherence.

But overall, the main themes are well-connected, so maybe a 4? Because there's a minor transition issue and one confusing part, but mostly coherent.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING/SYNTAX] Incoherent word sequence ("and invisible Now glory...").
- [SYNTAX] Illogical sentence structure ("Sadly, disciplining understanding...").

2) Coherence Issues:

- [CLARITY] Incomprehensible sentence at end disrupting flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
