Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text seems to be a passage from a literary work, probably from the late 19th or early 20th century given the style. The language is formal and complex, with long sentences. I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation issues.

Reading through the current segment, the sentences are structured correctly. There are no obvious spelling mistakes. The vocabulary is sophisticated but appropriate. However, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, which might affect fluency. For example, the part where the narrator describes his interaction with Corvick and the subsequent thoughts has multiple clauses stacked together. This could make the flow a bit challenging for some readers, but given the era's writing style, it's somewhat expected. Still, modern readers might find these lengthy sentences a bit cumbersome.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect, logical progression, transitions, etc. The segment starts with a conversation between the narrator and Vereker, then moves to the narrator's actions (collecting books, talking to Corvick), receives a note from Vereker, and then another meeting. The transitions between these scenes seem logical. Each part follows from the previous: the conversation leads to the narrator's failed search, which leads to discussing with Corvick, then Vereker's note, and the visit. However, there's a shift from the narrator's personal struggle to the interaction with Corvick and then back to Vereker. The transitions are handled with phrases like "RETURNING to town" and "On the very day after," which help connect the sections. But the jump from the narrator's boredom with the books to telling Corvick might feel a bit abrupt without the context of the previous section, but since we're evaluating this segment alone, it's manageable. The ideas are mostly connected, though the narrative spans different locations and characters, which might slightly disrupt coherence for some readers.

For Fluency score: The text is mostly fluent, with complex but correct sentences. The long sentences might cause minor issues but don't disrupt readability much. So maybe a 4 or 4.5. Considering the style is outdated but intentional, I'll lean towards 4.5 because the language, while complex, doesn't have errors.

For Coherence score: The narrative flows logically, but there are several scene changes (library, meeting Corvick, receiving the note, visiting Vereker again). The connections are clear with transitional phrases, but the multiple shifts might make it slightly less cohesive. So perhaps a 4, as it's mostly coherent with a few minor disconnects.

Checking the criteria again: Fluency 4.5 because it's mostly fluent with minor stylistic challenges. Coherence 4 because while mostly logical, the multiple scene transitions without stronger connectors might cause slight coherence issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally lengthy, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Multiple scene transitions (e.g., narrator’s reflection → Corvick → Vereker’s note → visit) rely on minimal transitional cues.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
