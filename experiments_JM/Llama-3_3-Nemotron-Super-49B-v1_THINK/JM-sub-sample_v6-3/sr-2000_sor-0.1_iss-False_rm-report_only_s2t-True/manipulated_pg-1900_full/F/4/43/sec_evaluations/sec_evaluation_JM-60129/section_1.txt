Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the fluency and coherence of the given text segment. The text is a historical or travelogue piece, probably from an older work given the style and vocabulary.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite formal and uses complex sentences. I notice some long, winding sentences that might affect readability. For example, the sentence about the temple's location and the description of the women's appearance are lengthy. There's also a part with unclear structure: "Some north probably of been to them the brought have Mongolian said origin of were were and from." That seems garbled, maybe a typo or mistranslation. Also, words like "telescoped" aren't commonly used, which might cause a hiccup. Grammar-wise, most seems correct, but there's a possible subject-verb issue in "The contributions of the villagers... are very insignificant" if "contributions" is plural but treated as singular. Spelling check: "beatiful" should be "beautiful". 

For coherence, the narrative jumps between describing the landscape, interacting with locals, and then delving into the village's history and administrative details. Transitions could be smoother. For instance, moving from the temple description to the legend about their origins feels abrupt. There's also some repetition in mentioning the village names and locations without clear connections. The text assumes some background knowledge, like the significance of different Yögur groups and their languages, which might confuse readers without context. However, overall, the structure is mostly logical, even if dense.

So, for fluency issues: The main problems are syntax (long sentences), lexicon (archaic words), spelling ("beatiful"), and a major syntax error in that one jumbled sentence. 

For coherence: Structure issues with abrupt transitions, lack of clarity in explanations (like the language similarities), and assumptions of prior knowledge. But it's generally coherent despite these.

Scoring fluency: Mostly fluent but with noticeable issues. Maybe a 4? But the jumbled sentence is serious. Wait, the scale says 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues. The syntax error is more than minor, so maybe 3.5? Because there are multiple issues but the text is still readable.

Coherence: Some disjointed parts but overall logical. Maybe a 4, since the main flow is there but with some weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentences (e.g., "At dawn on December 13th...").  
- [SPELLING] "beatiful" (should be "beautiful").  
- [SYNTAX] Garbled, unintelligible phrase ("Some north probably of been to them...").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("telescoped," "barbarian").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from landscape description to village legend.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of Yögur subgroups and linguistic distinctions.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive location listings (e.g., village names) without clear contextual integration.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
