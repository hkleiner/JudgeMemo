Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess both Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few spots. For example, there's a sentence: "The was artist all ideal with fully and at by had admirably, this command resources time his imbued his." That seems garbled. Maybe a typo or missing words. Also, some long sentences might affect flow, but they're structured correctly. The rest of the text has proper grammar and spelling, so the main issue here is that one jumbled sentence which disrupts fluency.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas connect logically. The segment starts by addressing a reality (Meissonier's work) countering an abstract argument. Then it lists his paintings, discusses a deviation in style, mentions criticism and success, quotes Gautier, and explains Meissonier's artistic qualities. The structure seems logical: introducing the work, discussing a brief deviation, then his success and what made his art coherent. However, the transition from talking about his success to quoting Gautier might feel a bit abrupt. Also, the part where it says "The was artist..." is not only a fluency issue but could confuse the narrative flow if not corrected. But overall, the ideas connect well, with each part building on the previous. The quote from Gautier supports the point about individuality, so it's relevant. Maybe minor transitions could be smoother, but no major disconnects.

So for Fluency, the main problem is the garbled sentence (SYNTAX and possibly LEXICON if words are missing). For Coherence, maybe a slight abruptness in transitioning to the quote, but it's minor. 

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly fluent except for that one major error. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly well-structured but has a noticeable issue. 

Coherence: The structure is logical, ideas flow, even if some transitions are slight. So maybe a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Garbled sentence ("The was artist...") with unclear structure and missing/incoherent words.  
- [LEXICON] Possible missing vocabulary or typographical error in the same sentence.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting from Meissonierâ€™s success narrative to the Gautier quote (though contextually relevant).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
