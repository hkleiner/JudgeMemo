Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given scales.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The text seems mostly well-written, but there are a few spots. For example, in the line "But Ches be to was not denied." That looks like a typo; probably should be "But Ches was not to be denied." That's a syntax error. Also, "boy attachment" might be a typo for "boy's attachment" or just incorrect wording. There's "extries" which should be "exteriors" maybe, but the context is a child speaking, so it might be intentional as a dialect. However, since it's part of dialogue, it might be considered a lexical choice rather than an error. Another possible issue is "N'york" which should be "New York", but again, in dialogue, it's possible as a colloquialism. 

For Coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically. The segment starts with Jim and the deer fight, then transitions to Ches's involvement, the aftermath, and then shifts to a conversation between Jim and Bud about the boy's father. The transition from the fight scene to the later conversation might feel a bit abrupt, especially when it jumps to the next day or another time without clear transition markers. However, since it's a chapter segment, some transitions might be expected. The part where Bud talks about the inspector and the mail route seems a bit disconnected from the main story about the boy's father, but it's part of the dialogue and might serve to characterize Bud. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are the "be to" error and possibly "boy attachment". For Coherence, the abrupt transition between scenes and maybe some unclear connections in Bud's storytelling. 

Scoring Fluency: The errors are minor but noticeable. The text is mostly fluent, so maybe a 4. The syntax error in "Ches be" is a bit jarring, but the rest flows well. 

Coherence: The story mostly holds together, but the transitions could be smoother. The conversation between Jim and Bud introduces new information that's relevant but the shift from the action scene to the dialogue might cause a slight disconnect. So maybe a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "But Ches be to was not denied" (incorrect verb sequence, should be "was not to be denied")  
- [LEXICON] "boy attachment" (likely typo for "boy's attachment" or unclear phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from action scene to Jim-Bud conversation without clear temporal connector  
- [STRUCTURE] Bud’s inspector anecdote feels tangentially connected to the boy’s father subplot  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
