Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the Fluency and Coherence of the given text segment based on specific criteria. I have to follow strict formatting and only provide bullet points for issues without explanations.

Starting with Fluency. The text is a descriptive piece about a cathedral, likely from an older work given the style. I'll read through the current segment carefully. 

Looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon issues. The writing is formal and complex, with long sentences. Let me check for errors. The sentence "It of had the had a. amount been nave be, taken rebuilding fitting IV his the considerable here in and that liberal for interest he, of in Henry financial was buried should aid." stands out. It seems garbled with repeated words and unclear structure. That's a clear syntax and grammar issue. 

Other parts have complex sentences but seem mostly correct. Words like "reticulated stonework" and "consummate skill" show good lexicon. However, there's a possible typo in "CrÃ©cy" (should be Crécy with an accent, but maybe the encoding is off). Also, "latten" might be less common, but it's a valid term. The main fluency problem is that one garbled sentence which disrupts flow. Otherwise, the text is mostly fluent with some minor phrasing that's a bit awkward but not distracting. So Fluency score might be around 4, considering the one major error but overall good structure.

Now Coherence. The text describes various parts of the cathedral, monuments, history. The structure seems logical, moving from one part to another. However, there are abrupt transitions. For example, after discussing the north-west transept and Becket's martyrdom, it jumps to the undercroft steps and then to St. Michael's Chapel without clear connectors. Also, the paragraph about Archbishop Howley's opposition to the Reform Bill feels somewhat disconnected from the architectural descriptions around it. The text assumes a lot of background knowledge (e.g., Chaucer, specific historical figures) which might cause clarity issues for some readers. Despite this, the overall narrative is mostly coherent with a clear tour-like progression. So Coherence score might be 3.5, as there are noticeable shifts but the main flow is maintained.

Wait, let me double-check. The section on Archbishop Howley does contrast with the preceding architectural details, but it's presented as a historical anecdote related to the location. Maybe that's a logical inclusion. The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, but each paragraph itself is coherent. The main issues are the lack of explicit transitions between some ideas and assumed knowledge. So maybe Coherence is a 4? But the abrupt jumps and some unclear connections might bring it down to 3.5. 

Finalizing: Fluency has one major error but otherwise good, so 4. Coherence has some transitions and clarity issues, so 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Garbled sentence structure ("It of had the had a. amount...") with repeated words and incoherent phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] Potential encoding error in "CrÃ©cy" (should be "Crécy").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing architectural features to Archbishop Howley's historical anecdote without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of historical figures (e.g., Stephen Langton, Chaucer) without contextualization.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
