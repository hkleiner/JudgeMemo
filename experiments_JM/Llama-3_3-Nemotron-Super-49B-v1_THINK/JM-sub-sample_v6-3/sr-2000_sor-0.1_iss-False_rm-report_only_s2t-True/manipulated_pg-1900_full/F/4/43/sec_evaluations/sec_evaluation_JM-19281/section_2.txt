Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, the text seems well-structured with complex sentences. However, there are a few points to note. For example, the sentence "Consumer gospel, culturegoals inheritor of that by naturebetterment the 's of by, 's today inspire materialism unembarrassed human the of default is ephemeral it." looks garbled. It has unclear phrasing and possibly missing or misplaced words, which disrupts fluency. Another area is the use of long, convoluted sentences. While they are grammatically correct, their complexity might make the text harder to follow for some readers. Also, there's a mix of philosophical and technical terms without clear explanations, which could affect readability for non-experts.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect and the overall logical flow. The current segment discusses the failure of materialism and the impact of global integration. The ideas seem to flow logically, connecting the critique of materialism to its consequences and then introducing global integration as another force. However, there's a shift from materialism's critique to global integration without a very smooth transition. The paragraph about global integration starts abruptly. Also, the inclusion of Bahá'í references (like the quote about the Physician) might not be clearly connected for readers unfamiliar with the context, causing minor coherence issues.

For Fluency score: The main issues are the garbled sentence and complex sentence structures. But overall, the text is mostly fluent with minor issues, so a 4 might be appropriate.

For Coherence score: The transitions between paragraphs could be better, and some references might confuse readers, but the overall flow is logical. So maybe a 4 as well, but need to check if the transition issues warrant a 3.5. Since the ideas are generally well-connected except for the abrupt shift and some unclear links, perhaps 4 is still right because the disruptions aren't severe.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Garbled sentence structure ("Consumer gospel...") with unclear phrasing and potential missing/misplaced words. - [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary and sentence length may hinder readability for non-specialized audiences.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from critique of materialism to discussion of global integration without clear connective tissue. - [CLARITY] Unexplained Bahá'í references (e.g., "the Physician") may confuse unfamiliar readers.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
