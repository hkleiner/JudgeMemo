Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is quite long, so I'll need to scan through for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the text, the sentences are complex and long, which might affect readability, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue unless they're unclear. I notice a few potential spots. For example, the sentence starting with "So it has been throughout all of the religious dispensations..." is a bit convoluted. Also, there's a part that says "the power of moral conviction that can implement them, a power whose only demonstrably reliable source throughout history has been religious faith." That's a bit of a mouthful, but still grammatically correct. 

Wait, there's a sentence: "Most of these principles are, alas, also widely flouted, not only among recognized enemies of social peace, but in circles professedly committed to them." The structure here seems okay, maybe a bit formal but fluent. 

Checking for any grammatical errors. The text seems mostly error-free. However, there's a part where it says, "the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether"—should be "judgments" (one 'g'?), but that's a minor spelling variation, possibly a style choice. 

Another point: "Through His revelation, the principles required for the collective coming of age of the human race have been invested with the one power capable of penetrating to the roots of human motivation and of altering behaviour." The structure is complex but correct. 

So for Fluency, the main issues might be the complexity of sentences leading to slightly reduced readability, but no major errors. Maybe a score of 4 or 4.5. Let's say 4.5 because while it's dense, it's well-structured without errors.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas flow and connect. The segment starts by discussing modern attitudes towards religious teachings, then moves through historical examples (Hebrew people, Muhammad's community), discusses penalties in sacred texts, and then transitions into Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and their relevance. 

The flow seems logical: each paragraph builds on the previous, discussing historical context, then the shift to modern needs, and the role of Bahá'u'lláh's principles. However, there might be a slight jump when moving from the historical examples to the contemporary application, but transitions like "The issue is not the past, but the implications for the present" help connect them. 

Another potential issue is the quote from Bahá'u'lláh introduced without prior mention in this segment (though the context section might have set it up). But since we're evaluating this segment alone, the introduction of the quote might feel a bit abrupt. However, the explanation follows, so it's manageable. 

The part where it discusses the presidents and Gandhi might feel like a slight tangent, but it's used to illustrate the waning influence of traditional religions, leading into Bahá'u'lláh's relevance. 

Overall, the coherence is strong, with each section logically leading to the next. Maybe a minor deduction for the density of ideas or the abrupt quote, but overall a high score, like 4.5.

Wait, but looking back, the transition from talking about historical religious penalties to Bahá'u'lláh's principles might not be perfectly smooth. Let me check: The paragraph before the Bahá'u'lláh quote discusses how religions addressed certain issues while ignoring others, then says "The issue is not the past, but the implications for the present. Problems arise where followers..." which leads into the need for distinguishing eternal vs. transitory features. Then the quote is introduced to explain the new age's requirements. The connection is there, but maybe a bit of a leap without a clearer bridge. However, given the context allowed, it's manageable. 

So Coherence score might be 4.5 as well, but maybe 4 if the transitions are considered slightly weak in places. But overall, the structure is well-organized.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Minor abruptness in introducing Bahá'u'lláh’s quote without explicit prior contextualization within the segment.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
