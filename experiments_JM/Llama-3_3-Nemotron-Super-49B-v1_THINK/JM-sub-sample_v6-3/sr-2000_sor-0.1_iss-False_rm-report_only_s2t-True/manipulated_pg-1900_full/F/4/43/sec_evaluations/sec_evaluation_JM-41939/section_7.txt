Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately using the given scales.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. The text seems well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. The sentences flow smoothly. For example, "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity." That's a complex sentence but structured correctly. I notice a few places where the phrasing might be a bit formal or old-fashioned, like "the end came in a few days" or "without a dissenting note." But these aren't errors; they're just stylistic choices. Maybe "innumerable cortège" could be "innumerable cortège" – wait, "cortège" is correctly spelled here. No obvious grammar or spelling mistakes. So Fluency is high. Maybe a 5? But let me check again. The transition between paragraphs is smooth. Each paragraph has a clear topic: the painting's reception, her death, the funeral. No awkward phrasing that disrupts flow. So Fluency score is 5.

Now Coherence. The segment starts talking about her painting at the Salon, then moves to her death, the press's tribute, and her funeral. Each part logically follows. The ideas are connected: her late success, her unexpected death, the mourning. There's a clear progression from life event to death to aftermath. Transitions are smooth; for example, "when a congestion of the lungs prostrated her" links her health to her demise. The only possible issue might be the shift from discussing the painting to her death, but it's contextual since the painting was a recent event before her death. No abrupt jumps or inconsistencies. The structure is logical and easy to follow. So Coherence is also 5.

Wait, but the Coherence scale mentions "logically sequenced" and "smoothly connected ideas." The text moves from the painting's success to her death, which is a natural sequence in a biographical context. Then the reaction to her death follows logically. No gaps or confusion. So both metrics should be 5.
