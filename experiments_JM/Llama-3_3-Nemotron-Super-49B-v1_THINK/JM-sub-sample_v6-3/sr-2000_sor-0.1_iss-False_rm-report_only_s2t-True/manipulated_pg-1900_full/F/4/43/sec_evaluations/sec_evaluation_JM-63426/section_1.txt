Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of the given text based on the provided criteria.

First, I'll look at the Fluency. The text is mostly readable, but there are some issues. The first thing I notice is the sentence structure. Some sentences are quite long and convoluted, like the ones describing Bradley's impact and his career. For example, "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free, and from that springboard he took off into a career..." That's a bit of a run-on. Also, there are a few places where the word choice might be a bit archaic or less common, like "corn-fed American" or "lusty, democratic ambition." These aren't errors per se, but they might make the text slightly less smooth for modern readers. However, overall, the grammar and spelling seem correct. So Fluency would be a 4 because it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now for Coherence. The text starts with an introduction to Will Bradley, talks about his work's impact, then jumps into a biographical sketch that seems disjointed. The transition from discussing Bradley's artistic contributions to the sudden shift into a childhood story (starting with "CHAPTER: THE on Lynn Massachusetts is...") is abrupt. There's no clear connection explained between the two sections. The biographical part has its own coherence within itself, with a chronological narrative, but the link between the two chapters is missing. So the main issue is the abrupt transition and lack of connection between the two parts. That would affect Coherence, maybe a 3 because it's generally coherent within each part but has a major disconnect between them.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "He discovered American colonial typography...").  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "corn-fed," "lusty").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unexplained transition between the introductory analysis of Bradleyâ€™s work and the biographical childhood narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connection between the two thematic sections ("CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION" and "CHAPTER: THE on Lynn Massachusetts is...").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
