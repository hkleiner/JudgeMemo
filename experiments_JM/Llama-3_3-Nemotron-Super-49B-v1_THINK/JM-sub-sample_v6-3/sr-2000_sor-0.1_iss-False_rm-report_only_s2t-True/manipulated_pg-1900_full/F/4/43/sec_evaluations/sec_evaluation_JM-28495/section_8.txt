Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully. The narrative seems to flow well overall. The sentences are structured properly, and I don't notice any major grammar or spelling errors. The language is descriptive, like the tramp's appearance and the dog's actions. However, there are a couple of places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "a class all too numerous on the outskirts of the great industrial parish of Smeltingborough" is a long phrase that could be smoother. Also, the line "except that when Eileen said 'in' she meant 'up'" feels like a slight interruption in the flow, but it's a narrative comment, so maybe intentional. Still, it's a minor issue. Mostly, the text is fluent with minor, non-distracting issues. So Fluency score would be 4.

Now for Coherence. The story unfolds logically: tramp arrives, interacts with the lady, she gets the dog, tramp leaves. Each part connects well. The introduction of the dog is a bit sudden, but it's explained that Eileen went into the house and came back with it. The humor about the dog's name (Excalibur) and the comment about "in" vs "up" adds to the coherence by showing character and situation logic. There's a clear progression from the tramp's request to his departure. No abrupt jumps or confusing segments. So Coherence score is 5.

Wait, but the dog's introductionâ€”does that feel abrupt? The text says Eileen disappears into the house and returns with the dog. The transition is handled with "The next moment there were footsteps..." which connects the actions. So it's coherent. Hence, no major coherence issues. 

Double-checking the scales: Fluency 4 because mostly fluent with minor issues. Coherence 5 because highly coherent with all elements connecting smoothly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward phrasing in descriptive passages (e.g., "a class all too numerous..."). - [LEXICON] Minor narrative interruptions (e.g., explanatory asides like "in" vs "up").  
2) Coherence Issues: - None identified.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
