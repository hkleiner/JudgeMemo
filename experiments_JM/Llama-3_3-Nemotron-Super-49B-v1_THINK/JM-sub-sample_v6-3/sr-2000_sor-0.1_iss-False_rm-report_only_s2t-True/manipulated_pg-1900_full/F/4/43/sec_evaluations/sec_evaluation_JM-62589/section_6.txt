Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the Current Segment, I notice a few things. There's a part where the text says "A as neared over him he dizziness came strange his destination." That looks like a jumbled sentence. Maybe a typo or misplaced words. Also, in another spot: "the weariness horse, too forgetting dashed took and its fright ahead." The word order here is confusing. "Weariness horse" doesn't make sense; probably should be "tired horse" or similar. There are also some punctuation issues, like missing articles or incorrect commas, but they're not too distracting. The rest of the text mostly flows okay, though there are some awkward phrasings, like "Wrapped in the costume of two countries" which is a bit unclear without context. But overall, the errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt reading. So Fluency might be around a 3.5 because while there are issues, they don't make it unreadable.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect and the logical flow. The segment starts with Shirtliffe leaving, then there's a scene with him riding, encountering a sentry, delivering news, and then a conversation with Martin. The transition from him riding to arriving at the camp seems a bit abrupt. For example, after "A as neared..." which is confusing, it jumps to him being stopped by a sentry without much buildup. Also, when he meets Martin, the conversation feels a bit forced, especially the part where Robert starts crying and explains his situation. The emotional shift might feel sudden. However, the overall narrative is mostly clear. The main issue is some abrupt transitions and unclear connections between scenes, but the story still follows logically. So Coherence might be a 3 because there are noticeable issues in transitions but the overall structure holds.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentence structure ("A as neared over him he dizziness came strange his destination").  
- [LEXICON] Confusing word choice ("weariness horse" instead of "tired horse").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("Wrapped in the costume of two countries").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from riding to encountering the sentry without contextual bridge.  
- [CLARITY] Sudden emotional intensity (Robertâ€™s crying scene) feels disconnected from preceding dialogue.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sentence ("the weariness horse...") disrupts narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*Fluency*: Mostly readable but with notable syntactic and lexical errors.  
*Coherence*: Generally logical but with abrupt transitions and unclear emotional shifts.
