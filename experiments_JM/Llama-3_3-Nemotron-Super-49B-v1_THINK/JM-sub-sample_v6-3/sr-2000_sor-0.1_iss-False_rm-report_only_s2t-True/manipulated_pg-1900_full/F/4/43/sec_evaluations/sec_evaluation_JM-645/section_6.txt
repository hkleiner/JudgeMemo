Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking at the current segment, there are some parts that are a bit confusing. For example, the sentence "This dance scruple a to was; beautiful of me time to sheout an, led sign second my, even Jane spite me me make kept me a made as decline when a seat good her bad in so, house of ’s manners invitation Lady." This seems garbled with words out of order and unclear meaning. That's definitely a syntax and grammar issue. Also, phrases like "Corvick line fact ’s, the be, his accepting with but not his knew, brother task apt hand it-was-acorrespondent that, big I for himself to exactly a had for in brush was reason particular law the affair the no of that in was and." These are jumbled and hard to parse. There might be missing words or incorrect punctuation. So, multiple grammar and syntax errors here.

For Coherence, the text jumps around a bit. There's a mention of Corvick going to India, then a conversation about his engagement, and then a telegram from Gwendolen. The transitions between these sections aren't very smooth. For instance, the shift from discussing Corvick's job to his personal relationship feels abrupt without clear connections. Also, some parts are repetitive or unclear, like the analogy with the roulette table and the temples of chance. The narrative doesn't flow logically at all points, causing some confusion.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the text being mostly readable, there are several segments with severe grammatical and syntactical issues. These aren't just minor; they disrupt the flow significantly. So maybe a 2.5? Because while you can understand most of it, there are parts that are really tough.

For Coherence, the overall structure has some logical gaps and abrupt transitions. The ideas aren't always well-connected, making it hard to follow without effort. But it's not completely incoherent. Maybe a 3? Because you can generally follow the main points, but the connections between sections are weak.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severely jumbled sentences (e.g., "This dance scruple a to was...") with illogical word order.  
- [GRAMMAR] Repeated grammatical errors (e.g., "Corvick line fact ’s...") and missing/incoherent phrases.  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing ("the stake on the table was of a special substance") disrupting clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions (e.g., Corvick’s job → personal relationship → telegram plot reveal).  
- [LOGIC] Unresolved ambiguities (e.g., unclear connection between Corvick’s assignment and Vereker’s idea).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of logical flow between paragraphs (e.g., "I got hold of ‘Deep Down’ again..." feels disconnected).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **2.5**
