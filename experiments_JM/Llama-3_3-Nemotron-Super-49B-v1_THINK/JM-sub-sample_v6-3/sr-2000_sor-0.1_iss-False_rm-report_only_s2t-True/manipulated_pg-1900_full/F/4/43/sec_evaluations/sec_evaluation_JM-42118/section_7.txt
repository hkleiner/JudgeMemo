Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given scales. 

Starting with Fluency. The text seems mostly well-written, but I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and flow. Scanning through, I notice some complex sentences, but they seem structured correctly. However, there are a few places where the sentence structure might be a bit awkward. For example, "The man and woman were of like tastes, of like temperaments; it was, likely enough, little more than that." The semicolon here might make the transition a bit abrupt. Also, "Ugly scandals got abroad--scandals difficult to prove or disprove." The phrase "got abroad" is a bit informal and might disrupt the formal tone. Another point: "the vile accent of Grasse, that made his wife's speech horrible to the ear, becoming slurred into a shadow of itself on Marguerite's tongue, and turned by the enchanting accents of the younger sister's lips into seduction." This sentence is quite long and has multiple clauses; while it's poetic, it might cause a slight pause in reading. 

For Coherence, the narrative moves through various historical events and Fragonard's personal life. The connection between his life events and the Revolution seems logical, but there are jumps between describing his family, the political context, and historical figures. For instance, the transition from Fragonard's loss of his daughter to the broader political upheaval might feel a bit abrupt without clearer linking. Also, the introduction of multiple historical figures (Mirabeau, Lafayette, Robespierre, etc.) in quick succession could make the narrative feel a bit disjointed for someone not familiar with the timeline. 

So for Fluency, despite some minor awkwardness and long sentences, the text is generally fluent. Maybe a 4? But the awkward phrases might deduct a bit, so 4.5 seems too high. Let's say 4.

For Coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions between personal and historical events, and the rapid introduction of many figures without clear connections. However, the overall structure follows a timeline, so it's not severely incoherent. Maybe a 3.5 because while it's mostly coherent, the shifts and lack of transitions cause some disruption.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., "The man and woman were of like tastes...")  
- [LEXICON] Informal phrasing ("got abroad") disrupting formal tone  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, pause-inducing sentence constructions  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between personal narrative and historical events  
- [STRUCTURE] Rapid, unconnected introduction of multiple historical figures  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
