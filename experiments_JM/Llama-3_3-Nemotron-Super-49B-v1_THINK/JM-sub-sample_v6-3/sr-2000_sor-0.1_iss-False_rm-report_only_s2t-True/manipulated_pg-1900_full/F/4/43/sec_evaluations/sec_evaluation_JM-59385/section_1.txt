Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. Starting with Fluency. The text is a descriptive passage with a lot of vivid imagery. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and lexical issues. 

Looking through the text, I notice some complex sentences that might be a bit awkward. For example, "Ancient into that convert she custom wealth shall household the precious father inherits bride from â€™sthe betrothed her rules stones." That part seems jumbled. Maybe a typo or misplaced words. Also, there are phrases like "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" which is a bit redundant since "passively" and "quiet" might convey the same idea. 

Another spot: "Kuei eyes under of clerks of shop center underlings the the following parchment..." This line looks garbled, possibly missing words or incorrect structure. Also, "the her, thus warmer as held life that her their might jewels into though nearness, breathed the them hand holding glow them she saw in, she girl feel into color as touch them." This paragraph is very confusing with unclear pronoun references and mixed-up sentence structure. 

For Coherence, the story seems to follow a logical sequence: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the procession, the shop visit, bargaining, and then a memory flashback. However, the transition to the memory part ("With a suddenness...") feels abrupt. The text jumps from the jewel selection to a graduation memory without a clear link. Also, some sections might be repetitive, like the repeated descriptions of the bargaining process, but it's not too bad. The main issue is that abrupt transition which disrupts the flow.

So for Fluency, the main issues are grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some incoherent sentences. For Coherence, the key problem is the abrupt transition to the memory without proper connection. 

Scoring Fluency: There are noticeable errors but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are issues, the overall flow isn't completely broken. 

Coherence: The story is generally logical but that one transition is a problem. So maybe a 4? Since most parts connect well except for that one jump.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Jumbled sentence structure (e.g., "Ancient into that convert...")  
- [LEXICON] Redundant phrasing (e.g., "sat passively quiet")  
- [SYNTAX] Garbled sentences (e.g., "Kuei eyes under of clerks...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to memory flashback without contextual bridge  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive bargaining descriptions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
