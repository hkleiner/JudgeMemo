Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the entire text for Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at each section's Fluency scores: Section 1 has 2.5, which is pretty low. The issues there are severe grammar and syntax problems, like fragmented sentences and missing articles. Then sections 2-11 vary between 3.5, 4.0, and 3.0 in section 9. The common issues across sections are syntax errors, awkward phrasing, and some typos. For example, section 02 has a severely garbled sentence, section 04 has confusing phrases, and section 09 has incoherent sentences. Even the higher-scoring sections like 3, 6, 8, 10, 11 have some syntax or lexical issues but fewer. The biggest problem is the first section dragging the overall fluency down because it's really bad. But most sections are around 3.5 to 4.0. So averaging, but considering the severe issues in section 1, maybe the overall Fluency is around 3.0? Wait, but sections 3,6,8,10,11 are 4.0. Let me count: out of 11 sections, 4 have 4.0, 3 have 3.5, 2 have 3.0 or lower (section1:2.5, section9:3.0). So maybe average is around 3.5? But the severe problems in section1 might lower it. The definition for 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues interrupting flow." Since many sections have issues but are still readable, and only section1 is really bad, maybe 3.0 for Fluency.

Now Coherence. The scores range from 3.0 in section1 to 4.0 in most others. Issues across all sections are abrupt transitions, poor connections between ideas, and some structural problems. For example, section1 has abrupt transitions, section02 has an abrupt shift, and many sections mention transitions without clear connectors. Even high-scoring sections like 2-8 have some coherence issues but not severe. Section9 has 3.5 with more significant issues. The overall coherence is mostly 4.0 in many sections but with recurring transition problems. The definition for 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." Since most sections are 4.0 but every section has at least one coherence issue, especially transitions, maybe the overall Coherence is 3.5? Because while the structure is generally there, the frequent abrupt transitions across almost all sections might bring it down from a perfect 4.0. So 3.5 for Coherence.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
