Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on fluency and coherence, using the specified criteria. First, I need to understand the metrics properly.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, etc. The scale goes from 1 (unintelligible) to 5 (highly fluent). Looking at the current segment, the text is quite dense and academic. There are long sentences with complex structures. For example, sentences like "It may be said that Spencer accepted the so-called identity hypothesis..." are long but grammatically correct. However, I notice some parts with awkward phrasing. Like the sentence "Of what, then, is there awareness? Primarily perhaps of some occurrence in the external world." The transition here feels a bit abrupt. Also, there's a part that seems garbled: "The many and that is complex relatedness point occurrence always essential to this the cognitive discussion bear is, mind its world the the of in terms in, higher natural analysis complex phases what its, of the that most probably involves relation involves of existence in." This looks like a jumbled sentence with missing or misplaced words, causing confusion. That's a clear fluency issue, probably a [SYNTAX] or [LEXICON] problem. 

For Coherence, it's about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The scale here also 1-5. The text discusses Spencer's ideas and critiques them, then moves to explaining cognitive relatedness with analogies like gravity. The structure seems logical, but there are abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing Spencer, it jumps to talking about the locus of awareness and part-whole relationships without a clear transition. The quote from Spencer at the end feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion, though it might be contextual. Also, the sentence "But who failed where, come sight measurable has of within Spencer success? We are the in to our as form beginning only a just purview it of see such bring within to to the stating way problem science." appears to be a jumbled, possibly corrupted sentence, disrupting coherence.

So for Fluency, the main issues are the garbled sentence (syntax/lexicon) and some awkward phrasing. For Coherence, the abrupt transitions and the corrupted sentence affecting logical flow. 

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly readable but has noticeable issues. The garbled part is significant but isolated. Maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally fluent but with some major disruptions.

Coherence: The ideas are mostly connected, but there are shifts without clear transitions and a corrupted sentence. Maybe a 3, since it's generally coherent but with notable disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentence structure (e.g., "The many and that is complex...").  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., abrupt transitions like "Of what, then, is there awareness?").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., Spencer critique to part-whole analogy).  
- [CLARITY] Corrupted sentence disrupting logical flow ("But who failed where...").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
