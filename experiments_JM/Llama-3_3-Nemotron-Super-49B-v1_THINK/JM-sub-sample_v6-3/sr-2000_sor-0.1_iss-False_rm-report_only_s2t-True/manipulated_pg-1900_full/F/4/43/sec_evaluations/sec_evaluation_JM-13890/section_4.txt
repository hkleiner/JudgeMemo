Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the Current Segment, I notice a few issues. For example, there's a sentence: "Taking for of front up an hot such in excuse was Canterbury own attitude-his Becket to who killing with fate determination him had the men seek foot, come express to sealing four an." This part seems garbled. The word order is off, and it's hard to parse. That's definitely a syntax and grammar problem. Maybe a [SYNTAX] and [GRAMMAR] issue here.

Another spot: "When for been stripes daily being had previous the tomb to prepared habit day shirt Becket the this was plainly marks of on in was scourging the removable the, the found administered be body of being for the easily enduring the visible." Again, the structure is confusing. Words like "for been stripes daily" don't make sense. This is both grammar and syntax. Also, possible spelling mistakes or missing words.

There are also places with awkward phrasing, like "the marvel was increased by the sight--to our notions so revolting--of the innumerable vermin..." The phrasing here is a bit awkward but not a major error. Maybe a minor [LEXICON] issue for word choice, but not sure. However, the main problems are in those garbled sentences.

For Coherence, the text mostly follows a logical sequence. It describes the events after Becket's defiance, the knights' reaction, the murder, and the aftermath. However, there are transitions that feel abrupt. For example, moving from the murder scene to the monks discovering Becket's ascetic clothing feels a bit sudden. Maybe a [TRANSITION] issue there. Also, when discussing the King's penance, the shift from his actions to the result of his fever and recovery might lack smooth connection. Another possible [STRUCTURE] issue in how different events are connected.

But overall, the narrative is mostly clear. The biggest coherence problem is the abrupt transition between some paragraphs, like from the murder to the discovery of the hair-cloth shirt. That's a [TRANSITION] problem. Also, some parts might have too much detail that disrupts the flow, but I'm not sure if that's a coherence issue or fluency.

Scoring Fluency: The text has several major syntax and grammar errors in specific sentences, making those parts hard to understand. But most of the text is well-written. So maybe a 3? Because there are multiple issues that interrupt flow, but it's generally readable.

Coherence: The story flows logically overall, but there are some abrupt transitions and maybe a bit of disjointedness in presenting different aspects (murder, canonization, King's penance). So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] [Severely garbled sentence structure (e.g., "Taking for of front up an hot...")]  
- [GRAMMAR] [Illogical word sequences (e.g., "When for been stripes daily...")]  
- [SPELLING/LEXICON] [Possible missing/spelled words (e.g., "scourging the removable the")]  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] [Abrupt shift from murder to discovery of ascetic garments]  
- [STRUCTURE] [Disjointed pacing between descriptive and narrative sections]  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **2.5**
