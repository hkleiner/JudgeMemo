Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately using the given scales. 

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The first thing I notice is a sentence that seems garbled: "The delay next shots down resting the revels dashed the morning, upon and the just others, astonished shook and were less Britishers yells butand from slight their Sullivan by one Washington o’clock opposite eight shore, command under reached with who the town, the by division fortunate their ’s Washington were under." This part is really confusing. The words are jumbled, making it hard to understand. That's a major syntax and grammar issue. Also, there are some missing articles or incorrect prepositions in other places, like "a chiller air stirred the bare trees" should probably be "a chillier air" or maybe "the chillier air," but that's minor. The main problem is that messed-up sentence which disrupts fluency a lot.

For Coherence, the text mostly follows logically, but there's a part where Robert is thinking about past memories and Debby Mason. The transition from the battle scene to his memories feels a bit abrupt. It's not a huge issue, but it's a slight disruption in the flow. The rest of the narrative connects well, especially the plan and the drummer's role. However, that one jarring transition might affect coherence slightly.

So for Fluency, the big problem is that one severely flawed sentence. Even though the rest is mostly okay, that error is significant. Fluency score would be around 2.5 because it's frequent enough to cause difficulty but not everywhere.

For Coherence, the main issue is the abrupt memory shift, but overall the story flows. So maybe a 4, since it's mostly coherent with just a minor lapse.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Severely garbled sentence ("The delay next shots down...") with incoherent word order and missing/incorrect punctuation, significantly impairing readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from battle scene to Robert’s memories (e.g., "He saw a still form beside a lonely road...") without clear linking.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **2.5**
