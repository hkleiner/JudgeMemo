Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, it's mostly a biography with a chronological list of events in Will Bradley's career. The structure seems straightforward, listing years and achievements. I notice that the text is dense with names, dates, and specific projects, which might make it a bit dry but not necessarily unfluent. Checking for grammar or spelling errors... I don't see any obvious mistakes. The sentences are mostly simple or compound, clear in structure. However, some sentences are quite long and packed with information, like the part describing the Rounce and Coffin Club award. Those long sentences might cause a slight pause but don't disrupt flow severely. Also, transitions between different time periods are handled with dates, which keeps it organized. So for Fluency, maybe a high score like 4.5 because it's very clear and well-structured, just some minor issues with sentence length.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect and the overall logical flow. The text starts with an afterword praising Bradley, then dives into his biography, awards, and a detailed chronology. The shift from the afterword to the brief bio might feel a bit abrupt. For example, the quote "I have never known any guide other than what to me happened to look right."--w. b. comes right before "AN AFTERWORD" without clear connection. Then it jumps into talking about awards and then his birth and career steps. The structure is mostly chronological after the initial praise, but the transition from the awards to his early life could be smoother. Also, there are a lot of specific details (like magazine names, typefaces) that are listed without much explanation, assuming the reader is familiar. This might make it a bit disjointed for someone not knowing the context, but since it's a biography section, it's somewhat expected. The main issue is the abrupt transition from the introductory praise to the bio details. So Coherence might score around 4 because it's mostly logical but has a couple of jumps.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and dense with information (e.g., award descriptions), slightly disrupting flow.  
- [LEXICON] Specialized typography terms (e.g., "Morris Golden face," "electrotypes") may require domain knowledge.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from introductory praise to biographical details (e.g., quote to "AN AFTERWORD").  
- [STRUCTURE] Chronological jumps (e.g., awards in 1950/1954 precede birth/year details).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
