Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current segment. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

Looking at the text, there are a few places with awkward phrasing. For example, the line "So Philadelphia in the the of on asthe and, just a land reared ’s quaint old its of war troublous, republic they life they traveled the ended Debby and to young birth house outskirts began proud head." This part seems jumbled with repeated words ("the the"), incorrect prepositions ("in the of"), and unclear structure. That's definitely a syntax and grammar issue. 

Another spot is "Hungry, starving Debby rushed to fill her mother’s place!" The repetition of "Hungry, starving" might be for emphasis, but it's a bit redundant. Maybe that's a lexicon issue with word choice. 

Also, in "The outstretched shrinking robed at the empty the black arms and words straightened to figure girl the:" this sentence is hard to parse. There are missing articles ("the empty" should be "empty" or specify what's empty), and the structure is confusing. That's a syntax problem.

For coherence, the text mostly follows a logical sequence, but there are some abrupt transitions. Like when it jumps from Debby's conversation with her mother to traveling to Philadelphia without clear connection. The transition feels sudden. Also, the introduction of Jack Martin feels a bit disconnected; his appearance isn't well-integrated into the narrative flow. That's a structure and transition issue.

The dialogue between Doctor Bell and Deborah seems coherent, but the part where Deborah talks about the chest in the attic is a bit abrupt. It explains her past, but the transition into that memory isn't smooth. Maybe a clarity issue there.

So for fluency, the main issues are syntax errors, grammatical mistakes, and some awkward phrasing. For coherence, the main issues are abrupt transitions and some disconnected elements. 

Scoring fluency: There are multiple syntax and grammar issues, but the text is still mostly readable. Maybe a 3.5 because while there are problems, you can understand it with some effort.

Coherence: The story mostly holds together, but there are noticeable jumps. So maybe a 3 because it's generally coherent but has some distracting issues.
