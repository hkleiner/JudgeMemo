Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the current segment, the text is quite dense and filled with philosophical jargon. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, sentences like "I of universality suppose philosophy in is basal of science the and one Spencer the connexion truths of between his cause for effect." Wait, that sentence seems garbled. Let me check again. Oh, there's a part that says "I of universality suppose philosophy in is basal of science the and one Spencer the connexion truths of between his cause for effect." That looks like a typo or a major grammatical error. The words are jumbled, making it hard to parse. That's a clear [SYNTAX] issue. Also, there are quotes within quotes without clear differentiation, which might confuse the reader. For instance, the quotation from Bergson is nested within the author's text without proper formatting, leading to possible confusion about who is speaking. Additionally, some sentences are extremely long, like the one starting with "For Spencer, as for M. Bergson, we live in a world of change..." which has multiple clauses and could benefit from clearer structure. These contribute to [SYNTAX] and [LEXICON] problems because the vocabulary is highly technical and might not be clear to all readers.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The text jumps between discussing Spencer, Bergson, and their philosophies. There are transitions like "But does Spencer ever suggest..." which seems abrupt. The author critiques Bergson's method and then shifts to comparing their concepts of the Unknowable and Life without smooth transitions. Also, the paragraph starting with "It would take us too far..." introduces a new idea about the intellect portioning the world, which feels like a tangent. Later, the discussion about cause and effect in Spencer's work introduces multiple examples without clear connections, making the flow disjointed. These are [TRANSITION] and [STRUCTURE] issues. The text assumes a lot of prior knowledge about both philosophers, which could make it hard for readers not familiar with their works to follow. However, the overall argument seems to be that both philosophers seek a Source beyond the evolved, even if their approaches differ. Despite some disjointedness, the main points are mostly connected, though with some effort required.

Scoring Fluency: The major syntax error in one sentence is significant. Although the rest is complex but mostly grammatically correct, that one error and the overall complexity might push it to a 3. But considering the rest of the text's fluency despite complexity, maybe 3.5? Wait, the jumbled sentence is a big problem. Maybe 3?

Coherence: The ideas are somewhat connected, but transitions are poor, and there are abrupt shifts. The structure feels a bit disjointed with too many embedded quotes and tangents. So maybe a 3 as well, because while it's generally readable, the flow is interrupted several times.

Wait, let me double-check. For Fluency, the critical error is that one severely malformed sentence. The rest has complex syntax but no other major errors. So maybe 3.5 for Fluency because despite that one mistake, the rest is manageable. For Coherence, the issues are more prevalent—transitions, structure, assumptions. So maybe 3 for Coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Severely malformed sentence ("I of universality suppose...") with jumbled word order.  
- [LEXICON] Overly complex, dense philosophical terminology without clarification.  
- [STRUCTURE] Excessively long, convoluted sentences impairing readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between critiques of Spencer and Bergson (e.g., "But does Spencer ever suggest...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential paragraphs (e.g., discussion of intellect "portioning the world") disrupting flow.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with both philosophers’ nuanced concepts without bridging explanations.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
