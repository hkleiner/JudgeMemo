Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition mentions syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite long and detailed, describing various customs and physical characteristics of the Shera Yögurs. I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking through the text, I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, the part about the costume: "The costume worn consists of a sheepskin coat, short in itself, and made shorter by being bound round by a scarf..." That's a bit convoluted. Maybe a comma splice or run-on? Also, terms like "home-woven scarf" and "so-called Chinese trousers" might be a bit unclear without context, but since it's an excerpt, maybe that's acceptable. 

There's a sentence: "The strange thing was that he had often rightly caught the sound and preserved it in his memory, in spite of the usual long Chinese phrases..." The phrase "rightly caught the sound" might be slightly awkward; perhaps "accurately" would be better. Also, "which the Chinese give Europeans, ta jen (your excellency or your greatness) before the Yögur verbs..." The structure here is a bit tangled. 

Another point: "The men are never bald, but you often see them very grey..." The transition between "never bald" and "very grey" is abrupt. Maybe a comma or rephrasing for flow. 

For Coherence, the text jumps between different topics: marriage customs, childbirth, physical appearance, intelligence, clothing, and habits. Each paragraph seems to introduce a new aspect without clear transitions. For example, after discussing marriage and children, it shifts to physical traits without a connecting sentence. Then to their intelligence and language skills, then to costume, appliances, cleanliness, food, etc. The topics are related to the group's customs but lack smooth transitions between paragraphs. 

Also, some statements feel like isolated facts. For instance, "The Yögurs can multiply figures mentally..." comes out of nowhere after talking about language skills. The text assumes the reader will connect these points, but there's no explicit linkage. 

In terms of Fluency scoring, despite some complex sentences and minor awkwardness, the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues. 

For Coherence, the lack of transitions and abrupt topic shifts would deduct points. It's generally coherent within each paragraph but lacks overall connectivity. So maybe a 3.5, as it's coherent but with noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The costume worn consists...")  
- [LEXICON] Occasionally awkward phrasing (e.g., "rightly caught the sound")  
- [TRANSITION] Minor abruptness between sentences (e.g., "never bald" to "very grey")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., marriage → physical traits → clothing)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between paragraphs  
- [CLARITY] Assumed context in specialized descriptions (e.g., "so-called Chinese trousers")  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
