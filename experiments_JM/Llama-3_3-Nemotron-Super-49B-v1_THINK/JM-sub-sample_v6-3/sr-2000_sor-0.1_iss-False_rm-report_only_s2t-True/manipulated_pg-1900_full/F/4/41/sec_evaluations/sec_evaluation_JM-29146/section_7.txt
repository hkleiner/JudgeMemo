Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points allowed.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice several typos and grammatical errors. For example, "dzsh" instead of "dash", "did not know" is written as "dod not know", "vover" should be "cover", "thouxand-tonner" instead of "thousand-tonner", "wd" for "we'd", "wqy" instead of "way", "subjectife" for "subjective", "ununderetand" for "understand". These are clear spelling mistakes. Also, there's inconsistent spacing or punctuation in some places, like missing articles or incorrect word choices (e.g., "the qualities ofcradar" should be "the qualities of radar"). 

While the text is generally readable, these errors are frequent enough to cause minor disruptions. The sentences themselves are mostly structured well, but the typos and minor phrasing issues (like "X stands for nothing for nothing for nothing, XXX") might make some parts a bit awkward. However, the overall flow isn't severely impacted; it's still possible to understand without too much effort. So for Fluency, I'd say a 4 because it's mostly fluent but with noticeable minor issues.

Next, Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story flows logically, transitions between ideas, and avoids ambiguities. The current segment has several scenes: preparing for blastoff, discussing hyper-space, and then switching to the Dog Star crew tracking them. The transitions between these scenes are abrupt. For example, the shift from Margot's thoughts about proto-man to the Dog Star scene feels sudden without a clear connector. Also, there's some repetition in explaining hyper-space concepts, which might make the narrative a bit disjointed. The dialogue sometimes explains technical details that feel a bit forced or repetitive (like the multiple explanations of hyper-space time). However, the overall structure is logical, and each part contributes to the plot. The main issue is the abrupt scene changes and some info dumping in the dialogue. So Coherence would be a 4 as well because it's mostly coherent but has a few weak transitions and repetitive explanations.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "dzsh", "dod", "vover", "thouxand-tonner", "wqy", "ununderetand").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation and phrasing inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, awkward repetitions like "X stands for nothing...").  
- [LEXICON] Forced technical jargon ("qualities ofcradar").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., Margotâ€™s thoughts to Dog Star crew).  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive hyper-space explanations in dialogue.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connectors between ideas (e.g., proto-man speculation to blastoff).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
