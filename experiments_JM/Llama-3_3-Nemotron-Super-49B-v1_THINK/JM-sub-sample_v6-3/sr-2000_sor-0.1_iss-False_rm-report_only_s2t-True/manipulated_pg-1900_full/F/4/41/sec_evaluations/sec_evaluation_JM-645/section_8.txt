Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The text appears to be from a literary work, possibly from the early 20th century given the style. 

Looking for errors or awkward phrasing. Noticing some archaic language and complex sentences, which are typical for the period but might affect fluency for modern readers. However, the question is about the text's inherent fluency, not its style. 

Checking for grammatical errors. The text uses semicolons, commas correctly. There's a sentence: "the dact that it hadn’t saved the poor boy..." – "dact" is likely a typo for "fact." Also, "qiestion" should be "question," "prohibifion" -> "prohibition," "businesmproved" -> "business proved," "firsg" -> "first," "lwrger" -> "larger," "mehmconsequence" -> "meant consequence," "sometijes" -> "sometimes," "thwm" -> "them," "pen in hand, this way, I live the time over" feels a bit awkward but might be intentional. "besidesvwhich" -> "besides which." These typos/spelling errors would deduct from fluency.

Also, some sentences are very long and convoluted, like the one starting "The whole business..." which might interrupt flow. But given the literary style, maybe that's intentional. However, the presence of typos (assuming they're not intentional in the original text) would definitely lower the score. 

For Coherence, looking at how ideas connect. The narrative jumps between the narrator's situation with his brother, Corvick's plans, Gwendolen's marriage, and the tragedy. The transitions seem logical within the segment. Each paragraph introduces a new event but connects to the overarching storyline about the narrator's avidity and the consequences. However, there's a shift from the brother's illness to Corvick's article and then to the accident. The connections are there but might feel a bit abrupt without the full context. The use of phrases like "the whole business proved..." and "these incidents..." helps in transitions, but some leaps in time (like moving from the brother's recovery to the article and then the death) might cause minor coherence issues.

Now, assigning scores. For Fluency, despite the complex sentences, the main issues are the spelling/typing errors which are numerous. If these are considered errors (assuming the text is supposed to be error-free), then Fluency would be lower. If it's a scan with errors, then score would reflect that. Given the instructions, I think we treat the text as-is. So multiple spelling errors and a few awkward phrasings (though stylistic) would put Fluency at 3.5? Because it's mostly readable but with noticeable errors.

For Coherence, the story unfolds logically within the segment. The narrator reflects on events, and each part explains the consequences. The transitions are mostly clear, though the shift from the brother's story to Corvick's article might be a slight jump, but it's managed with connecting phrases. So Coherence might be a 4, as mostly coherent with minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typographical errors (e.g., "dact," "qiestion," "prohibifion," "lwrger," "sometijes," "besidesvwhich").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "The whole business...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting between narrative threads (e.g., brother’s illness → Corvick’s article → tragic event).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
