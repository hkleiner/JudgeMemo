Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence on a Likert scale.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. Scanning through the text, I notice several typos: "wasncome" (should be "was come" or "had come"), "tje" (the), "sucxess" (success), "st" (at), "hs" (he's), "thd" (the), "yhat" (that), "lkved" (lived), "pezcefully" (peacefully), "atmisphere" (atmosphere), "itcnecessary" (it is necessary), "revelationcof" (revelation of), "utturs" (utters), "skomming" (skimming?), "Louos" (Louis). These are clear spelling errors. Also, some awkward phrasing like "the breath out of his career" might be a bit poetic but could be considered awkward. However, the overall structure of sentences is mostly clear despite the typos. The errors are frequent but the text is still readable. So for Fluency, multiple spelling and minor grammatical issues but not severely impacting readability. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are errors, the flow isn't too broken.

Now Coherence. The text seems to follow a narrative about Fragonard's later life, his decline, death, and then discusses his artistic legacy. The structure moves from his personal life to his art's significance. However, there's a shift from biographical details to an analytical part about his art and the century's atmosphere. The transition might feel a bit abrupt, especially when it jumps to talking about Watteau, Boucher, etc., but it's somewhat connected as it's explaining the artistic context. The ideas are mostly logically sequenced, but the jump from his death to the art discussion could be smoother. Also, some sentences are a bit long or complex, like the last paragraph, which might cause slight confusion but doesn't disrupt coherence badly. So Coherence might be a 4, as it's mostly coherent with a few minor transitions or shifts but no major disconnects.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "wasncome", "tje", "sucxess", "st", "hs", "thd", "yhat", "lkved", "pezcefully", "atmisphere", "itcnecessary", "revelationcof", "utturs", "skomming", "Louos").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the breath out of his career").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from biographical narrative to artistic analysis (e.g., shift to discussing Watteau/Boucher without clear bridge).  
- [CLARITY] Complex, overly dense sentences in later paragraphs (e.g., "His is the last word...").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
