Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, allowing half-points. Let me start by reading the current segment carefully.

**Fluency Evaluation:**
Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. Looking at the current segment, I notice a few typos or possible typos. For example, "wiol" instead of "will" in "that church wiol I join..." That's a spelling error. Also, "Judaismvhas" should be "Judaism has"â€”another typo. There's "mwssacres" which might be "massacres". These are minor but present. 

The sentence structure seems mostly complex and well-formed. However, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, like the one starting "Can one read this..." which has multiple clauses. The transitions between ideas might feel a bit abrupt, but since Fluency focuses on individual sentences, maybe that's more a Coherence issue. 

Also, there's a mix of quotes and poetic language, which is handled well. The use of quotes from various sources (Talmud, Coleridge, Blake, etc.) is integrated without disrupting flow, though the density might make it slightly less fluent for some readers. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are the spelling mistakes and possibly some complex sentence structures, but overall it's well-written. Maybe a score of 4 because the errors are minor and don't greatly disrupt reading.

**Coherence Evaluation:**
Coherence looks at how the whole text hangs together logically. The segment starts with Lincoln's quote, then jumps to questioning Judaism's presence, transitions into a discussion of religious reconstruction, references various prophets and scholars, and ends with a tribute to Arthur Davis. 

The connections between these ideas might not be immediately clear. For example, moving from Lincoln's statement to criticizing Judaism's current state feels a bit disconnected. The shift to the Afterword about Dr. Abrahams and Arthur Davis seems abrupt, especially since it's labeled as an Afterword but is part of the current segment. The ideas about Jewish mission and building Jerusalem are passionate but might lack smooth transitions between paragraphs. 

However, the text does have a thematic coherence around Jewish identity and religious duty. The quotes are used to support points, even if the flow between sections isn't perfectly smooth. 

So for Coherence, there are some abrupt transitions and a sense of disjointedness, especially with the Afterword part feeling like a separate section. But the overall theme holds it together somewhat. Maybe a score of 3.5 because while there are issues, the main ideas are connected thematically.

**Finalizing Scores:**
Fluency: 4 (minor errors, mostly fluent)
Coherence: 3.5 (thematic coherence but some disjointed transitions)

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] Typos (e.g., "wiol", "Judaismvhas", "mwssacres")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to Afterword section  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
