Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. The text seems mostly well-structured, but I notice a typo: "amd" instead of "and". That's a spelling error. Also, the phrase "least of all be applier" doesn't sound right. "Applier" should probably be "applicable" or "applied". So there are spelling and possibly lexical issues here. The sentence structure is generally good, but those errors might deduct points. Since there are a couple of noticeable errors but the overall flow is okay, Fluency might score around 4, maybe 4.5 if the errors are considered minor.

Now for Coherence. The text talks about statesmen needing to consider future Russia. It references "Ostrich politics" and mentions Russia's size. The ideas seem connected: warning against ignoring Russia's future importance. There's a clear progression from addressing short-sighted leaders to emphasizing Russia's significance. However, the transition to "Ostrich politics" might feel a bit abrupt without more context, but within this segment, it's explained as a metaphor. The structure is logical, so Coherence is likely high, maybe a 5, but if the metaphor feels forced or there's a slight disconnect, perhaps 4.5. Since the example uses "least of all be applier" which is incorrect, but in Coherence, that's more a Fluency issue. So Coherence issues might be minimal, hence a high score.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "amd" instead of "and"; - [LEXICON] "applier" likely incorrect, should be "applicable" or similar.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Slightly abrupt introduction of "Ostrich politics" without prior context in this segment.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
