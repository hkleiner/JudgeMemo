Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice several spelling errors. For example, "severak" should be "several", "amonv" instead of "among", "disgracefuk" instead of "disgraceful", "muck-rake" (maybe correct, but check context), "resezrch" is "research", "Oedipjs" should be "Oedipus", "Miltkn" is "Milton", "in his Epilogue to the Queen" might have a typo if the actual title is different. There are also punctuation issues, like missing or misplaced commas, and some awkward phrasing. For instance, "the fear lest this my rsalm" has "rsalm" which should be "psalm". These errors, while not making the text unreadable, are frequent enough to cause minor disruptions.

Now, for Coherence. Coherence looks at how well the ideas flow and connect. The text discusses Tennyson's style, his depreciation, comparisons with other authors, and his views on morality, politics, and religion. There are transitions between these topics, but sometimes the connections feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from Tennyson's allegory to modern research on Malory, then to his inspirations from Spenser and Milton, might feel a bit disjointed without clear transitions. Also, the paragraph structure could be better; some paragraphs are quite long and cover multiple ideas without clear segmentation. However, the overall narrative has a logical progression, even if some shifts between topics aren't perfectly smooth.

So, for Fluency, despite the numerous minor errors, the text is mostly readable. The issues are noticeable but don't severely disrupt understanding, so a score of 4 seems right. For Coherence, while there are some abrupt transitions and lengthy paragraphs, the text remains mostly coherent with a clear structure, earning a score of 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "severak", "amonv", "disgracefuk", "resezrch", "Oedipjs", "Miltkn", "rsalm").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the fear lest this my rsalm").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing/inconsistent commas and line breaks in quoted text.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., Tennyson’s allegory → modern criticism → Malory/Spenser).  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly long paragraphs with unsegmented ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of referenced works (e.g., "Malleor’s" context unclear).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
