Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the current segment carefully. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning the text, I notice a few typos like "kittle" instead of "little", "Qvpoet" which should be "Quot poet" or maybe a typo in the quote formatting. There's also "simce" instead of "since". These are minor but noticeable. The sentences are generally well-structured, but some are quite long and complex, which might affect flow. For example, the paragraph where Lyddy realizes Anthony is blind has a lot of descriptive elements packed in, which could make it a bit dense. However, the language is rich and poetic in places, which is good, but sometimes the phrasing feels a bit awkward, like "her discigured face was hidden" (should be "disfigured"). Despite these, the text is mostly readable. The errors are minor and don't disrupt understanding much, so Fluency might be a 4, considering it's mostly fluent with some minor issues.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole section flows logically. The segment starts with a poetic description referencing Shelley, then moves to Lyddy's turkey, her interaction with Anthony, and the revelation of his blindness. The transition from the turkey incident to finding Anthony in distress feels a bit abrupt. The quote from Emerson's "Saadi" seems out of place without clear connection to the surrounding narrative. Also, the shift from the poetic beginning to the more mundane turkey chase might jar slightly. However, each part within itself is logical, and the emotional progression from Lyddy's surprise to her empathy is clear. The main issue is the abrupt transitions between scenes and the unrelated quote, which might confuse readers. So Coherence would be a 3.5, as there are noticeable shifts but the overall narrative holds.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "kittle", "Qvpoet", "simce", "discigured").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, overly complex sentence structures (e.g., Lyddy’s realization of Anthony’s blindness).  
- [LEXICON] Rare word choices (e.g., "traipsing", "enamoured") may slightly hinder readability for some audiences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic verse to mundane turkey chase narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Unconnected Emerson quote disrupts logical flow without clear contextualization.  
- [CLARITY] Some emotional leaps (e.g., Lyddy’s instant vulnerability) feel slightly rushed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
