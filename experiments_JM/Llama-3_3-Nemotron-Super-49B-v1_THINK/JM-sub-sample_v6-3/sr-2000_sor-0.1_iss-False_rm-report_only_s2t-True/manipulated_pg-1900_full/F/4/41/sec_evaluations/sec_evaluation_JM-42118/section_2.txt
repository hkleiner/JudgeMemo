Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition mentions syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. Looking through the text, I notice some typos like "amidsf" (should be "amidst"), "zmall" (small), "fot" (for), "thd" (the), "common-srnse" (common sense), "qnxious" (anxious), "reyurning" (returning), "desources" (resources), "Tbrown" (Thrown), "enlargement ofnthe" (enlargement of the), "kn" (in), "qnd" (and), "iing's" (king's), "cesign" (design), "hia" (his), "Tie" (tie, but maybe a typo for "Then" or correct as is?), "Franve" (France). These are clear spelling errors. Also, some phrases might be a bit awkward, like "living and breathing the beauty of the pleasant land of romance that bred him" – a bit wordy but not necessarily incorrect. Grammar-wise, most sentences seem structured correctly, but the frequent typos distract. So Fluency would be around 3.5 because while the text is mostly readable, the errors are noticeable and somewhat disrupt flow.

Now Coherence. The text follows Fragonard's journey in a logical sequence: from his early life, meeting Boucher, training with Chardin, then Boucher again, winning the Prix de Rome, time in Rome, influences, and friendships. Each part connects to the next, though there are some jumps, like the sudden mention of the king's stabbing and the political context. However, these are contextual and don't disrupt the main narrative about Fragonard. The structure is clear, with a chronological progression. Maybe some transitions could be smoother, but overall it's coherent. Score around 4 because it's mostly coherent with minor weaknesses.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "amidsf", "zmall", "fot", "thd", "common-srnse", "qnxious", "reyurning", "desources", "Tbrown", "enlargement ofnthe", "kn", "qnd", "iing's", "cesign", "hia", "Franve").  
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly verbose phrasing (e.g., "living and breathing the beauty of the pleasant land of romance that bred him").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Brief, disconnected historical tangents (e.g., King Louis’s stabbing) that slightly disrupt narrative focus on Fragonard.  
- [TRANSITION] Mild abruptness between artistic training and broader political context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
