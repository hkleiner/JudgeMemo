Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately. Let me start with Fluency.

Looking at the text, the first thing I notice is the complexity of the sentences. They're quite long and packed with details, which might make them a bit hard to follow, but the structure seems mostly logical. There are some potential grammar issues. For example, in the sentence "They believe that in years gone by they had both lived in Tangutá, which they left simultaneously." The phrase "years gone by" is a bit informal, but maybe acceptable in academic writing. Then there's "at the request of the t'idu in Kanchow, by Chiangch'un...". The use of "by" here might be slightly awkward; perhaps "through" would be better. Also, "six tshi Huang-fan" – "tshi" might be a typo or non-standard unit, but without context, it's hard to say. 

Further down, "Death, and also the amalgamation with the Chinese element, has greatly diminished the tribe..." The subject-verb agreement here is correct ("Death... has"), but the sentence structure is a bit convoluted. There's a missing article in "in a family where there is more than one son" – should be "a family". Also, "the percentage of lamas is as great as among the Mongolians" – "as great as among" sounds a bit off; maybe "similar to" would be smoother.

In the administrative division section, the table format is a bit confusing without proper alignment, but since it's a text extract, maybe that's expected. Terms like "o cha, v chq, o ma cha" are probably transliterations and might be intentional, though they could confuse readers unfamiliar with them.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between different topics: historical context, tribal structure, customs. The transitions could be smoother. For example, moving from the administrative division directly to uses and customs feels abrupt. There's no clear connector between those sections. Also, the list of "bones" with numbers seems like a data dump without explanation of their significance beyond the family system. The part about the widow's inheritance and marriage customs is clear but feels like a list of points rather than a flowing narrative.

For Fluency, despite some awkward phrasing and minor errors, the text is generally readable. The issues are minor but noticeable, so maybe a 4? For Coherence, the abrupt transitions and lack of clear connections between sections, especially after the administrative division, warrant a lower score, perhaps 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "at the request of... by Chiangch'un").  
- [LEXICON] Archaic/informal expressions ("years gone by").  
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "statemeny", "br").  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly dense, unbroken paragraphs.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from administrative divisions to customs.  
- [CLARITY] Unexplained technical terms (e.g., "tshi", "o cha").  
- [STRUCTURE] Data-heavy sections (e.g., "bones" list) disrupt narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
