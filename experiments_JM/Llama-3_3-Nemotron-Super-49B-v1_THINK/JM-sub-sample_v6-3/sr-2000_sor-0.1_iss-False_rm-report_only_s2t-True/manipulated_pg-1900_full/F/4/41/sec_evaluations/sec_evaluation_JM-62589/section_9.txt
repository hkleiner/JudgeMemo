Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text looking for grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexicon issues. 

Looking at the text, there are several typos. For example, "seafched" should be "searched", "likr" instead of "like", "glammingncamp" probably "gleaming camp", "departednto" should be "departed to", "gad" instead of "had", "qeakly" is "weakly", "gis" might be "his", "ih" should be "in", "thecbwilderment" is "the bewilderment", "Ztumbling" is "stumbling", "hij" instead of "he", "naught" is a bit archaic but acceptable in historical context, "bxttle" is "battle". These are clear spelling errors. 

Then, grammar and syntax. Sentences like "He was alone! The others had departed." are simple but effective. Some sentences are long but structured okay. However, "Sick and exhausted as he was he must make a break for safety." lacks a comma after "was", making it a bit awkward. Also, "You may indeed." feels abrupt without more context, but maybe that's intentional for drama.

For Coherence, the story seems to follow a logical sequence: Robert leaving the camp, encountering Morley, their confrontation, the duel, Morley's death, and Robert's resolve. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after the duel, the shift to Robert finding Morley alive might feel sudden. Also, the introduction of Deborah Mason and the messages could be clearer. The structure mostly holds, but some parts feel rushed or lack smooth transitions.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the typos and a few awkward phrases, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much, so maybe a 4. 

For Coherence, the overall narrative flows, but there are some disconnects and abrupt scenes. It's mostly coherent but with some weaknesses, so a 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "seafched", "likr", "gad", "qeakly", "Ztumbling", "hij", "bxttle").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., missing commas, abrupt sentence transitions).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts (e.g., duel aftermath to Morley’s survival without clear transition).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous introductions (e.g., Deborah Mason’s context assumed without explanation).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
