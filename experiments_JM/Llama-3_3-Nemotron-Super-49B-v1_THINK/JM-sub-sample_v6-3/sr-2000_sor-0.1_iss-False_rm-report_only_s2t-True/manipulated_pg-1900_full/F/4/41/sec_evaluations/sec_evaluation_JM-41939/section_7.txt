Okay, let me start by carefully reading the current segment that needs evaluation. The previous section is provided for context, but I shouldn't consider it for scoring. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

First, Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. Let me go through the text line by line.

Looking at the first sentence: "No less perfect is the canvas..." That's a bit formal but grammatically correct. Then, "which it took Rosa Bonheur twenty years to bring to completion." The pronoun "it" refers back to "canvas," which is correct. 

Next paragraph: "But at last we come to the close of her career." "At last" is a transition, seems okay. Then details about her health and talent. The sentence structure here is clear. 

Further down: "The praise was unanimous; they even talked of awarding her the medal of honour which she refused..." "Medal of honour" should probably be "honour" with a 'u' if it's British spelling, but the text uses "honour," which is correct in British English. Wait, but the original context had "relics of the great artist" with no issues, so maybe the spelling is consistent here. 

Then, "a congestion of the lungs prostrated her suddenly and the end came in a few days." "Congestion of the lungs" is an old term for pneumonia, which is understandable. 

Next part about her death and the funeral. "The concert of regrets..." "Concert" here means a unified expression, which is correct. "Without a dissenting note, without reserve, the entire press paid tribute..." That's a bit repetitive ("without a dissenting note" and "without reserve") but not a major issue. 

Spelling errors? Let me check. "whicj" in "cortège whicj followed her coffin" – that's a typo, should be "which." Also, "wkrld" in "Parisian wkrld of art and letters" – missing 'o', should be "world." "artkst" at the end, should be "artist." These are clear spelling mistakes. 

Syntax and grammar: The sentence "Strangers came in throngs, especially from England." is simple and correct. "And this innumerable cortège that followed her bier testified more eloquently..." The structure is a bit complex but grammatically correct. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are the spelling errors ("whicj", "wkrld", "artkst") and possibly some slightly formal or repetitive phrasing, but overall the text is well-structured and fluent. The spelling errors are noticeable but not abundant. So Fluency score might be 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The section starts with "No less perfect..." transitioning from the previous painting to another. Then moves to the end of her career, her last work, death, and funeral. The structure seems logical: discussing a key artwork, then her late career, death, and legacy. 

Transitions: "But at last we come to the close of her career." That's a clear transition. Then after describing her health and the painting, it moves to her death suddenly. The connection between her vigorous health and sudden death is logical. Then the mourning and funeral follow naturally. 

Is there any disjointedness? The shift from art discussion to biography seems smooth. Each paragraph connects to the next. The only potential issue might be the sentence "According to her desire, she was interred..." which comes after talking about the press tribute. But it's a natural sequence: death, mourning, burial. 

So Coherence is high. The narrative flows logically without abrupt shifts. Maybe a minor point if the transition between paragraphs could be smoother, but overall very coherent. Score 5 for Coherence.

Wait, but let me check again. The part about the concert of regrets and the funeral procession – all these elements support the coherence about her death and legacy. No contradictions or confusing parts. So yes, Coherence is 5.

Fluency had those spelling errors, so maybe 4.0. But wait, are there any grammar issues besides spelling? Let me check again. The sentence structure is mostly complex but correct. The use of commas and semicolons seems appropriate. The only errors are the typos. Since the scale allows for minor issues in a 4, and these are minor (though noticeable), Fluency is 4.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "whicj" (should be "which"), "wkrld" (should be "world"), "artkst" (should be "artist")  
- [LEXICON] Formal tone with slightly archaic vocabulary (e.g., "congestion of the lungs")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Mild repetition in "without a dissenting note, without reserve"  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
