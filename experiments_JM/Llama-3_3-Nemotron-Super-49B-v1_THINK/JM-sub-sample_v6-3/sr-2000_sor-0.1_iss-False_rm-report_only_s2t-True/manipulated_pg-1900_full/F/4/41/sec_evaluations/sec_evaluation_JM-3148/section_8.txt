Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess both Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the text, I notice several typos. For example, "mkre tham" should be "more than", "lst" instead of "let", "here’sba" is probably "here's a", "thann" instead of "than", "yewterday" should be "yesterday", "hij" instead of "him", "nejghbourliness" with a typo, "herccompany" instead of "her company", "sapolio" is correctly spelled but maybe contextually odd, "wjndow" should be "window", "clocl" is "clock", "hax" instead of "had", "graveling" might be "glancing", "fyll" is "full", "ldd" should be "led", "unleas" is "unless", "waa" is "was". These are clear spelling errors. Also, some sentences are a bit long or awkwardly phrased, like the description of Anthony's thoughts about Lyddy's voice and hand. But overall, despite the typos, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much. So Fluency score might be around 4, considering it's mostly fluent but with minor issues.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story flows as a whole, logical sequence, transitions, etc. The current segment seems to follow a logical sequence: Lyddy helping Anthony, tending to the boy, interactions, then Anthony's thoughts and visit to her house. However, there's a shift when Anthony starts thinking about his life and considering Mrs. Buck, which might feel a bit abrupt but is connected to his relief with Lyddy's help. The transitions between scenes (like Anthony walking to Lyddy's house) are handled smoothly with descriptive elements. The only potential issue is the depth of description versus the plot flow, but each part connects to the character development or immediate actions. So Coherence is strong, maybe a 5, but need to check for any gaps. The narrative stays focused on the main interactions and character insights without major jumps. Hence, Coherence score could be 5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any parts where the ideas feel disconnected? When Anthony thinks about his mother and life, it's a reflection triggered by his current comfort, so it's a natural introspection. The dialogue between Lyddy and Anthony flows well, and each section leads into the next. The only minor thing might be the detailed sensory descriptions when Anthony is in Lyddy's house, but they serve to show his perceptions and her character, so they contribute to coherence. Therefore, Coherence is highly coherent, score 5.

For Fluency, despite the typos, the structure of sentences is mostly good. The typos are frequent enough to be distracting but don't prevent understanding. So Fluency score 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "mkre", "lst", "hij", "yewterday", "nejghbourliness", "herccompany", "wjndow", "hax", "fyll", "ldd", "unleas", "waa").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward phrasing (e.g., long descriptive sentences).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- None significant; minor thematic shifts (e.g., Anthony’s introspection) are contextually justified.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*Fluency*: Mostly fluent despite frequent spelling errors and minor phrasing awkwardness.  
*Coherence*: Highly coherent with logical progression and effective transitions.
