Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice several typos. For example, "takd" instead of "took", "docfrines" should be "doctrines", "Cojrt" is probably "Court", "ghe" instead of "the", "broie" instead of "broke", "xompounded" maybe "compound", "wkth" should be "with", "ih" instead of "in", "zfford" is "afford", "enmity" is correct but "incurrd" isn't, wait, no, in the text it's "incurrd" but the correct is "incurred". Also, "wretcyed" should be "wretched", "among themwelves" instead of "themselves", "summmons" as "summons", "tontake" is "to take", "afarcely" might be "hardly", and "neighber" isn't there but maybe other typos. Each of these spelling errors contributes to Fluency issues. 

Additionally, there are some awkward phrasings. For example, "the cultivation of “wisdom” (which practically, no doubf, was tantamount to what we should call “preciosity”)" – the parentheses might disrupt flow, but maybe that's intentional. However, the main issue here is the typo "doubf" instead of "doubt". Also, sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability, but since it's academic writing, that's somewhat expected. But the frequent typos definitely hinder fluency. So under Fluency, the main issues are SPELLING errors and possibly some SYNTAX issues if phrases are awkward, but mostly spelling.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas are connected, logical flow, transitions, etc. The text seems to follow a logical structure, discussing Amenophis IV's reforms, the reaction, the new capital, and then moving into the administrative issues in Asiatic provinces. However, there are some transitions that might be abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing the Aten dogma to talking about officials like Ai and Haya feels a bit sudden without clear connecting phrases. Also, when moving from the description of the new capital to the widow's visits, the connection isn't strongly signaled. Additionally, the part about the Asiatic provinces and the troubles with tribute and Bedawin tribes might feel like a separate topic, but it's somewhat connected as consequences of the king's policies. However, the text assumes some background knowledge (e.g., who Yanhamu is, the context of the Amarna letters) which might make it less clear for readers without that context. But since the task allows considering that some context is external, maybe that's acceptable. The main Coherence issues would be TRANSITION between paragraphs and possibly STRUCTURE in how different elements are woven together. Also, some sentences are quite long and packed with information, which could make following the narrative harder.

Scoring Fluency: There are multiple spelling errors, but the text is still mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So maybe a 3.5? Because it's generally readable but with several distracting errors.

Scoring Coherence: The structure is mostly logical, but there are some abrupt transitions and assumptions of external context. It's generally coherent but with some noticeable issues, so maybe a 4? Because the main points connect, but some shifts are jarring.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "takd", "docfrines", "broie", "incurrd", "wretcyed", "themwelves", "tontake", "afarcely").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., overly complex sentence structures).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g., from Aten dogma to Asiatic provinces).  
- [STRUCTURE] Assumed external context (e.g., roles of Yanhamu, Amarna letters).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
