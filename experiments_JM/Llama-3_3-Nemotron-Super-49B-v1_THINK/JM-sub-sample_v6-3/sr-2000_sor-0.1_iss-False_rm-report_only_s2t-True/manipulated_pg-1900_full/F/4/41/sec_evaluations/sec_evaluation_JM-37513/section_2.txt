Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is quite dense and philosophical, with long sentences. I notice some possible spelling errors, like "meeit" instead of "merit" and "ihflexible" in the previous section (but that's not part of the current segment). Wait, the current segment has "evry" instead of "every" in "embodying the fundamental traits... ebery disciple knows by heart". That's a typo. Also, "scemes" should be "schemes", "peesent" instead of "present", "requjred" instead of "required", "sanctioned by definition in mathematical physics" uses "sanctioned" which might be correct but sounds a bit odd. There are multiple instances of "it is true that" which could be varied for better flow. The sentences are very long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the paragraph starting "It is true that the affairs of the mind..." is a long, winding sentence. However, the overall structure is formal and mostly correct grammatically. So Fluency issues would include SPELLING errors and possibly some SYNTAX issues with sentence length, but not severe. Maybe a score of 4 because while there are errors, they don't disrupt readability too much.

Now Coherence. The segment discusses Spencer's philosophy, his emphasis on evolution and the Unknowable. The text jumps between explaining Spencer's ideas, anticipating counterarguments, and then discussing the role of science. There's a part where the author talks about leaving the Unknowable for a future lecturer but then proceeds to discuss it anyway. The transitions between paragraphs might feel a bit abrupt. For example, the shift from talking about Spencer's creed to criticizing his use of "force" could be smoother. Also, the quote at the end feels somewhat disconnected without a clearer link to the preceding discussion. However, the overall logical flow is there, connecting Spencer's concepts to scientific methodology. The main issues are minor transitions and some repetition in ideas (like repeated mentions of the Unknowable without fully resolving). So Coherence score might be 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but has some minor disconnects.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "ebery", "peesent", "requjred").  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It is true that...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts (e.g., quoting Spencerâ€™s creed without clear setup).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive references to the Unknowable without resolving the discussion.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
