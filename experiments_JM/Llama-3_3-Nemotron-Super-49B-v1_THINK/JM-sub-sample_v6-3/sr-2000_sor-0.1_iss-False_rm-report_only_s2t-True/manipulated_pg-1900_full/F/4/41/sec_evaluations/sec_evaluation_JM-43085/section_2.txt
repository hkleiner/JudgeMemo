Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexis, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice some spelling errors like "charvoal" (should be charcoal), "hia" (his), "francsva" (francs a), "nevdr" (never), "chksen" (chosen), "tradw" (trade), "aryist" (artist), "ilpustrations" (illustrations), "dntire" (entire), "ee" (de), "ijportant" (important), "mqde" (made), "libraru" (library), "lrather" (leather). These are clear typos. Also, "donhead studies" might be a typo for "don the head" or more likely "commence" studies. 

Syntax-wise, some sentences are a bit long or awkwardly phrased, like "But while waiting to achieve his dream, he had to achieve a living." It's understandable but could be smoother. "Meissonier very shortly quitted this somewhat dull discipline" feels a bit formal but not incorrect. Punctuation seems mostly okay, but there's a missing article here and there, like "in a house on the Rue des Lombards" could be "a house on the Rue des Lombards" but that's minor.

For Fluency, despite the typos and some awkward phrasing, the text is generally readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much. So maybe a 4? But the number of typos might push it to 3.5. Let me check the scale: Score 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues. Score 3 has multiple issues interrupting flow. Since the typos are frequent but the structure is mostly okay, maybe 3.5.

Now Coherence. The text follows Meissonier's early career, his struggles, and first successes. The structure seems logical, moving from his apprenticeship, financial struggles, early rejections, then successes with Curmer and the editions. Transitions between paragraphs seem smooth. However, there's a jump when it quotes a contemporary and then discusses specific artworks without clear connectors. For example, the paragraph starting "And then, in the words of one of his contemporaries" feels a bit abrupt. Also, the transition to the "CHAPTER: FIRST SUCCESS" heading might disrupt flow if considered part of the text, but since it's a heading, maybe not. The text assumes some background knowledge (e.g., the significance of certain artists or publications), which could cause clarity issues for some readers. 

Coherence issues might include some abrupt transitions and assumptions of knowledge. But overall, the narrative is clear and progresses logically. So Coherence might score 4, as mostly coherent with a few weak parts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "charvoal," "hia," "nevdr," "ijportant," "libraru").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward phrasing (e.g., "donhead studies," "had to achieve a living").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift in paragraph quoting contemporaries without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with historical context/artistic references.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
