Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text and note any issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The first thing I notice are some typos: "comlaratively" should be "comparatively", "eeceives" instead of "receives", "ot" maybe "or", "per impossibile" is correctly used but might be less common. There are also missing articles here and there, like "a President-Prophet" should be "a President and a Prophet" or similar. Some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the sentence starting "And examining the question..." is a bit convoluted. However, despite these, the text is generally readable. The errors are minor and don't severely disrupt flow. So Fluency might be a 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text discusses various historical and philosophical points about the Jewish concept of being a Chosen People, comparing it with other nations like America and England. The structure seems logical, moving from Jewish texts to comparisons with other countries. However, there are some abrupt transitions, like jumping from Jehuda Ha-Levi to discussing America's mission without a clear connector. Also, some paragraphs feel a bit disjointed, and the use of quotes (e.g., Tennyson, Shakespeare) might not always be smoothly integrated. The idea of national missions evolving over time is a thread, but the examples might feel a bit scattered. Still, the overall narrative holds, so Coherence is probably a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but generally coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor typos (e.g., "comlaratively", "eeceives", "ot", "per impossibile", "smtw", "nkt", "thvough", "mynsteries", "froth").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "And examining the question why Israel had been thus chosen...").  
- [LEXICON] Rare archaic/vague terms (e.g., "broidering", "puerile", "exuberance").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Jewish texts, national comparisons (e.g., sudden transition to America/England without clear connectors).  
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences or feel loosely tied to the central argument.  
- [CLARITY] Overreliance on assumed knowledge of referenced figures/texts (e.g., "Mr. Balfour", "Mr. Wells", "Mr. Wassilevsky") without context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
