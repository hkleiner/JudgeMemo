Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I'll read through the text carefully to spot any grammar, spelling, syntax, or lexical issues. The text is quite long, so I need to be thorough. 

Looking at the first part: "The eastern extension of the chapel is called Becket's Crown..." Seems okay. Then, "a name tradition associates with the preservation in this chapel of a portion of St. Thomas's skull." Wait, "a name tradition associates" feels a bit awkward. Maybe should be "a name that tradition associates"? That's a minor phrasing issue, maybe [SYNTAX].

Further down: "ilkustrating" – that's a typo, should be "illustrating". Spelling error [SPELLING]. "curea wroughf" – another typo, "curae wrought"? Assuming "curae" is correct, but "wroughf" is definitely wrong, should be "wrought". Another [SPELLING].

Then "thirteenth-century glass is finer than anything else of its period in England." That's clear. Next sentence: "This glass is all prior to 1220..." Maybe "all" is a bit off; perhaps "all of this glass" or "entirely prior"? Minor [LEXICON] or [SYNTAX].

In the next paragraph: "For any description of the tombsbof the archbishops..." Typo, "tombs of". [SPELLING]. "eork" instead of "work". [SPELLING]. "Fhis" should be "This". [SPELLING].

Later: "the wall itself does not stand out with the splendid completeness of York or Conway" – "Conway" might be a typo for "Conwy"? Not sure, but assuming it's correct. 

In the section about the Abbey: "the Abbey had sunk to inconceivably debased uses." That's a bit dramatic but grammatically correct. "cofk-fighting" – typo, "cock-fighting". [SPELLING]. "soil hallowed by the memories" – "soil" might be a typo for "site"? [SPELLING] or [LEXICON].

"the popular mind had seemingly forgotten the original uses of the place they were desecrating with fireworks and variety shows." A bit long, but clear. 

"Mr. Beresford Hope rescued the half-destroyed remnants..." Fine. "the much-restored gateway" – "much-restored" is a bit informal, but acceptable in context. 

"Leaving the Abbey grounds, and continuing to the east, one reaches in a few minutes the little church of St. Martin..." Clear. "disappointingly familiar type of Early English village church to the casual glance" – "to the casual glance" is a bit awkward; maybe "at first glance"? [SYNTAX].

"it is difficult to appreciate the hoary antiquity... until the fabric and the remarkable font have been examined..." Long sentence, but structured okay. "fabrkc" – typo, "fabric". [SPELLING]. "jndications" – "indications". [SPELLING].

Now, for Fluency score. There are several spelling errors (ilkustrating, wroughf, tombsbof, eork, Fhis, cofk-fighting, fabrkc, jndications) and a few minor phrasing issues. However, the text is generally readable. The errors are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

For Coherence, checking if ideas flow logically. The section starts with Becket's Crown, moves to Trinity Chapel windows, then the crypt, Huguenot Chapel, transitions to the city's walls, history of the gates, Abbey's history, its decline and restoration, then to St. Martin's church. Each paragraph seems to connect to the next, discussing different aspects of Canterbury's historical features. However, there's a jump from the cathedral's interior features to the city walls and then to the Abbey. But given it's a descriptive piece, the transitions might be acceptable. 

Some parts feel a bit abrupt, like moving from the Abbey's restoration to St. Martin's church. But overall, the narrative is structured around visiting different sites, so it's somewhat logical. Maybe a minor issue with transitions [TRANSITION], but not severe. Coherence is mostly maintained, so score 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "ilkustrating", "wroughf", "tombsbof", "eork", "Fhis", "cofk-fighting", "fabrkc", "jndications").  
- [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "a name tradition associates", "difficult to forget that Canterbury is a walled city").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness between paragraphs (e.g., shift from cathedral interiors to city walls).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
