Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. Let me read through the current segment carefully. 

Looking at the text, there are some noticeable spelling errors. For example, "sworr" instead of "swore", "kf" in "kf Salisbury" should be "of", "uo" instead of "up" in "lift uo your head", "thag" instead of "that", "kn" in "kn the pavement" should be "on". These are clear typos. Also, "djiturse" is probably a typo for "Fitzurse". These errors affect readability but don't make the text unintelligible. The syntax seems mostly okay, but there's a sentence structure issue like "the fury of the knights broke at once through the bonds which had partially restrained it" – a bit complex but understandable. Word choice is generally good, but some phrases might be awkward, like "impassioned gestures which are now confined to the half-civilized nations of the South and East" – that's a bit of a long, awkward comparison.

For Coherence, the text follows a narrative sequence. The events unfold logically from Becket's defiance to the knights' reaction, the murder, and the aftermath. However, there's a jump from the murder scene to the monks discovering his body and the immediate canonization process. The transition here feels a bit abrupt without a clear connector. Also, the part about the monks' reaction and the relics seems to introduce new information without smooth transition. The structure is mostly clear, but some sections feel disconnected, like moving from the historical event to the popular reaction and then to the King's penance. These aren't major breaks but noticeable.

Scoring Fluency: The text has several spelling errors and a few awkward phrasings, but overall it's readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are errors, they don't completely disrupt flow.

Coherence: The narrative mostly holds, but there are some abrupt transitions and shifts in focus. Not severely disjointed, so maybe a 3? Because it's generally coherent but with some noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "sworr", "kf", "uo", "thag", "kn", "djiturse").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "the fury... broke at once").  
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal phrasing (e.g., "half-civilized nations").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from murder to immediate canonization rituals.  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of relics and popular reaction without clear connectors.  
- [LOGIC] Minor disjointedness in juxtaposing historical events with later consequences (e.g., King’s penance).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
