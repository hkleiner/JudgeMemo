Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Fluency and Coherence metrics separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but there are several typos and minor errors. Words like "intelkectual" (should be "intellectual"), "vAmerica" (should be "America"), "hame" (maybe "name"?), "BigbHorse" (should be "Big Horse"), "qhieter" (quieter), "amdistant" (a distant), "pight" (probably "light"), "wahs" (ways?), "thebheavy" (the heavy), "wjth" (with), "endmin" (end in), "dearly" (dearly loved?), "jers" (jewels?), "bresthed" (breathed), "msmory" (memory), "indulgejce" (indulgence), "hsd" (had) multiple times. These are all spelling mistakes. Also, some punctuation issues, like missing or incorrect commas, but not too bad. The syntax is generally okay, but a few sentences are a bit long or awkwardly phrased, like the part about Kuei Ping holding the jewels and feeling their nearness. Despite the errors, the text is mostly readable. So for Fluency, I'd say a 4 because the mistakes are noticeable but don't disrupt readability too much.

Now for Coherence. The story seems to follow a logical sequence: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the procession, entering the shop, selecting jewels, bargaining. The transitions between scenes are smooth. However, there's a sudden shift when Kuei Ping reminisces about the mission school on graduation day. This feels abrupt without a clear connection to the current scene. It breaks the flow because it's not foreshadowed or transitioned well. The rest of the narrative is coherent, with consistent character interactions and clear purpose (buying dowry jewels). The abrupt memory flash is the main issue, so Coherence would be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but has one notable disruption.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "intelkectual", "BigbHorse", "wjth", "endmin", "hsd").  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward phrasing (e.g., "her touch bresthed life into them").  
- [LEXICON] Rare word choices (e.g., "tearpstried", "luminous pearls" for emphasis).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to Kuei Pingâ€™s memory of the mission school without clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor repetition in describing jewel selection and bargaining dynamics.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  

Your assessment of the text:  
*The text is mostly fluent despite frequent spelling errors and minor syntactic awkwardness. Coherence is strong overall, but disrupted by an unconnected memory flashback.*
