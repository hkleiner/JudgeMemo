Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the overall Fluency and Coherence of the text based on the section-wise report. 

Starting with Fluency. Each section's fluency score is mostly 4.0, except section 03 which is 3.5. The main issues across all sections are multiple spelling typos in every single section. There are also occasional syntax issues like awkward phrasing or complex sentences. For example, section 03 mentions overly complex prayer dialogue, and section 07 has dense sentence structures. Additionally, archaic vocabulary (like "Thou", "hast") in sections 03 and 06 might affect readability. But despite these, the scores per section are generally high. The typos are frequent but maybe considered minor since the fluency scores didn't drop lower. However, the consistency of spelling errors across all sections could add up. Since most sections are 4.0, which is "mostly fluent with minor issues," but the pervasive typos might bump it down a bit. Maybe a 3.5 overall because while each section is manageable, the cumulative effect of so many typos and some syntax issues could make it a bit more distracting than individual sections suggest.

Now Coherence. The scores vary more: sections 04 and 05 have 3.0, others mostly 4.0 or higher. The issues include abrupt transitions between scenes or topics in several sections (like section 01's backstory shift, section 02's paragraph transitions, section 04's shift to Mrs. Butterfield's death). There are also structural issues like tangential details (section 04) and sudden chapter introductions (section 05). Some sections have minor clarity issues or unconnected quotes (section 07). However, sections 06 and 08 have high coherence scores. The main problem is the repeated abrupt transitions and some disjointed segments, but the overall structure mostly holds. Since some sections have significant coherence drops (3.0), but others are good, maybe an average around 3.5? But considering that most sections are 4.0 or above except two at 3.0, and the issues though present don't completely break the narrative. Maybe 3.5 for coherence as well, because while there are notable disruptions, the text remains generally followable.
