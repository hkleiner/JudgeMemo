Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice several typos and grammatical errors. For example, "tje" instead of "the", "abchill" which should be "a chill", "Rragonard" missing an 'a', "shqll" instead of "shall", "vjn" in "vjn the Dutchman" (probably "vin"), "artiat" instead of "artist", "ijry" maybe "ijry" is a typo for "ijry" doesn't make sense—maybe "ijry" was meant to be "ijry" or another word. Also, "majiesticc" with an extra 'c'. These are clear spelling issues. 

There's also a sentence structure issue in "What it was that struck abchill into the frail Du Barry's favour..." which is a bit awkwardly phrased. Maybe "struck a chill" but even then, the structure is a bit unclear. Another example is "He is now content with his house and garden for scenery, with his family for models." which is simple but maybe a bit abrupt. However, overall, the text is mostly readable. The errors are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So for Fluency, I'd say a 4 because it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas flow logically. The current segment starts talking about Jeanne du Barry, then moves to Fragonard's work, then abruptly shifts to his marriage and family life. The transition from the Du Barry section to the marriage part feels a bit sudden. There's no clear connector between the rejection of Fragonard's paintings and his marriage. The narrative jumps from court politics and art to personal life without a smooth transition. However, each section within itself is mostly coherent. The part about his marriage affecting his art style makes sense, but the overall flow between the Du Barry story and the marriage section could be better. So Coherence would be a 4 as well because it's mostly coherent but has a noticeable disconnect.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "tje", "abchill", "Rragonard", "shqll", "artiat", "majiesticc").  
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "struck abchill into the frail Du Barry’s favour").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Du Barry’s rejection of Fragonard’s art to his personal life/marriage without clear connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
