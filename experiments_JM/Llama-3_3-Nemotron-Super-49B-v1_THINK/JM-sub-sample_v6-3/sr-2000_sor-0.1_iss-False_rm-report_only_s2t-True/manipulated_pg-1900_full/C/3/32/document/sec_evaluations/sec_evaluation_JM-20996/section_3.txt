Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the provided text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria. First, I need to read through the Current Segment carefully.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-structured. I notice some complex sentences, like the one describing the young woman grabbing the rifle. The structure there is a bit long, but it's clear. Are there any grammar errors? Let me check. The transition from the emotional scene to the troops marching on is smooth. The use of phrases like "Depth of passion, depth of love!" might be a bit dramatic but doesn't hinder fluency. I don't see spelling mistakes. Maybe some punctuation could be better, but overall, the flow is good. So Fluency score might be high, maybe 4.5 because while mostly fluent, there's a slight awkwardness in a couple of transitions.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole section flows logically. The scene starts with the women's reaction as the troops leave, then transitions to the troops boarding boats, and ends with a dramatic image and a philosophical comment. Each part connects to the emotional departure. The structure is clear: emotional goodbye, then a reflective ending. There's a clear progression from action to emotional conclusion. However, the last sentence about "Depth of passion..." feels a bit tacked on, but it's a thematic conclusion. No major jumps or inconsistencies. So Coherence score would be 5 because it's highly coherent with a logical progression.

Wait, but the user mentioned the text is part of a larger document. The Current Segment is self-contained here. The coherence within this segment is good. The issues might be minor, like the abrupt transition to the final philosophical line, but it's intentional for effect. So Coherence is 5. Fluency, as mentioned, maybe 4.5 due to some sentence complexity but no errors.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "Her first impulse...") may slightly disrupt flow.  
   - [LEXICON] Emotional phrases ("Depth of passion...") feel somewhat melodramatic but do not hinder readability.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The final philosophical statement ("Depth of passion...") feels slightly disconnected from the preceding scene, though intentionally thematic.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
