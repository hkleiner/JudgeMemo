Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and detailed, which is typical for academic or ethnographic writing. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through, the sentences are mostly long but structured. There are some archaic terms and proper nouns (like "t'idu", "Chiangch'un", "Yögurs"), but they seem correctly used with context. I notice a few potential issues: "in a stuff" might be a typo, perhaps "stuff" should be "stuffing" or another term. Also, "the thing" appears multiple times, which might be a translation issue or placeholder, causing some confusion. Phrasing like "the percentage of lamas is as great as among the Mongolians" is a bit awkward but understandable. The list of "bones" with numbers could be clearer, maybe missing a header or formatting, but since it's a text segment, maybe that's intentional. Overall, the text is mostly fluent with minor, non-distracting errors. So Fluency score might be 4 or 4.5.

For Coherence, the text jumps between historical context, tribal structure, customs, and marriage practices. Each section seems to follow logically within itself, but there might be abrupt transitions between topics. For example, moving from administrative divisions to funeral customs without a clear connector. However, given it's an excerpt from a larger document, some transitions might rely on preceding context. The ideas within each paragraph are mostly coherent, though the overall structure could have better linking. The use of "However" and "As to" helps transition, but some parts feel like a list of facts without smooth flow. Coherence score might be around 4, considering the topic shifts but overall logical progression within sections.

Wait, let me double-check. The administrative division table is presented as a list with Chinese and Yögur names, which might be confusing without a clear explanation of the structure. That could affect coherence. Also, the shift from history to customs might need clearer transitions. But since it's a segment, maybe the original context helps. Still, within this segment, the coherence is generally maintained but with some disjointedness. Maybe a 3.5 for Coherence? Or 4 if the topic shifts are acceptable in the genre.

Fluency issues: The main problems are the unclear "in a stuff" and repeated "the thing" which might be translation errors. Also, some awkward phrasing but not severely impacting readability. So Fluency score 4.

Coherence issues: Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from administrative divisions to funeral rites), and the administrative table might be confusing without explanation. But each section internally makes sense. So Coherence score 4, as the issues are minor and don't disrupt overall understanding much.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "in a stuff" (likely typo or unclear phrase)  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "the thing" without clear definition  
- [PHRASING] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "the percentage... as among the Mongolians")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from administrative details to funeral customs without transitional phrases  
- [CLARITY] Administrative division table lacks explanatory context for non-specialists  
- [TRANSITION] Topic jumps (e.g., history → social customs) with minimal linking  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
