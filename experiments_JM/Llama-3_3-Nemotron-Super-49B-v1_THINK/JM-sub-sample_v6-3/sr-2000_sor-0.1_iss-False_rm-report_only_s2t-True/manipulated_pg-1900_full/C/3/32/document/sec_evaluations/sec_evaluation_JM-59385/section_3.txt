Okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here. The user wants me to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using specific criteria. The output has to be in a very particular format without any explanations. 

First, I'll tackle Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking at the current segment, the writing seems mostly polished. The sentences are complex but structured well. I notice a few possible issues. For example, "wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in a thing" seems out of place and incomplete. That's a syntax issue because "a thing" doesn't make sense here; maybe a typo or missing word. Also, in "Moonlight on which the white magnolia flowers floated as birds about to take wing," the phrase "about to take wing" might be a bit awkward, though it's poetic. Maybe a comma is missing for clarity. Another point: "Square across the entrance gateway" could be "Situated square across" for better phrasing. These are minor, but enough to deduct from a perfect score. So Fluency might be a 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about how the story flows logically. The section starts with Kuei Ping's wedding and then shifts to her sneaking out at night. The transition from the wedding festivities to her nighttime escape feels a bit abrupt. There's no clear connection explained between the end of the wedding and her decision to leave. Also, the part about Fuh Tang returning six days after marriage seems tacked on without context. The sentence structure is mostly logical, but there are jumps. For example, after describing the feasting, it jumps to the third day without much transition. The narrative mostly holds together, but these abrupt shifts and lack of transitions might lower the coherence score. I'd say Coherence is a 3.5 because while the main events are clear, the transitions are weak and some parts feel disconnected.

Wait, let me double-check. The transition from the wedding to her sneaking out: the text says "Thus Kuei Ping became an integral part of the family... Wherein there is a departure..." That "Wherein" line is confusing and disrupts the flow. Then the moonlight scene starts abruptly. That's a big coherence issue. Also, the mention of Fuh Tang returning after six days feels like an info dump. So maybe Coherence is a 3? But the rest of the narrative within each section (wedding, nighttime escape) is coherent. Hmm. The main problem is the abrupt transition between the wedding conclusion and the departure scene, and the unclear "wherein" part. So maybe 3.5 is right because the internal coherence of each part is okay, but the overall flow between sections is poor.

Fluency issues: The weird "a thing" line, some awkward phrasings like "about to take wing" without a comma, and "Square across" instead of "Situated square across." These are minor but noticeable.

Coherence issues: Abrupt transition after "Thus Kuei Ping became...", the unclear "wherein" sentence, and the sudden mention of Fuh Tang's return without context. Also, the jump from the wedding to her sneaking out at night without a clear link.

So final scores: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent, minor issues), Coherence 3.5 (some disjointedness but generally follows).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Incomplete/incoherent sentence fragment ("...live in a thing").  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing ("about to take wing" without clarifying punctuation).  
- [SYNTAX] Unclear preposition usage ("Square across the entrance gateway").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition after "Thus Kuei Ping became..." with unresolved context shift.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear relevance of "wherein" paragraph to preceding narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of Fuh Tangâ€™s return without contextual bridge.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
