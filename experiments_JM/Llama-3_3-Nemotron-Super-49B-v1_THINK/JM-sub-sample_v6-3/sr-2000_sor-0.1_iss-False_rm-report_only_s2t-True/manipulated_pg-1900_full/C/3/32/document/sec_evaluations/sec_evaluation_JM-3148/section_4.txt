Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc., and how smoothly the text reads. The segment is quite lengthy, so I need to scan through for any errors or awkward phrasing.

Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-structured. There's some complex vocabulary like "cabined, cribbed, confined" which might be a bit archaic but not incorrect. I notice a few places with long, winding sentences, like the part where Aunt Hitty plans the funeral details. For example, the sentence starting "She glanced round the house..." has multiple clauses stacked without commas, which might make it a bit hard to follow. Also, phrases like "walked quite half a mile beyond the thing’s" – "thing's" here is probably a typo or incorrect usage; maybe "thing's" should be "farm's" or another noun. That's a possible spelling/grammar issue. 

Another point: the use of quotes and dialogue seems correctly formatted. However, there's a lot of descriptive language which, while poetic, might slow the flow. For instance, "O waiting heart of God!..." is a poetic aside that breaks the narrative flow slightly. But overall, the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor, like the "thing's" typo, and some long sentences, but they don't disrupt readability much. So Fluency score might be 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. This looks at how the whole section hangs together logically. The segment starts with a philosophical quote, then moves to Mrs. Butterfield's death, Aunt Hitty's actions, and her planning the funeral. The transition from the quote to the story seems a bit abrupt. The quote from Emerson's "Harp" doesn't directly connect to the following narrative about the death and funeral plans. That's an abrupt shift without clear transition, which affects coherence. 

Within the narrative, Aunt Hitty's character and her obsession with funerals are well-developed, and her thoughts flow logically as she plans the funeral. However, there are some tangents, like the detailed planning of ministers and coffin-plates, which, while character-revealing, might feel a bit disjointed. The reference to "the thing" (probably a typo for "farm" or similar) is confusing without context. Also, the shift from describing Aunt Hitty's past frustrations to her current actions is clear, but the overall structure has some jumps, like the sudden inspiration for two ministers. 

The section ends with planning the choir singing, which connects back to the funeral theme, but the lack of clear transitions between some paragraphs (e.g., from the death discovery to Aunt Hitty's plans) might cause slight confusion. So Coherence issues include abrupt transitions (especially the initial quote), some unclear references ("the thing"), and a few disjointed ideas in planning. But the main narrative thread is mostly clear. So Coherence score might be 3.5, as there are noticeable issues but the overall structure is generally coherent.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., planning details) hinder smooth flow.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] "thing's" (likely typo for "farm's" or similar).
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary ("cabined, cribbed, confined") may slow readability.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical quote to narrative without clear link.
- [CLARITY] Unclear references ("the thing") and tangential planning details.
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed scene transitions (e.g., funeral planning jumps).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
