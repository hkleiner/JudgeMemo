Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is a historical narrative describing the events after Becket's defiance and his murder, followed by the aftermath and canonization. 

Looking through the text, the sentences are generally long and complex, which might affect fluency. For example, the sentence starting "A stuff being much divided..." seems a bit awkward. Wait, "stuff" here is probably a typo for "stuff" being incorrect. Maybe "staff"? Like the monastery staff? That could be a typo, leading to confusion. That's a LEXICON issue because of the wrong word choice. 

Also, there are some phrases like "the thing" repeatedly used. Wait, in the context, "the thing" might refer to the Archbishop or the monastery? That's unclear. For instance, "the thing had assumed an attitude of defiance" – "thing" here is ambiguous. Should it be "Becket" or another term? This causes clarity issues, so maybe a CLARITY problem under Fluency. 

Another point: "the fury of the knights broke at once through the bonds which had partially restrained it" – the metaphor here might be a bit forced, but not sure if that's a fluency issue. Maybe SYNTAX if the structure is awkward. But overall, the text is mostly readable. There are no glaring grammatical errors, but some word choices and repetitions ("the thing") might disrupt flow. So Fluency score might be around 4, since it's mostly fluent but has minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connectivity of ideas. The segment starts with Becket's defiance, then the murder, the immediate canonization, the relics, the King's penance. Each part transitions to the next, but there's a jump from the murder scene to the monks finding the hair-cloth shirt. The transition here could be smoother. Also, the part about Roger purloining the relic feels a bit abrupt, introduced without much connection to the previous paragraph. Maybe a TRANSITION issue. 

The narrative moves from the event to its consequences (canonization, King's penance) logically, but some sections like the detailed description of the hair-cloth and vermin might feel like a detour, though it's relevant to show the monks' reaction. However, the overall structure is clear, with each event leading to the next. So Coherence might score a 4 as well, with some minor transitions but mostly coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent/inaccurate terminology ("stuff" likely typo for "staff"; repetitive "the thing" without clear antecedent).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "the fury... broke through the bonds").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from murder scene to monks discovering hair-cloth shirt.  
- [STRUCTURE] Tangential detail about vermin in shirt, slightly disrupting narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
