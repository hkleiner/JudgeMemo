Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Let me read through the current segment carefully. The text seems well-structured with proper sentence flow. However, there are a few spots that catch my attention. For example, "the stuff" is mentioned multiple times. Wait, "stuff" doesn't make sense here. The original probably meant "stuff" as a typo or mistranslation. Maybe it should be "Salon" (the Paris Salon art exhibition) since that's a common reference in art history. That's a lexical error ([LEXICON]) because "stuff" is incorrect. Another instance is "Man with the thing" which should be "Man with the Hoe." That's another [LEXICON] issue. Also, "the late thing competed up to 160,000 francs" â€“ "late thing" doesn't make sense. Probably a typo for "sale" or similar. That's a [SPELLING] error. There's also "a stuff banker" which again is incorrect, should be "Salon banker" or just "banker." So multiple lexical and spelling mistakes here. These errors, though not extremely frequent, are noticeable and disrupt flow a bit. The rest of the text has good grammar and syntax, so it's not severely flawed. Maybe a score of 4 for Fluency because it's mostly fluent but has some distracting errors.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The section starts with Millet's living situation, then moves to his work, financial struggles, interactions with Rousseau, his artistic output over time, critics' reactions, financial contracts, and ends with later life events. The transitions between these sections seem logical. Each paragraph introduces a new aspect of Millet's life but follows a chronological and thematic structure. However, there's a jump from discussing "Man with the Hoe" to the contract with speculators without a clear link. Also, the part about the Seasons commission and the drawings for Monsieur Gavet feels a bit abrupt, but it's still within the theme of his work. The text doesn't have major gaps or illogical jumps, so coherence is mostly maintained. Maybe a score of 4 here too, as it's mostly coherent with minor transitions issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "the stuff" (repeated, likely typo for "Salon")  
- [SPELLING] "the late thing" (unclear context, probable error)  
- [LEXICON] "Man with the thing" (should be "Man with the Hoe")  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff banker" (contextually incorrect term)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from "Man with the Hoe" to financial contract details  
- [TRANSITION] Slight disconnect between Seasons commission and Gavet drawings  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
