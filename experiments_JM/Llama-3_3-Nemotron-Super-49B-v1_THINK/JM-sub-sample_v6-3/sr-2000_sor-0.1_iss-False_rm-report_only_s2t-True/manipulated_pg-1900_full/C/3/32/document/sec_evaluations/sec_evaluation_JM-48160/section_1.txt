Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to rate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence using the provided criteria. I have to look for problems in each metric, summarize them, label the issues, and then assign scores.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads—grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text provided is from 1916, so the language might be a bit archaic, but that's not an issue unless it causes confusion. Let me read through the current segment carefully.

Looking at the text, the structure seems mostly coherent. The sentences are long, which was common back then, but they're structured properly. I notice some uses of "the thing" repeatedly, which might be a translation issue or a placeholder. For example, "the thing (the well-being of the wounded)"—maybe "thing" is a substitution for a French term not translated properly. That could affect fluency because it's unclear. Also, there are several instances where the author uses "stuff" in parentheses, like "(the stuff)" multiple times. This seems like a possible error in translation or transcription, making the text slightly awkward. 

Another point: the text has some complex sentences with multiple clauses, but they seem grammatically correct. However, the frequent use of "(the stuff)" or "(the thing)" without clear explanation might interrupt the flow for a modern reader. Are these intentional or errors? Since the original might have had specific terms replaced with "stuff" or "thing" for some reason, it could be a fluency issue due to unclear terminology. 

For Coherence, the text is mostly logical. The author describes trying to get into the war zone, the process, interactions with various people, and finally visiting Meaux. The narrative flows from one event to another. However, there's a part where after getting the carnet rouge, the author goes to Meaux with Mme. Lyon. The transition here feels a bit abrupt. The paragraph before talks about getting permissions and then suddenly they're at Meaux. There's no clear connector between obtaining the carnet and the visit. That's a coherence issue with transitions. 

Also, the text mentions "the battlefield of the Marne" and describes it, but the connection to the previous part about permissions could be smoother. The author's desire to go to the front and the actual visit to Meaux might feel slightly disconnected because Meaux isn't the desired front location. However, the text explains that Meaux was assigned, so it's somewhat connected. Maybe a minor coherence issue here.

Now, scoring. For Fluency: The main issues are the unclear terms ("the thing", "stuff") which might cause minor confusion. The rest is well-structured with no major grammar errors. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has some minor, noticeable issues.

For Coherence: The narrative is generally clear, but there's an abrupt transition to the Meaux visit and perhaps a slight disconnect in the locations visited versus desired. But overall, it's easy to follow. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few minor weaknesses.

Wait, let me check the scales again. Fluency scale: 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues." The "stuff" and "thing" substitutions are minor but repeated, so they are noticeable. Maybe 4 is right. 

Coherence scale: 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The transition to Meaux and the location shift could be considered weak parts, but the overall logic holds. So 4 for both.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Repeated unclear substitutions ("the thing", "stuff") disrupt clarity.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to describing Meaux visit without clear connector.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
