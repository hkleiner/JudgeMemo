Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I'll read through the current segment and note any issues. 

Looking at the text, the sentences are mostly well-structured. However, there are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "a stuff and fourteen thousand men" seems odd; maybe "a force" or similar would be better. Also, "He is nearing Dorchester Heights! Hear me! hear me! We are saved, we are saved! Ha! ha! ha!" has repeated "hear me" which could be streamlined, but it's possibly intentional for emphasis. Grammar-wise, I didn't spot major errors, but some sentences are long and complex, which might affect flow. For instance, "What were his hopes and sorrows now? It was in his power to put strength in sick bodies and joy into hundreds of sad hearts!" is a bit abrupt in transition. 

Now, Coherence. This looks at how the whole section flows logically. The story seems to follow Shirtliffe's actions after leaving the previous scene, his journey, delivering the news, and the reactions. However, there's a shift when the new volunteer, Martin, appears. The conversation between them introduces new information (like searching for someone who looks like Shirtliffe) that feels a bit abrupt. The transition from the camp's celebration to the personal drama could be smoother. Also, the sentence "The situation was too much for the three men. In silence they gazed into each other’s faces and grew sick with apprehension." feels a bit disconnected from the following paragraph about Shirtliffe dashing off. Maybe a better transition is needed there.

For Fluency score: Mostly fluent but some minor issues. Maybe a 4? Because the issues are minor and don't disrupt much.

For Coherence score: Generally coherent but some transitions are weak. The introduction of Martin and the personal subplot feels a bit sudden, but the main narrative flows. Maybe a 4 as well, but need to check the scales again.

Wait, the Coherence scale says Score 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." The issues here are the abrupt introduction of Martin's character and the personal quest, and the transition after the three men's reaction. These are noticeable but don't disrupt the overall flow much. So Coherence might be 4. 

Fluency had some awkward phrasing and a couple of syntax issues, but overall readable. So Fluency 4.0 and Coherence 4.0? Or maybe Coherence 3.5 if the disruptions are more significant. Let me recheck.

In the Coherence section, the main plot points connect (Shirtliffe escaping, delivering news, reaction), but the subplot with Martin adds a layer that's not fully integrated here. It's part of the larger story, but within this segment, it might feel like a slight disconnect. However, since the segment is part of a larger document, some context is assumed. So maybe it's still a 4. 

Alternatively, if the introduction of Martin's character and the dead person feels too sudden without prior context in this segment, that could be a coherence issue. But since the user said to evaluate on its own terms allowing for external context, maybe it's acceptable. So sticking with 4 for both.
