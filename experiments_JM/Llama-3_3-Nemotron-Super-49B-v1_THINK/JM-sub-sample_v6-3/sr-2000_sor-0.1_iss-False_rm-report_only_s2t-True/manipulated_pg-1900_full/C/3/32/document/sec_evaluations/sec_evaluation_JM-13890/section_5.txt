Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to remember the criteria for Fluency and Coherence as given. 

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. The scale goes from 5 (highly fluent) to 1 (unintelligible). 

Looking at the current segment, the text is quite formal and descriptive, which is typical for historical or architectural writing. I notice some long sentences, like the one starting "Throughout the centuries succeeding this crowning glory..." That might affect fluency because it's a bit complex. But overall, the structure seems okay. Are there any grammar errors? Let me check. The sentence "Money was spent so lavishly..." uses "lavishly" correctly. Another part: "the huge doles of food and drink given away..."—"doles" might be less common, but it's correct. Wait, there's a repeated use of "thing" in places, like "a thing's human guise" and "the thing, a great stone gateway". That's probably an error or placeholder. For example, in "the translation of the saint's remains was accomplished amid scenes...", "saint's" should be "Becket's" maybe? Wait, no, because Becket is the martyr. Hmm, maybe "thing" is a typo. Like in "the position of the town in relation to the comings and goings between England and the thing"—"the thing" here doesn't make sense. That's a problem. Also, in the chapter heading: "A thing that look over Canterbury..." should probably be "A sight" or similar. These instances of "thing" are likely typos or unedited placeholders, causing confusion. So for Fluency, the main issues are [SPELLING] with "thing" typos and possibly [LEXICON] for less common words, but the latter might not be errors. The long sentences might contribute to [SYNTAX], but they're manageable. So Fluency score might be around 4, deducting for the typos.

Now Coherence. It's about the logical flow and structure. The text jumps between different time periods: after Henry's penance, the fire, reconstruction, then events in 1220, 1378, etc. Each paragraph seems to follow a timeline, but there are abrupt shifts between architectural details, historical events, and descriptive passages. For example, after discussing the fire and reconstruction, it jumps to the translation of Becket's remains, then to royal visits, then to renovations in different centuries. The transitions between these could be smoother. There's also a shift from historical narrative to a descriptive tour of Canterbury in the last paragraph, which feels a bit disconnected from the preceding historical account. So Coherence issues might be [STRUCTURE] for the timeline jumps and [TRANSITION] between different topics. However, each section within itself is coherent. The score might be 3.5 because while the overall structure has some disconnects, the individual parts are mostly clear.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "thing" likely as typos (e.g., "a thing's human guise," "the thing, a great stone gateway").  
- [LEXICON] Less common vocabulary (e.g., "doles," "opalescent") may slightly impede readability for non-expert readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chronological jumps (e.g., 1220 translation, 1378 rebuilding, 1564 visit) without clear transitional links.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from historical narrative to descriptive tour (e.g., "CHAPTER" section feels disconnected).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
