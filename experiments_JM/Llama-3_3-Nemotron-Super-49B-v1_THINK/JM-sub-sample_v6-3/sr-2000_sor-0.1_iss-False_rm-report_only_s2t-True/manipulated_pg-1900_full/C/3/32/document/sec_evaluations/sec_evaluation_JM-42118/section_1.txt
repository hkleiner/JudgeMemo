Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Section provided, which starts with "CHAPTER: THE BEGINNINGS" and ends before "CHAPTER: ROME". The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite descriptive and uses complex sentences. I notice some archaic language like "a thing" repeatedly, which might be intentional for style but could cause confusion. For example, phrases like "the thing to become king by act" or "the stuff" used multiple times without clear reference. This might affect readability. Also, there are long, winding sentences with multiple clauses, which could make the flow a bit awkward. However, the vocabulary is rich, and the structure mostly holds, even if a bit old-fashioned. So Fluency might be around 4 because while there are some issues, the text is mostly smooth, just with some minor disruptions from archaic terms and sentence length.

Now for Coherence. The narrative jumps between the protagonist's early life and historical events in Paris. There's a clear contrast between Grasse and Paris, but the transitions between these scenes might feel abrupt. For instance, moving from the boy's life to detailed political scandals without clear connectors. The historical context is dense and assumes some prior knowledge (e.g., Madame de Pompadour's role), which could make it hard for some readers to follow. However, the overall structure follows a timeline, and each part relates to the artist's development. So Coherence might score a 3.5 because while the ideas are connected over time, the shifts between personal and historical narrative could be smoother.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaisms ("a thing", "stuff") cause minor confusion.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex, winding sentence structures disrupt flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between biographical and historical contexts.  
- [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of 18th-century French politics.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
