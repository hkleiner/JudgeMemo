Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few things. There's the phrase "our little Scotch cousins" – "Scotch" might be considered less common now, but it's not an error, just possibly outdated terminology. Then, in the sentence "The MacPhersons and the Gordons were all sitting in the library of Kelvin House, to see the old year out and the new year in." The structure here is a bit awkward. "To see the old year out and the new year in" feels a bit forced; maybe "to ring in the new year" is more common. That's a minor phrasing issue. 

Another point: "A table was spread with cakes and many other good things to eat" – "many other good things" is a bit vague, but not a major error. Then, "everybody kept their eyes on the clock" – "their" is singular, but the subject is "everybody," which is singular, so that's correct. No problem there. 

In the part about the "first-footing," the explanation seems clear, but the transition from the description to Uncle Clarke arriving could be smoother. For example, after explaining first-footing, the doorbell rings immediately. It's a bit abrupt but not a huge issue. 

Later, "great kissing and shaking of hands among the happy households" – "households" might be better as "families" for clarity, but again, not a big error. 

In the St. Patrick's Day section, "Our crowd is going to be at the top of the street" – "crowd" here might sound a bit informal, but in dialogue, it's acceptable. The dialogue itself is natural. The phrase "as they ran out by all the back alleyways" – "by all" could be "through all" for better clarity. 

So for Fluency, the main issues are minor phrasing awkwardness and some word choices that are slightly less common or a bit vague. But overall, the text is readable with minimal disruptions. So Fluency score would be 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connections between ideas. The current segment starts with Scottish customs (New Year's), then moves to the "first-footing" tradition, followed by the Royal Proclamation, and then switches to St. Patrick's Day with the Scotch vs. Irish boys fight. Each section is somewhat separate. The transition from New Year's customs to the Royal Proclamation feels okay because it's about Scottish traditions. However, the jump to St. Patrick's Day and the battle between boys feels somewhat disconnected. The narrative shifts from family celebrations to a traditional fight without a clear link. The story about the boys' battle, while interesting, doesn't directly connect to the previous parts about New Year's and the Proclamation. This could cause some coherence issues as the sections don't flow seamlessly into each other. 

Within each part, the logic is sound. The "first-footing" explanation is clear, and the Royal Proclamation scene is well-described. The St. Patrick's Day segment has its own internal coherence. The main problem is the lack of strong transitions between these distinct customs, making the overall coherence a bit weaker. So Coherence score might be 3.5, as there are noticeable shifts but each part is coherent on its own.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "Scotch cousins" (archaic terminology)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "to see the old year out and the new year in"  
- [CLARITY] Vague "many other good things to eat"  
- [SYNTAX] "ran out by all the back alleyways" (clarity in preposition choice)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from New Year’s to St. Patrick’s Day segment  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connection between distinct Scottish customs  
- [LOGIC] Royal Proclamation and boys’ battle feel loosely tied to preceding narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
