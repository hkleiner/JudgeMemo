Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is descriptive, likely from a historical or architectural description of a cathedral. I'll read through and look for grammar, syntax, spelling, or word choice issues. The first thing I notice is the repeated use of "the thing" which seems like a placeholder or error. For example, "the stuff above the roof-line" in the previous context might be a typo, but in the current segment, "a thing's martyrdom" and "the shrine of the stuff" stand out. These are likely errors where the actual term (probably "church" or "cathedral") was omitted. That's a fluency issue under LEXICON because the incorrect terms disrupt understanding.

Next, checking for grammar and syntax. The sentence structure is generally complex but mostly clear. However, there are some long, convoluted sentences. For instance, the part about Archbishop Howley's carriage struggling through the mob is a bit dense but still understandable. Maybe a minor SYNTAX issue here, but not severe. Also, "if space permitted, much could be said" feels a bit formal but not an error. Spelling seems okay, no obvious mistakes. Punctuation looks correct. So the main fluency problem is the missing terms replaced by "thing"/"stuff", which is a LEXICON issue. Since these are multiple instances, it's more than minor. The scale says a 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues. But here, the errors are noticeable and affect clarity, so maybe a 3.5? Because while the text is mostly readable, those placeholders are distracting.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between different parts of the cathedral: the arch, western screen, monuments, chapels, etc. Each paragraph seems to discuss a different feature. The transitions between these sections aren't clearly marked; it feels like a list rather than a flowing narrative. For example, moving from the north-west transept to Trinity Chapel without a clear link. That's a TRANSITION issue. Also, some sentences refer to external context like Chaucer's tales without explanation, assuming reader knowledge. That's a CLARITY problem. However, each individual section is logically structured. The overall coherence is generally there but with some abrupt shifts and assumptions of prior knowledge. The scale for Coherence 4 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. Here, the issues are noticeable but don't disrupt heavily, so maybe a 4?

Wait, but the transitions are weak, and there are several abrupt changes. Maybe a 3.5? Because while the sections are understandable on their own, the flow between them is poor. Also, the comparison to Westminster Abbey comes out of nowhere. So Coherence might be a 3.5.

Finalizing: Fluency has significant LEXICON errors but otherwise okay. Score 3.5. Coherence has TRANSITION and CLARITY issues, score 3.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Repeated use of undefined placeholders ("the thing", "stuff") disrupting clarity.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between architectural features without clear linking. - [CLARITY] Assumes external knowledge (e.g., "Chaucer's the stuff Tales").  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
