Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, there are some noticeable issues. For example, repeated use of "a thing" and "stuff" seems odd. Those might be placeholders or errors. Also, sentences are quite long and complex, which could affect readability. I see phrases like "the stuff of France as considerable shareholder" which is unclear. There's also inconsistent naming, like "Louis of a thing" instead of a proper name. These could be [LEXICON] or [SYNTAX] issues. Some sentences are structured awkwardly, like the part about the Eucharist being hustled around. Maybe [SYNTAX] or [GRAMMAR] there. No obvious spelling errors, but the placeholders definitely disrupt fluency.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at the overall structure and logical flow. The text jumps between different events and characters without clear transitions. For example, moving from Boucher's death to Choiseul's dismissal, then to the king's death, and then to Fragonard's career. These transitions feel abrupt. There's also repetition of ideas, like mentioning Du Barry's character twice. The narrative shifts between historical events and Fragonard's personal life without smooth connections. Some parts, like the description of Terray's financial schemes, might confuse readers without prior context. Issues here could be [TRANSITION], [STRUCTURE], and maybe [LOGIC] for the disjointedness.

Scoring Fluency: The text has multiple lexical issues with the placeholders, some syntactic awkwardness, but overall it's readable. Maybe a 3.5? Because while there are problems, it's not completely unintelligible.

Scoring Coherence: The jumps between topics and lack of clear transitions make it hard to follow. But the overall narrative has a structure, just not well-executed. Maybe a 3? It's generally coherent but with noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of unclear placeholders ("a thing," "stuff") disrupting specificity and clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure (e.g., "the stuff of France as considerable shareholder").  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "Louis of a thing").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical events (e.g., Boucher’s death to Choiseul’s downfall).  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and disjointed narrative flow (e.g., Fragonard’s career interrupting royal politics).  
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and unclear references (e.g., "the stuff had lain supine").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
