Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I'll read through the current segment and note any issues. The text seems mostly well-written, but there might be some awkward phrasing or minor errors. For example, "a thing" in "the ageing shoulders of a thing" might be a typo or unclear term. Also, "stuff" in "a stuff that she had been given patience" could be a mistake ("stuff" doesn't fit; maybe "such" or another word). There's also "the principal of the school" which should be "principal" without "the". These are minor but noticeable. The structure is generally good, so Fluency might be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the story unfolds, logical progression, transitions, etc. The current segment follows Kuei Ping's journey after leaving her family. The narrative moves through her pregnancy, preparations, the birth, and the months after. There's a clear progression, but some transitions might feel a bit abrupt. For instance, the switch from her daily life to the visit from Chang An might lack a smooth transition. Also, the inclusion of Miss Porter's visit and the doctor feels a bit tacked on without clear connection. However, the overall structure is logical, so Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some minor disconnects but mostly coherent.

Wait, let me check again. In Coherence, the scale says a 4 has a few weak parts but doesn't disrupt much. The text has some shifts, like from the family meeting to them leaving, which is handled well. The part where Chang An arrives is introduced without much setup, but it's manageable. The main flow is clear, so maybe Coherence is 4.5? No, because there are a couple of spots where transitions could be better. Maybe 4 is safer.

For Fluency, the errors are minor but present. The "a thing" is confusing, and "stuff" is definitely wrong. So Fluency might be 4, as mostly fluent but with noticeable minor issues.

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "a thing" (likely typo for "a throne" or similar) - [LEXICON] "stuff" (incorrect word usage, should be "such") - [SYNTAX] "the principal of the school" (redundant "the")
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt introduction of Chang An’s arrival - [STRUCTURE] Slightly disconnected mention of Miss Porter’s visit
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
