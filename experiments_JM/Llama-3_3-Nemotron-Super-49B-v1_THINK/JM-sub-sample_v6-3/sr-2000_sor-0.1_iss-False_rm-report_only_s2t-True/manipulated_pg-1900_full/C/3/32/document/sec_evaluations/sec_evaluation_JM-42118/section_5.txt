Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate both Fluency and Coherence on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The current segment is quite long, so I need to scan through it for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the text, there are several instances where "a thing" is used. For example, "the king's ordering, as a thing," "the stuff, to complete the set," "a thing, who never entered into the favourite's friendship." These seem like placeholders or errors instead of actual nouns. That's definitely a fluency issue because it disrupts the flow. The reader has to pause to figure out what "a thing" or "the stuff" refers to. This could be labeled under [LEXICON] since it's about word choice, specifically incorrect or missing terms.

Another point: In the sentence, "Fragonard's old master, Boucher, for some time had been 'going about like a shadow of himself.'" The quotation seems out of context. Without knowing the source or explanation, it might confuse the reader. Maybe [SYNTAX] or [CLARITY], but since it's a quotation without attribution, perhaps [LEXICON] again for unclear references.

Also, there are transitions between paragraphs. For example, moving from discussing Du Barry's rejection of Fragonard's paintings to the chapter on Marriage seems abrupt. But the user mentioned that the text might be part of a larger document, so maybe that's acceptable. However, within the current segment, the shift from Du Barry's story to Fragonard's marriage might feel disconnected. But since it's a new chapter ("MARRIAGE"), maybe that's intentional. Still, within the segment, the flow between paragraphs could be smoother. But I need to check if that's a coherence issue instead.

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The current segment starts with Choiseul's remonstrances, then discusses Du Barry's influence, Fragonard's paintings, and then abruptly moves to Fragonard's marriage and family life. The connection between Du Barry's rejection of Fragonard's work and his subsequent marriage isn't clearly linked. The transition feels abrupt. So that's a coherence issue, maybe [STRUCTURE] because the sections don't flow smoothly into each other. 

Also, in the part about Fragonard's style changing after marriage, there's a lot of detail about his inspirations and specific artworks. While detailed, it might feel like a list rather than a coherent narrative. Maybe [TRANSITION] between the different art pieces discussed.

Another coherence issue: The sentence "It is part of the irony of life that a thing, who never entered into the favourite's friendship, should have become the recognised artist of her day." The reference to "a thing" again is confusing, and the irony isn't fully explained without context. This could be [CLARITY] under coherence.

For Fluency scoring: The repeated "a thing" and "the stuff" are major distractions. However, the rest of the text seems well-structured grammatically. So maybe a 3.5? Because there are noticeable issues but the text is mostly readable.

For Coherence: The abrupt shift from Du Barry to Fragonard's marriage, and the lack of clear connections between some paragraphs. Maybe a 3? Generally coherent but with noticeable issues.

Wait, let me double-check. The Fluency issues are mainly the missing nouns ("a thing", "the stuff"), which are frequent. That's a big problem. So maybe Fluency is 3? Because multiple issues interrupting flow. But the rest of the language is formal and fluent. Hmm. The scale says 3 is "generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues." The "a thing" errors are more lexical than grammatical, but they do interrupt. So perhaps 3.5, considering that apart from those errors, the sentences are well-formed.

Coherence: The structure has some abrupt transitions, especially the shift to the Marriage chapter. But within the Du Barry section, the ideas are connected. The later part about Fragonard's marriage and art style is a new topic but introduced with a chapter title, which might be acceptable in a larger document. However, within the evaluated segment, the transition between the Du Barry story and the marriage could be smoother. So maybe Coherence is 3.5? Because mostly coherent but with some weak connections.

Alternatively, if the transition between Du Barry and Marriage is considered a major structure issue, maybe Coherence is 3.

I think the most serious Fluency issue is the repeated incorrect terms ("a thing", "the stuff"), which are numerous. That's a big fluency problem. So Fluency score: 3. 

Coherence: The main issue is the transition between the two main topics (Du Barry and Fragonard's marriage) without a clear link. Also, some paragraphs feel like lists (e.g., the artworks). So Coherence score: 3.5.

But wait, the Coherence scale says 3 is "generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts." The transition between Du Barry and Marriage is an abrupt shift, but since it's a new chapter, maybe that's intended. However, the user instruction says to evaluate the current segment on its own. The chapter title "MARRIAGE" might signal a new section, but within the segment, the flow from Du Barry's story to the marriage narrative might lack transition. So that's a coherence issue. Hence, Coherence could be 3.5 if the other parts are well-connected, but the main shift is a problem. Alternatively, if the entire segment after the chapter title is coherent on its own, maybe the coherence is better. 

The part after "MARRIAGE" seems coherent within itself, discussing Fragonard's marriage and its impact on his art. The problem is the transition from the previous part. Since the user says to evaluate the current segment on its own but allowing for context, maybe the coherence within the segment is okay except for that one transition. So maybe Coherence is 4? But the transition is within the current segment. The first part (Du Barry) and the second part (Marriage) are in the same current segment. So the transition between them is part of the current segment's coherence. Therefore, that abrupt shift would lower the coherence score. Hence, Coherence: 3.5.

Finalizing:

Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent and unclear use of placeholders ("a thing", "the stuff") throughout the text, disrupting clarity.

Fluency Score: 3 (Multiple lexical issues interrupting flow but overall readable)

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the discussion of Du Barry and the introduction of Fragonard's marriage without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "a thing" in discussing irony) without contextual explanation.

Coherence Score: 3.5 (Generally coherent but with notable structural and clarity issues)

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Inconsistent, unclear placeholders ("a thing", "the stuff") disrupt lexical clarity.
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Du Barry narrative and "MARRIAGE" section. - [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "a thing" in irony explanation).
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
