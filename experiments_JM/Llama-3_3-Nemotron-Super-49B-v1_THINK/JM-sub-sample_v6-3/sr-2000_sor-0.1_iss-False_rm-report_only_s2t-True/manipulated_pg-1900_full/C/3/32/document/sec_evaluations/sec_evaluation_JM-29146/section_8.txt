Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section even though it's given for context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. Scanning through the current segment, I notice that the dialogue seems well-structured. The sentences vary in length, which is good for flow. However, there are some complex sentences, especially in the explanatory parts about hyper-space. For example, the part where Ramsey explains the paradox of hyper-space midpoints might be a bit confusing due to its technicality, but the grammar itself is correct. I didn't spot any outright grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. The word choice is appropriate, and punctuation looks correct. Maybe some of the scientific explanations are a tad awkward, but they don't hinder understanding too much. So Fluency might score a 4 because it's mostly fluent with minor issues in phrasing complexity.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect logically and the overall structure. The segment has a clear dialogue-driven narrative. The conversation between characters progresses logically, discussing hyper-space concepts and leading to the plot point of landing on the world. However, there's a shift when Garr Symm's thoughts are introduced. His internal monologue about fear and ancestral memory feels a bit abrupt compared to the preceding action. The transition from the Enterprise's landing to Garr Symm's scene might lack a smooth connection, causing a slight disjoint. Also, the introduction of the barrier concept and the power it guards could be clearer, but within the segment, it's somewhat explained. The main issue is the abrupt transition between scenes and some unclear connections in the ideas about proto-man's world and the barrier. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while mostly coherent, there are noticeable shifts and some unclear transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., hyper-space explanations) may slightly impede immediate clarity.  
- [LEXICON] Specialized terminology (e.g., "continuum of only three dimensions") assumes prior context.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Enterprise’s action to Garr Symm’s introspection without clear narrative bridge.  
- [CLARITY] Proto-man’s world and the "barrier" concept rely on implied backstory, risking ambiguity for isolated readers.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
