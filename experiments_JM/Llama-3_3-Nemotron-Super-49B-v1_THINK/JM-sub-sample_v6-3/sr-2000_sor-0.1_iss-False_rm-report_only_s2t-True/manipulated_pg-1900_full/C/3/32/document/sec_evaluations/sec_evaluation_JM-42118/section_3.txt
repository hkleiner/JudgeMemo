Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few things. There are repeated uses of "a thing" which seems like a placeholder or error. For example, "the making of history was growing apace. Gossip of it reached to Italy. A backstairs intrigue almost dislodged the thing from power." Here, "thing" should probably be a specific term like "throne" or "position". That's a LEXICON issue because the wrong word is used, causing confusion.

Also, in the sentence "He was created Duc de Choiseul in December 1758. He had as ally one of the most astute and subtle and daring minds in eighteenth-century France--his sister Beatrice, the famous thing." Again, "thing" is incorrectly used; it should be a title or name. This is another LEXICON problem. These errors disrupt the flow because the reader has to pause to figure out what's meant.

There's also a possible SYNTAX issue in sentences like "Fragonard had at last to turn his face homewards; and dawdling through the stuff with Saint-Non..." The phrase "turn his face homewards" is a bit awkward, though not a major error. Maybe a minor GRAMMAR point, but it's somewhat poetic, so maybe not a big deduction.

For Coherence, the text jumps between different topics: Fragonard's return to Paris, political events with Choiseul, then back to Fragonard's art career. The transitions between these sections might feel abrupt. For example, the paragraph about Choiseul's rise to power seems disconnected from the surrounding paragraphs about Fragonard. That's a STRUCTURE issue under Coherence. The narrative shifts without clear transitions, making it a bit hard to follow the overall flow.

Another point: In the part where Fragonard decides to stop painting academic pieces, the text says, "The praises of Diderot and Grimm failed to fill his pockets;" This assumes the reader knows why their praise wouldn't bring financial success. Maybe a CLARITY issue because it's not explained how their praise relates to income. However, given the context of art critics, it might be okay for the assumed audience.

So for Fluency, the main issues are the repeated "thing" errors (LEXICON) and possibly some awkward phrasing. Since these are noticeable but don't make the text unreadable, maybe a score around 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has minor issues.

For Coherence, the abrupt shifts between political and artistic themes without smooth transitions. The STRUCTURE is generally okay, but some parts feel disconnected. So maybe a Coherence score of 3.5, as it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues.

Wait, but the Coherence scale says 3 is "generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts". So 3.5 might be if it's between 3 and 4. Since the transitions are a bit rough but the overall narrative is followable, maybe 3.5.

Finalizing: Fluency has two LEXICON errors with "thing" and some minor syntax, so score 4 (mostly fluent with minor issues). Coherence has STRUCTURE issues with abrupt topic shifts, so 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Repeated use of "a thing" as undefined placeholder (e.g., "dislodged the thing from power", "his sister Beatrice, the famous thing"). - [SYNTAX] Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., "turn his face homewards").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between artistic and political narratives (e.g., Fragonard’s return vs. Choiseul’s rise). - [CLARITY] Unexplained assumptions (e.g., "praises... failed to fill his pockets" without context).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
