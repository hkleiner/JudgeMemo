Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the two metrics: Fluency and Coherence. The text provided is a descriptive piece with some narrative elements. 

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. Scanning through the text, the sentences are generally well-structured. There are long, complex sentences, but they seem to flow okay. I notice some archaic language, like "thou" or "thee" isn't present, but phrases like "the women of the thing" might be a bit awkward. Wait, "the women of the thing"—that's probably a typo or mistranslation. Maybe "the women of the land" or something else? That's a possible grammar or lexical issue. Also, "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet"—"passively quiet" is a bit redundant; maybe "sat quietly" would be better. There's "the day outside is dark" which is a bit formal but not incorrect. Another point: "Kuei Ping liked rich warm color but she liked it best subdued in the luminous pearls." The transition here feels a bit abrupt. Maybe a smoother connection between her preference and the pearls. 

For Coherence, the story seems to follow a logical sequence: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the procession, entering the shop, selecting jewels, bargaining, and then a flashback to the mission school. The flashback might feel a bit abrupt. The transition from the jewel scene to the memory of graduation day isn't clearly signaled. It just says "With a suddenness..." which disrupts the flow. The memory itself is coherent but the shift might confuse readers. Also, some sections are very descriptive, which might slow the pace but doesn't necessarily break coherence.

So for Fluency, the main issues are a couple of awkward phrasings and possible minor grammar errors (like "the women of the thing"), and some redundancy. For Coherence, the main issue is the abrupt transition to the memory without a clear link. 

Scoring Fluency: The text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. Maybe a 4? But there are a few spots, so perhaps 4.5? Wait, the examples I found are minor. The "women of the thing" is confusing—maybe that's a bigger issue. If that's a mistranslation or error, it could deduct more. But assuming it's intentional or a stylistic choice, maybe not. So maybe 4.5 for Fluency.

Coherence: The story mostly flows well, but the flashback disrupts it. Since it's a significant shift without transition, that's a notable issue. So Coherence might be a 4, because the rest is well-connected, but that one part is a problem.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "the women of the thing" (unclear phrasing, possible mistranslation/error)  
- [SYNTAX] Redundant phrasing (e.g., "passively quiet")  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor awkwardness in sentence structure (e.g., "the day outside is dark")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to Kuei Ping’s memory without clear linking device  
- [STRUCTURE] Descriptive sections slow pace but do not disrupt overall logic  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
