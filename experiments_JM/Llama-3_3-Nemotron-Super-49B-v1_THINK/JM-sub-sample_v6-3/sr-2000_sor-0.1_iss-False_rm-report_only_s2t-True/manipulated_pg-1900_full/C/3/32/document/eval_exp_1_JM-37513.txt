Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate both Fluency and Coherence for the entire text based on the section-wise report. Let me start by going through each section's issues for both metrics.

First, Fluency. Looking at the sections, most have Fluency scores around 4.0, except section_07 which is 3.0 and sections 09 and 10 at 3.5. The common issues are overly complex sentences, archaic or formal vocabulary, and some awkward phrasing. For example, section_01 mentions complex sentences and archaic terms like "nay more". Section_03 has dense vocabulary like "suppleness" and convoluted sentences. Section_07 drops to 3.0 with very complex syntax and archaic words. Sections 09 and 10 have issues with sentence structure and jargon. However, sections 03 and 05 have high 4.5 scores, indicating some parts are very fluent despite the challenges. The main problems are consistent across sections: complexity and vocabulary that might impede readability. But since most sections are 4.0 or higher, and the worst is 3.0 in one section, the overall Fluency is likely a 4.0. But wait, the recurring issues are minor in most sections but frequent. The scale says 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues not disrupting readability." Given that even the lower sections (like 3.0) are manageable but noticeable, maybe the average is around 3.8, but since we can't average exactly, considering the majority is 4.0 and the problems are mostly minor, I'll go with 4.0 for Fluency.

Now Coherence. The scores vary more: section_01 is 3.5, section_02 and others 4.0, section_06 and 07 at 3.5, section_08 at 3.0, section_09 at 3.0, and section_11 at 5.0. Issues include abrupt transitions, assumed background knowledge, loose connections between sections, and some structural problems. For example, section_01 has jumps between narrative and exposition. Section_03 has tangential quotes. Section_08 has abrupt shifts and dense concepts. Section_09 has vague explanations. The main recurring issues are transitions and assuming prior knowledge. However, some sections (like 11) are perfectly coherent. The scale for 4.0 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts," and 3.5 is "generally coherent but noticeable issues." Since several sections have 3.5 or 3.0, indicating more impactful problems, but others are 4.0. The average might be around 3.8, but considering the frequency of transition issues and assumed knowledge across many sections, maybe it's a bit lower. However, the highest score is 5.0, but that's just one section. The problems are consistent enough to prevent a high score. Maybe 3.5 overall because while the text is generally understandable, the coherence is often disrupted by transitions and lack of context.
