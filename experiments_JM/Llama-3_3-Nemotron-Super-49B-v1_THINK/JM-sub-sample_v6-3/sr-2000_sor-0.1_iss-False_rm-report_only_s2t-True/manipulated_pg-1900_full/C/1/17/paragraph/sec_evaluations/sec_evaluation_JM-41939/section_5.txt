Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is quite long, so I need to scan through it for any errors or awkward phrasing. The text seems to be a biographical passage about Rosa Bonheur, moving through different events in her life. 

Looking for grammar issues: I notice a few sentence structures that might be a bit long or complex, but overall, the grammar seems correct. For example, "She divided the scheme of instruction into two series, one of the great studies of animals and the other of little studies." That's a bit wordy but grammatically okay. Maybe some commas could help with clarity, but no outright errors. 

Spelling? I don't see any typos. Word choice is formal and appropriate. The only possible issue might be in transitions between paragraphs. For instance, the shift from talking about the art school in 1849 to her later life in By might feel a bit abrupt without a clearer connector, but within each paragraph, the flow is good. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 4.5. Since there are no major errors but some minor phrasing issues, I'll lean towards 4.5.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how well the ideas connect and the overall structure. The segment jumps between different time periods: from Choiseul and historical context, then to the Empress's gift, Reynolds in England, back to Rosa Bonheur's art school in 1849, her retirement, and her later work. These sections seem somewhat disconnected. The historical part at the beginning (Choiseul, Empress, Reynolds) doesn't directly relate to Rosa Bonheur's biography, which is the main focus. The transition from the Empress's scene to Reynolds' biography feels like a non-sequitur. Then it jumps back to Rosa Bonheur's school, which is more relevant. Later parts about her moving to By and her work routine flow better within themselves but the initial sections disrupt the coherence. 

So the main coherence issues are abrupt transitions between unrelated historical figures and the main subject, Rosa Bonheur. The historical context at the start doesn't integrate well with the rest. However, within the Rosa Bonheur sections, the coherence is better. Since there are noticeable disconnects but the rest holds together, Coherence score might be around 3.5. It's not severely incoherent, but the beginning parts are jarring.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Occasionally formal or slightly archaic vocabulary (e.g., "busily engaged," "purplish and cottony") may slightly impede modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Rarely, long sentence structures (e.g., "She divided the scheme...") require close attention but remain clear.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between historical tangents (Choiseul, Reynolds) and Rosa Bonheur’s biography disrupt narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between paragraphs (e.g., Empress’s gift → art school flashback → later life).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
