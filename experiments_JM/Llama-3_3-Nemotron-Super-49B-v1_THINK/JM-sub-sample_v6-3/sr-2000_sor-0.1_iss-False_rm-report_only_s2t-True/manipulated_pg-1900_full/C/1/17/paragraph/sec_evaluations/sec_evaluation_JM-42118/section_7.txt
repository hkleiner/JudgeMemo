Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The current segment is a historical narrative mixed with some philosophical paragraphs about unity. 

Looking through the text, there are some complex sentences, but they seem mostly structured correctly. However, there are a few places where the phrasing feels a bit awkward. For example, "the thunderclap of this 14th of July 1789" might be a bit dramatic but not incorrect. The transition between the historical events and the philosophical part about unity might be a bit jarring, but that's more a coherence issue.

Checking for grammar or spelling errors: I notice "scandals difficult to prove or disprove" – that's a bit wordy but correct. "Ugly scandals got abroad" uses "got" informally, which might be a minor issue in formal writing. Also, "the vile accent of Grasse" – "vile" is strong, but acceptable in descriptive text. 

In the unity section, sentences are long and dense, like "Few will disagree that the universal disease sapping the health of the body of humankind is that of disunity." That's a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. Maybe some comma splices or run-ons, but not sure. The main fluency issue here might be the sudden shift in tone from historical narrative to philosophical discussion without a clear transition, but again, that's coherence.

Now, Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas are connected, logical flow, transitions. The text jumps between Fragonard's personal life, historical events of the French Revolution, and a philosophical tangent about unity. The transition from Fragonard at the Louvre to the discussion on unity seems abrupt. There's no clear link explained between the historical context and the unity theme. The text then jumps back to Fragonard and the Revolution without resolving the unity part. This disrupts the flow.

Also, within the historical part, the events are listed chronologically, which is coherent, but the inclusion of the unity paragraph breaks the narrative flow. The reader might find it confusing why that philosophical section is inserted there without connection to Fragonard or the Revolution context.

So for Fluency, the main issues are some awkward phrasings and possibly informal language in a few spots, but overall readable. Maybe a score of 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

For Coherence, the big problem is the abrupt insertion of the unity paragraph, disrupting the narrative. The historical events themselves are coherent, but the tangent hurts the overall coherence. So maybe a score of 3, since there are noticeable issues affecting the reading experience.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "the thunderclap of this 14th of July 1789").  
- [LEXICON] Informal tone in formal context (e.g., "got abroad").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected philosophical tangent on "unity" disrupting narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] No clear link between historical events and Fragonard’s personal story in some segments.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
