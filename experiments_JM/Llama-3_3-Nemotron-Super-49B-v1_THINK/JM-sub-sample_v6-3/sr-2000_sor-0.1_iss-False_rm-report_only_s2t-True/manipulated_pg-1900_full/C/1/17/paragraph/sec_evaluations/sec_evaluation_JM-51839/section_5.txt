Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems well-structured with proper grammar and spelling. I notice a few places where sentence structure might be a bit complex or wordy, like the part about the Comanches' description. Also, the transition from talking about Nacogdoches' growth to suddenly introducing the "Lords of the South Plains" (Comanches) feels abrupt. That's more a coherence issue, though. For fluency, maybe some sentences are long and could be split, but overall, it's readable. No major grammar errors spotted. Maybe a slight issue with phrasing in "the great stores gave place to little shops"—"gave place" is a bit formal but correct. So Fluency score might be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor, non-distracting issues.

Now Coherence. The segment starts talking about schools, then moves to the war's impact, the railroad bringing recovery, and then shifts to describing the Comanches out of nowhere. That part about Comanches doesn't connect to the rest of the narrative about Nacogdoches' development. It disrupts the flow. Also, the list of flags at the end feels tacked on without a clear connection to the preceding paragraphs. There's a lack of transitions between these sections. However, within each part, the ideas are logical. So Coherence would be a 3 because there are noticeable abrupt shifts but the overall structure isn't completely broken.

Wait, the Comanches section seems entirely unrelated. That's a big coherence problem. But the rest of the text flows okay. So maybe Coherence is a 3.5? Because while there are major disconnects, the majority of the text is coherent. Hmm. The flags part is a conclusion, but it's sudden. The Comanches part is a random insert. That might push it down to 3. 

Fluency: Mostly smooth, minor issues. Score 4.

Coherence: Significant jumps, especially the Comanches paragraph. Score 3.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., Comanches’ description).  
- [LEXICON] Formal phrasing (e.g., "gave place to little shops").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift to Comanches’ description without contextual link.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unconnected list of flags at the end.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
