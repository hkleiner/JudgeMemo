Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence on a scale from 1 to 5 with half-points. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at the text, the sentences seem well-structured. The grammar checks outâ€”no obvious errors in verb tense, subject-verb agreement, or punctuation that I can spot. The vocabulary is formal but appropriate, like "luminous light" and "counting board." However, there are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "to make which men carried pure white marble all the way from India" could be rephrased for better clarity, maybe "for which pure white marble was brought from India." That's a minor issue, though. Also, "seekers after truth please their gods by avoiding evil" is a bit formal but not incorrect. So Fluency is mostly good, maybe a 4 because there are some minor phrasing issues but no major errors.

Now, Coherence. The text switches between describing scenes with Chia Kuei Ping and explaining the role of a t'umu and the community's laws. The transition from the temple descriptions to the t'umu's duties feels a bit abrupt. There's no clear connector between those paragraphs. Also, the last sentence about parents coveting the "luminous light" in Chia's eyes connects back to her influence, but it feels tacked on without a smooth transition from the previous discussion about laws and traditions. The ideas are mostly logical, but the shifts between them could be smoother. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the parts make sense individually, the connections between paragraphs are weak.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "to make which men carried pure white marble" (clarity); - [LEXICON] Formal tone may slightly impede smooth reading for some readers.
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from temple descriptions to t'umu roles; - [STRUCTURE] Last sentence feels disconnected from preceding paragraphs.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
