Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately using the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Looking through the current segment, I notice a few things. There are dialogue tags like "Ramsey smiled without humor" which is fine, but sometimes the dialogue feels a bit forced or lacks transitions. For example, when Margot suddenly says "Shut up. Oh, shut up!" and then switches to "I have to think," it feels abrupt. That might be a coherence issue, but in terms of fluency, the sentences themselves are grammatically correct. However, there are some sentence structures that are a bit awkward. Like the part where Garr Symm thinks about the barrier and power—it's a bit dense. Also, the switch from the spaceship scene to the historical paragraph about Lenormant de Tournehem seems out of place and disrupts the flow. Wait, but that historical part—is that part of the current segment? Let me check. The current segment includes that part about the Marquis de Marigny. That's a big problem because it's completely unrelated to the rest of the space story. That's definitely a coherence issue, but for fluency, maybe the transition is bad. But the historical text itself is well-written, just misplaced. So in terms of fluency within that paragraph, it's okay, but the abrupt switch affects coherence.

Now, Coherence. The story has several parts. The initial part with Ramsey and Margot's conflict, then Garr Symm's thoughts, and then that historical paragraph. The historical part is jarring and doesn't connect to the space narrative. That's a major coherence problem. Also, the transition from the ship landing to Margot checking the environment figures feels a bit rushed, but the ideas are connected. The thoughts of Garr Symm about the barrier and power are somewhat connected to the proto-man concept, but the historical insert breaks the flow entirely.

So for Fluency, the main issues might be some awkward dialogue transitions and the dense paragraphs, but overall grammar and syntax are okay. Maybe a score of 3.5? Because while there are some awkwardness, it's mostly readable.

For Coherence, the historical paragraph is a big problem. It's unrelated and disrupts the narrative. Also, some transitions between scenes could be smoother. So coherence score might be around 2.5 because the main storyline has some logic, but that historical part is a significant disruption.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward dialogue transitions (e.g., abrupt shifts in tone/conversation flow).  
- [LEXICON] Occasionally dense or overly complex phrasing (e.g., Garr Symm’s introspection).  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, uncontextualized historical paragraph disrupts narrative flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Illogical insertion of unrelated historical content (Marigny section).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt scene shifts (e.g., from spaceship conflict to historical tangent).  
- [STRUCTURE] Garr Symm’s fear/barrier explanation feels somewhat disconnected from immediate plot.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **2.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
