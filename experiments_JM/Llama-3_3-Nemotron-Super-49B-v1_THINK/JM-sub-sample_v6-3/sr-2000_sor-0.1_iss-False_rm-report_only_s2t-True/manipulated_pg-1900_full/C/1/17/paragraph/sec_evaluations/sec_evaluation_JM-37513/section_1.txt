Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring any context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text here is quite formal and old-fashioned, given the references to 19th-century authors and the writing style. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability but isn't necessarily a fluency issue if structured correctly. I need to check for grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. Scanning through, I notice sentences like "Was it not accepted by all of us--the enlightened and emancipated men of science whose ranks I had joined as a raw recruit?" which uses archaic structures but is grammatically correct. There's a mix of historical references (Jefferson Davis, Lincoln) alongside philosophical discussions, which might cause some disjointedness but again, not a fluency problem per se. The main issue might be the dense, outdated vocabulary and sentence complexity, but since there are no clear errors, Fluency might score high, maybe 4 or 4.5.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect logically. The text jumps between the author's youthful experiences, historical events (the Peace Conference), and philosophical discussions about Spencer. For example, the transition from talking about Tyndall to the Peace Commissioners seems abrupt. The author mentions Spencer's essay and then discusses its impact, but the shifts between personal anecdote, historical event, and philosophical analysis might disrupt coherence. However, each section within itself is logical, but the connections between them are weak. The historical part about Lincoln and Davis doesn't clearly link to the philosophical discussion except perhaps as a contrast between conflict and evolutionary thought. This could be a coherence issue. Also, the text assumes familiarity with Spencer's works and historical context, which might confuse readers without that background. So Coherence might score around 3.5, considering some abrupt shifts but overall logical flow within sections.

Wait, but the evaluation should be based on the segment's own terms. Even if the historical part seems out of place, maybe it's intentional as a contrast. The author connects their personal introduction to Spencer through the father's friend's comment. The Peace Conference part might be a tangent, but perhaps it's meant to show a parallel between political conflict and scientific progress. If the connections are too vague, that's a coherence problem. The lack of clear transitions between these different topics (youthful enthusiasm, historical event, philosophical theory) could justify a lower Coherence score. So maybe 3.5 for Coherence and 4.5 for Fluency, considering the formal but correct language despite complexity.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "enlightened and emancipated men of science," "quasi-biological") may hinder readability for modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] Extremely long, complex sentences (e.g., "Was it not accepted by all of us...") risk overwhelming clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from personal anecdote (Tyndall’s influence) to unrelated historical event (Lincoln-Davis peace talks) without clear thematic connection.  
- [TRANSITION] Ideas (e.g., Spencer’s philosophy, Darwin/James citations) are logically sequenced internally but lack smooth bridges between paragraphs.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
