Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems well-structured with complex sentences. I notice some long, elaborate sentences, like the one about Fragonard's art embodying the century's evening. While they're a bit dense, they're grammatically correct. There might be a few instances where the word choice is slightly archaic or less common, like "prodigal hand" or "well-nigh discredited," but these aren't errors, just formal language. Punctuation looks correct. Maybe some minor awkwardness in phrasing, but overall, the flow is smooth. So Fluency is probably a 4 or 4.5. Let's say 4.5 because the issues are very minor.

Now Coherence. The text discusses Marguerite Gérard's career, then shifts to Fragonard's legacy and the art of the 1700s. The connections between paragraphs seem logical: talking about the end of Fragonard's kin leads into his artistic legacy and the broader context of 18th-century French art. The paragraphs connect ideas about the artists and their role in capturing the era's atmosphere. However, there's a jump from Marguerite Gérard to the detailed analysis of Watteau, Boucher, and Fragonard. The transition could be smoother, but the topics are related. The structure is mostly logical, with each part building on the previous. Maybe some abrupt shifts, but overall coherent. Coherence score might be 4, as the main issue is a slight transition gap but no major disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "prodigal hand," "well-nigh discredited") may slightly impede readability for modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasional overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "His is the last word...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Marguerite Gérard’s biography to broader artistic commentary without explicit linking.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness between paragraphs (e.g., jump from "peacefully ended" to "Painting with prodigal hand").  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
