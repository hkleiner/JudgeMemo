Okay, let me tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 with half-points.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, etc. The current segment is quite long and has various parts: philosophical discussions, a historical letter, and then more philosophical sections. 

Looking at the text, the first part talks about physico-chemical basis and external events. The language here is formal and complex, with long sentences. For example, "In a broad sense we may say that the inner process knows the external event which is a condition of its occurrence." The sentence structure is intricate but grammatically correct. However, the complexity might make it a bit hard to follow, but that's more about clarity than fluency. 

Then there's a sudden shift to "The light of men is Justice. Quench it not..." which seems poetic and out of context. This abrupt change in tone and style could affect fluency because it disrupts the flow. The reader might feel a jarring transition here. 

Next, there's a historical section about Tushratta sending letters. The language here is more formal, with archaic expressions like "May it be well with thee." This part is well-structured, but the mix of modern philosophical discussion and ancient letter format might cause some fluency issues due to the stylistic inconsistency. 

Later sections return to philosophical discussions with complex sentences and jargon like "cognitive relatedness," "physico-chemical processes," and "psycho-physical parallelism." These terms are correctly used but contribute to dense, challenging reading. The sentences are long and packed with concepts, which could hinder smooth reading for some readers. 

For Fluency, the main issues are the abrupt transition to the poetic verse and the stylistic shifts between different sections (philosophy, historical quote, more philosophy). However, grammatically and syntactically, there are no major errors. The complexity is high, but the text is mostly fluent despite that. So maybe a score of 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has some minor disruptions, mainly from the sudden poetic insert and style changes.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole text hangs together logically, transitions, and consistency. The current segment starts with a philosophical point about inner processes and external events, then abruptly inserts a poetic quote about justice, followed by a historical narrative about Tushratta, then jumps back to philosophy discussing cognition, awareness, and psycho-physical parallelism. 

The poetic quote seems completely unrelated to the surrounding content. It talks about justice and divine wisdom without any connection explained in the text. This is a major coherence issue because it's unexplained and disrupts the logical flow. The transition from the philosophical discussion to the historical letter is somewhat related in that both deal with 'knowledge' or interaction, but the poetic part is a jarring interruption. 

After the historical section, the text returns to philosophy, discussing cognition and awareness. These parts are internally coherent but the overall structure of the segment is disjointed due to the unrelated poetic verse. The lack of clear transitions between these vastly different topics (philosophy, poetry, history, back to philosophy) makes the text feel like a collection of unrelated excerpts rather than a unified piece. 

However, within each individual section (the philosophical parts, the letter), the ideas are logically connected. The problem is the overall coherence across the entire segment. So the main coherence issues are the unconnected poetic quote and the lack of transitions between disparate topics. 

Given that, Coherence would likely score a 3. The text has noticeable abrupt shifts and an unclear structure due to the poetic insertion, affecting the reading experience, but each part on its own is somewhat coherent.

So final scores: Fluency 4 (mostly fluent with minor style disruptions), Coherence 3 (disjointed due to unrelated segment but internally coherent parts).

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [STYLE] Abrupt stylistic shift to poetic verse disrupting flow; - [COMPLEXITY] Overly dense, complex sentence structures challenging smooth reading.
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Unexplained poetic insertion disrupts logical flow; - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between disparate topics (philosophy, history, philosophy).
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
