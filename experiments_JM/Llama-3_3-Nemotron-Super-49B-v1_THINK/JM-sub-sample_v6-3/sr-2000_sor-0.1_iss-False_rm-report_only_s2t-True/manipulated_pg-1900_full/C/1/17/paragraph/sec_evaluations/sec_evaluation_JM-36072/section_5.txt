Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense and filled with complex sentences. I notice long, convoluted sentences that might make reading difficult. For example, the part about Tennyson's disillusionment has a lot of listed elements without clear transitions between them. Also, there are shifts in topics, like moving from Tennyson to Victorian novelists without smooth transitions. Grammar-wise, I didn't spot major errors, but the phrasing is often awkward. Words like "vulgarised" might be less common, affecting fluency. So, Fluency issues would include SYNTAX for sentence structure and LEXICON for word choice.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between discussing Tennyson, Victorian literature, the Industrial Revolution, and imperialism. While related, the connections aren't clearly made. For instance, the transition from literature to the Industrial Revolution feels abrupt. There's also some repetition, like mentioning the greatness of the Victorian age in different contexts without clear progression. The structure isn't logical; ideas are presented but not well-linked. So, COHERENCE issues would involve STRUCTURE and TRANSITION problems.

Scoring Fluency: The text is readable but with notable issues. Maybe a 3.5? It's not highly fluent due to awkward phrasing but no major errors.

Coherence: The lack of clear structure and abrupt shifts suggest a 3. The text is generally understandable but has significant coherence problems.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with multiple embedded clauses (e.g., "Tennyson saw that the Victorian social order was breaking up; and with great prescience...").  
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "vulgarised," "cataract of ink").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from Tennysonâ€™s disillusionment to Victorian novels to Industrial Revolution critiques).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit connections between ideas (e.g., transition from literature to imperialism lacks bridging phrases).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
