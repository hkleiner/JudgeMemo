Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and old-fashioned, which might affect readability. I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, the part about the directors of the new movement failing to see the conditions that produced Greek and Roman sculptors. That sentence is a bit convoluted. Also, there are words like "pursued" and "succour" which might be less common, contributing to lower fluency. However, the grammar and spelling seem correct. The structure of sentences is mostly clear, though some are lengthy. Maybe a score of 4 here because while it's mostly fluent, the complexity and archaic vocabulary cause minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between discussing Millet's early life, his family, the artistic context in France, and then his personal development. There's a transition from talking about the artistic movement to Millet's birth and family, which feels a bit abrupt. For example, after explaining the struggle against classical traditions, it suddenly introduces Millet's village and family without a clear connector. The paragraphs about his childhood, the vicar, and his early art attempts are mostly connected, but the shift from the broader art historical context to the biographical details might disrupt coherence slightly. Also, the quote "Instead it made them savages..." seems out of place and unrelated to the rest, causing confusion. That's a significant coherence issue. So, coherence might score around 3.5 because while the main ideas are there, the transitions are weak and there's an abrupt quote.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "succour," "pursued," "savouring") may hinder modern readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., "The art which expresses...") require careful parsing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from art historical context to Milletâ€™s biography without clear bridging.  
- [LOGIC] Unrelated, unattributed quote ("Instead it made them savages...") disrupts narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological jumps (e.g., childhood memories, vicar anecdote, artistic development) lack smooth progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
