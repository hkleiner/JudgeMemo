Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text seems mostly well-written. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through, the sentences are complex but structured. There's a mix of long and short sentences, which helps flow. I notice some long paragraphs, but that's more about structure than fluency. Wait, are there any grammatical errors? Let me read closely. The transition between paragraphs seems okay, but maybe some sentences are a bit convoluted. For example, "The impeccable truthfulness of a Meissonier stubbornly adheres to that modest harmony which the others leave behind them in a soaring flight that sometimes verges on folly." That's a bit dense, but grammatically correct. Maybe a minor issue with phrasing here and there, but nothing that disrupts reading. So Fluency might be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. The text jumps between different topics: Meissonier's biography, his artistic style, defenses against criticisms, descriptions of a temple (wait, that part about Buddhist pictures seems out of place. Let me check the current segment again. Oh, there's a paragraph starting "Round three sides of the second story..." describing a temple setup. That seems unrelated to the rest of the text about Meissonier. Is that a mistake? The user mentioned the current segment might reference other parts, but this part doesn't connect. That's a major coherence issue. Also, the transition from talking about Meissonier's horses to the temple description is abrupt. Then it cuts back to Academicians fearing him as a master, which connects back but the temple part is jarring. So Coherence has a significant problem with an unrelated section. Other parts flow logically, but that one paragraph disrupts the coherence. So Coherence score might be a 3 because of that major shift, even though other parts are coherent.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "The impeccable truthfulness..."). - [LEXICON] Rarely overly formal vocabulary may slightly impede immediate clarity for non-specialists.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated description of a Buddhist temple setup disrupts thematic flow. - [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts (e.g., from Meissonierâ€™s art to temple description without contextual link).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**  

Your assessment of the text: The current segment generally maintains strong fluency, with sophisticated syntax and minimal errors, though occasional complexity may slow reading. Coherence is compromised by a jarring, unconnected passage about Buddhist temple architecture, which disrupts the otherwise logical narrative focus on Meissonier.
