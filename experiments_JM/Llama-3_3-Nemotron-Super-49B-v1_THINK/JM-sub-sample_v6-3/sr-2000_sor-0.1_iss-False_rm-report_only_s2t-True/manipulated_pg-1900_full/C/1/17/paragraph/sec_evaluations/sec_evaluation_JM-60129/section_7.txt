Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite formal and uses specific terminology, like "t'idu," "Huang-fan," and various tribal names. The sentences are mostly structured well, but some are long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the part about the administrative divisions has a table format but written out, which could be confusing without the actual table. There are also some archaic terms like "ol Governor General" (probably a typo for "old") and "six tshi Huang-fan" which might need clarification. However, the main issue here is the use of non-English terms without explanation, which could hinder fluency for some readers. But overall, the grammar and syntax seem correct, just dense.

Now, Coherence. The text jumps between different topics: historical context, administrative divisions, customs, and marriage practices. Each section is somewhat connected to the Yögurs, but the transitions between these topics aren't smooth. For instance, moving from the administrative list directly into death customs feels abrupt. There's also a random mention of "Dinckmuth" translating works, which seems out of place and unrelated to the rest. The structure lacks clear transitions, making it hard to follow the overall narrative flow.

So for Fluency, the main issues are LEXICON due to untranslated terms and SYNTAX with long sentences. For Coherence, TRANSITION issues and STRUCTURE problems from abrupt topic changes and the unrelated Dinckmuth paragraph.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Untranslated specialized terms (e.g., "tshi", "otóck", "Kurkin kit") without context.  
   - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "This movement is supposed to have taken place during Yungch'eng's reign.").  
   - [SPELLING] Minor typo ("ol Governor General" instead of "old").  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from administrative divisions to unrelated literary reference ("Dinckmuth").  
   - [STRUCTURE] Lack of logical flow between historical, demographic, and cultural sections.  
   - [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of "twelve" introductory point (incomplete or misplaced).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
