Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided: "Thinking of his record, and how his beautiful spirit animates those near and dear to him, we may indeed apply to him this same text: 'His taste remaineth in him and his fragrance is not changed.'"

Starting with Fluency. The sentence structure seems a bit complex but grammatically correct. The phrase "this same text" might be a bit abrupt without context, but since the previous section mentioned a text from Jeremiah, it's referencing that. The quotation uses archaic language ("remaineth", "is not changed"), which might affect fluency for modern readers, but it's intentional for the quote. No obvious grammar or spelling errors. Maybe the sentence is a tad long, but it's manageable. So Fluency score might be 4 or 4.5. Let's say 4.5 because the flow is good despite the complex sentence.

Now Coherence. The current segment refers to "his record" and "those near and dear", which connects to the previous context about the self-taught man and his legacy through his daughters. The quote ties back to the earlier Jeremiah reference. However, without the context, someone might wonder who "him" refers to, but since the task says to consider the segment on its own with possible external context, it's assumed the subject is clear from before. The ideas connect logically: his spirit animates others, so the quote about lasting taste and fragrance applies. Coherence is strong here, so maybe a 5. But since it relies on prior context for the subject and the quote's relevance, maybe a 4.5? Wait, the evaluation should be based on the segment alone but allowing for external context. Since the quote was introduced earlier, the connection is there. So Coherence score 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary in quoted text ("remaineth") may slightly impede modern readability.  
   - [SYNTAX] Marginally complex sentence structure, though grammatically correct.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [CONTEXTUAL ASSUMPTION] Assumes prior knowledge of subject ("him") and referenced text, potentially causing minor ambiguity without context.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
