Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The user mentioned that the previous section should be ignored, so I'll concentrate solely on the "Current Section to Evaluate."

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Let me read through the current segment and note any issues.

Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-structured. There are some long sentences, but they seem to flow okay. I notice a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "the massy foliage and the majestic trees that spring into the swinging heavens." "Massy" is an archaic term for "massive," which might be intentional for style, but could cause a slight pause. Also, "swinging heavens" is poetic but might be unclear to some readers. 

Another spot: "the truth of their character-drawing, the close observation of their cattle and animal-life, their cloudy skies, and the finish and force of their craftsmanship." This list is a bit long without commas separating items properly, which could affect readability. 

There's also "He brought to his homeliest pictures a beauty of arrangement..." "Homeliest" usually means least attractive, but here it probably means "most homely" as in domestic. That might confuse some readers. 

Checking for grammar or spelling errors: I don't see any obvious ones. The text uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures, which are mostly handled well. So Fluency issues might be minor, related to word choice and phrasing. 

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas are connected and the overall logical flow. The current segment starts talking about Fragonard's work being rejected, then moves to his marriage, influences on his art, Boucher's death, and then jumps into political events with Du Barry and Choiseul. The transition from Fragonard's personal life to the political scene feels abrupt. The paragraph about Choiseul being driven from power and the king's attitude seems disconnected from the preceding artistic discussions. It disrupts the flow because it shifts topics without a clear link. 

Also, the section about the Du Barry's bills and Fragonard's absence there is a clear point but feels a bit isolated. The narrative jumps between Fragonard's artistic evolution, personal life, and historical/political context without smooth transitions. These shifts might make the text feel a bit disjointed. 

So for Coherence, the main issues are abrupt topic changes and lack of clear transitions between sections. 

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent with some minor phrasing issues. Maybe a 4. 

Coherence: Noticeable disruptions but overall understandable. Maybe a 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaisms ("massy") and poetic phrasing ("swinging heavens") may cause minor readability issues. - [SYNTAX] Long, comma-less lists (e.g., "truth of their character-drawing...") disrupt flow. - [LEXICON] Ambiguous terms ("homeliest pictures" implies unattractiveness, not domesticity).
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Fragonardâ€™s art to political events (Du Barry/Choiseul) without transitional links. - [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of historical context ("royal France on its downward rushing") disrupts narrative cohesion.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
