Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a narrative part of a story. I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. Scanning through the text, I notice some dialect usage like "T'ank God, dat's Bud" and "I kin." These are intentional for character dialogue, so they shouldn't count as errors. However, there's a sudden shift in tone and topic in the middle of the current segment. The narrative is describing Ches's rescue efforts, and then there's a paragraph that starts talking about "the prevailing alienation of humanity from God" which seems completely out of context. That's a major fluency issue because it disrupts the flow. The rest of the text seems to have good syntax and no obvious grammatical errors. The dialogue and actions are mostly smooth. So the main fluency problem is that abrupt philosophical paragraph.

For Coherence, it's about how the ideas connect. The story follows Ches trying to rescue Jim, then there's that religious paragraph which doesn't connect to the rest. After that, the story continues with Bud and the plan to get help. The interruption by the religious text makes the coherence drop because it's unrelated and breaks the narrative flow. The rest of the story has logical progression: Ches finds Jim, they figure out a plan, Bud decides to send Ches for help, etc. The only coherence issue is that one paragraph disrupting the flow.

So for Fluency, the issue is [STRUCTURE] with an abrupt unrelated paragraph. For Coherence, [LOGIC] due to the same unrelated section causing a disconnect.

Scores: Fluency would be a 4 because except for that one part, the rest is fluent. Coherence maybe a 3 because that one part causes a noticeable break, but the rest holds together.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated philosophical paragraph disrupts narrative flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden, contextually irrelevant religious passage breaks logical sequence of rescue narrative.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
