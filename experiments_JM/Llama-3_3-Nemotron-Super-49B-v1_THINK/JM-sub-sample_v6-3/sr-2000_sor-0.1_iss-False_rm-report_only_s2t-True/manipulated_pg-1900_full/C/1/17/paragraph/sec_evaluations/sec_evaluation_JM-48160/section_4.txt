Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text seems mostly well-written. I'll read through and look for any errors or awkward phrasing. For example, there's a sentence: "Turpentine I felt would avail not in this hotel..." That structure is a bit odd. It should probably be "Turpentine, I felt, would not avail..." The word order is awkward, so that's a syntax issue. Another spot: "the greater one in a cup of the hills" – probably should be "a cup-shaped valley" or similar; "cup of the hills" is unclear, so that's a lexicon problem. Also, "unmistakably a hospital and nothing else (in France)" – the parenthesis might disrupt flow slightly, but it's a minor point. No major grammar errors noticed, but some phrasing issues. So Fluency might be a 4, since it's mostly fluent but has minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas flow and connect. The current segment starts with a philosophical statement about Bahá'u'lláh, then shifts to the narrator's experiences in the hotel, trying to get to military headquarters, visiting hospitals, and then a scene at the station. The transition from the philosophical part to the narrative might feel abrupt. The first paragraph talks about collective coming of age and then suddenly the narrator is eating mutton. That's a disconnect. Also, the part about the American Civil War (Gettysburg, Vicksburg) seems out of place in a WWI context in France. That historical detour disrupts the coherence. Later, the narrative flows better with the hospital visits and the station scene, but those initial transitions are problematic. So Coherence would likely be a 3, as there are noticeable shifts and some disconnected elements.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure (e.g., "Turpentine I felt would avail not in this hotel...") - [LEXICON] Unclear phrasing ("cup of the hills")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical opening to narrative - [STRUCTURE] Unrelated historical reference (American Civil War in WWI context)  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
