Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the context. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The current segment is quite long, so I'll need to scan through it for any errors or awkward phrasing.

Looking at the text, the language seems formal and historical. I notice some complex sentences, but they appear well-structured. For example, the sentence about the monks finding Becket's body and their reaction is a bit long but grammatically correct. There's a part where it says "the marks of the stripes administered on the previous day being plainly visible." That's a bit awkward in structure—maybe a comma or rephrasing could help, but it's understandable. 

Checking for grammar or spelling errors: I don't see any obvious typos. The transition between paragraphs seems logical, moving from the murder to the aftermath, the king's penance, the fire, reconstruction, and then some later historical events. The shift to the paragraph starting "Students of religion are cautioned..." seems a bit abrupt. It talks about not discriminating, then introduces a character in simple white clothing. This feels like a completely different scene without clear connection to the preceding historical narrative. That's a coherence issue, not fluency, though.

For Fluency, the main potential issue is some sentence complexity, but overall, the text is well-written with no major errors. Maybe a few places where sentence structure is a tad awkward, but not enough to deduct much. So Fluency score might be a 4 or 4.5.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas flow logically and connect. The segment starts with the knights trying to drag Becket out, then his murder, the immediate canonization signs, the king's penance, the fire, reconstruction, and then jumps to a caution about theological preconceptions followed by a scene with a woman in white. 

The historical parts flow well: murder → reaction → king's penance → fire → rebuilding. That's logical. However, the part starting "Students of religion..." and the subsequent dialogue about "My heart has found its melody!" seems completely out of place. It shifts from historical events to what appears to be a romantic or religious scene without any transition or connection. This is a major coherence issue because it disrupts the narrative flow abruptly. 

Another possible issue is the quote "Therefore let my brother send gold..." which seems like a scriptural or historical quote but is presented without context, making it unclear how it relates to the rest. However, since the task is to evaluate the segment on its own, if that quote is part of the narrative, it might be confusing. But given the historical context, maybe it's a quote from a document related to the monastery's finances, but it's not integrated smoothly.

So the main Coherence issues are the abrupt scene shift and the unconnected quote. These cause significant disruption. The rest of the historical narrative is coherent. So Coherence score might be around 3, considering the major disruption but otherwise logical flow in other parts.

Finalizing: Fluency is high, maybe 4.5 due to minor awkwardness but no errors. Coherence is 3 because of the major abrupt shift and unclear quote insertion.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., "the marks of the stripes administered on the previous day being plainly visible").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unconnected scene shift (romantic dialogue after historical narrative). - [CLARITY] Unclear, isolated quote ("Therefore let my brother send gold...") without contextual integration.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
