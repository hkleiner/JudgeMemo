Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the current segment, the text appears to be well-written with complex sentences but proper structure. However, there are a few points to note. For example, the transition between the discussion on bookmen and the sudden introduction of "The matter transmitter" by Margot feels abrupt. That's more a coherence issue, though. In terms of fluency, the sentences are mostly clear. Wait, there's a part where the text switches from a descriptive, essay-like style to a dialogue ("The matter transmitter..."). The shift here might cause a slight disruption in flow, but since it's a dialogue, it's somewhat expected. Still, the transition could be smoother. Are there any grammatical errors? Let me check. The text uses phrases like "at the bottom a sneaking fondness" which is idiomatic and correct. The sentence structure is varied and mostly flawless. Maybe some long sentences, but they're structured well. So for Fluency, maybe a high score like 4.5, but need to check for any minor issues. Wait, the part where it says "the bookman orders that delightful treasure to be sent to his own address in order that next day he may present it—as a birthday present—to himself." That's a bit of a long sentence, but grammatically correct. No obvious errors, so Fluency is strong.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect. The current segment starts by talking about book collectors, then moves into a story about a bookman buying a book for himself disguised as a birthday gift. Then suddenly, there's a sci-fi element with Margot talking about a "matter transmitter" and proto-man. This seems completely out of context. The previous section was about historical figures and books, and this part introduces futuristic technology without any transition or connection. That's a major coherence issue. The rest of the text before the dialogue is coherent within itself, discussing the bookman's habits and justification for spending on books. But the shift to the dialogue is jarring and unrelated. Also, the line "These sanctified Mirrors ... are one and all the Exponents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the universe..." seems philosophical and unrelated to the preceding or following content. The question "What could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance...?" also comes out of nowhere. So, the Coherence score would be low because of these abrupt, unconnected segments. The main part about the bookman is coherent, but the insertions of the dialogue and the philosophical statement disrupt the flow significantly.

So for Fluency Issues: Maybe some minor transition issues within the bookman's narrative, but overall fluent. The main fluency deduction might be the abrupt dialogue, but since it's a separate element, perhaps it's more a coherence problem. Wait, the fluency is about the language flow, not the content connection. The dialogue itself is fluent, but the transition between topics might affect coherence more. So Fluency might still be high, like 4.5, with no major errors. 

Coherence Issues: The introduction of unrelated sci-fi dialogue and philosophical statements without connection to the rest of the text. These are major disruptions. So Coherence score would be lower, maybe 2 or 2.5, because while the bookman part is coherent, the other parts are disconnected.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Slightly abrupt transition to dialogue ("The matter transmitter...") disrupts smooth flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Unrelated sci-fi dialogue and philosophical excerpt disrupt thematic continuity. - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between bookman narrative, futuristic tech, and existential query without contextual bridges.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
