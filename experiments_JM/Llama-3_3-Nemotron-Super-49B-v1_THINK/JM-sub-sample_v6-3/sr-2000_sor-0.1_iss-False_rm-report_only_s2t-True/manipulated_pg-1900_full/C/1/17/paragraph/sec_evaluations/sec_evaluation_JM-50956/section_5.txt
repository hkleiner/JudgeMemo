Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Scanning through the current segment, I notice that the text is mostly well-structured. The sentences are complex but generally clear. However, there are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "It is natural that in 1915, when they had in France only 50 per cent. of their total forces, the Germans, through the efforts of Russia, were finally deprived of any chance of winning in France." The use of "50 per cent." with a period might be a style choice, but it's not a major error. Also, some sentences are quite long and dense, which could affect readability, but they're still understandable. I didn't spot any glaring grammar or spelling mistakes. So Fluency is probably a 4, since it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect logically. The current segment talks about various military operations and their impacts. It starts with Ludendorff's statement, then discusses Brusilov's offensive, moves to the Italian front, then to Roumania, and concludes with Russia's role. Each part seems to connect to the overall point about Russia's contributions. However, there's a sudden shift with the line "Please don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year, there would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back, will you? I can't go! I won't go!" This appears completely out of context. It breaks the coherence because it's unrelated to the military discussion. Then there's "After 1750, the Utes joined the Apaches to fight the Comanches." which is another abrupt change, talking about Native American tribes. These sections disrupt the flow significantly. The rest of the text recovers by returning to Roumania and Russia's efforts, but those two inserts are major coherence issues. So Coherence would be a 3 because there are noticeable disruptions, but the rest holds together.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences (e.g., "It is natural that in 1915...") may hinder readability.  
- [LEXICON] Minor stylistic awkwardness (e.g., "50 per cent.").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated inserts (e.g., dialogue about engagement, historical Native American conflict) disrupt narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts between topics (e.g., from Brusilovâ€™s offensive to Roumania without clear connectors).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
