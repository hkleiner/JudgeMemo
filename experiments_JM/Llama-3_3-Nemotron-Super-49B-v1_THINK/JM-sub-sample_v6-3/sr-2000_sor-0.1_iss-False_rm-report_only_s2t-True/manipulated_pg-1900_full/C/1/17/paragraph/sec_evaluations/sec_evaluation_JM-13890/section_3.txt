Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, each on a scale of 1 to 5 with half-points allowed. The user provided a previous section and a current segment to evaluate. I must focus only on the current segment.

First, I'll tackle Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. Looking at the current segment, the text seems well-written with complex sentences. However, there are a couple of places where the structure might be a bit awkward. For example, the sentence "This splendid church, representing the finest achievement of Norman master-builders and workmen, rising high above the domestic quarters of the monastery and standing forth conspicuously from every part of the little walled city, then consisting, to a considerable extent, of low wooden houses, had now reached the stage in its development when it was to be the scene of the murder..." is quite long and has multiple clauses. It's understandable but might cause a slight pause. Also, some phrases like "the same year and the same month as his death" could be rephrased for better flow, but they're not major errors. The dialogue sections, especially between Becket and the knights, are well-integrated and clear. There's a sudden shift with the line "Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and your mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these practical jokes any more." which seems out of context and disrupts the narrative. That's a significant fluency issue because it's jarring and unrelated to the surrounding text. 

Next, Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The text generally follows a narrative about Becket's return and the events leading to his murder. However, there are transitions that could be smoother. For instance, the mention of Dean Stanley's account and the advice to read it might feel a bit like a non-sequitur, breaking the flow. Also, the part where the monks withdraw and the doorkeeper keeps the door ajar feels a bit abrupt without clear connection to the preceding or following sentences. The sudden appearance of the unrelated dialogue about Cecil also disrupts coherence, making the reader question its relevance. Additionally, some paragraphs jump between descriptive historical context and the immediate events without clear transitions, which might confuse the reader.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite the long sentences and one awkward phrase, the text is mostly fluent. The main issue is the out-of-place dialogue, which is a significant disruption. However, since the rest of the text is well-written, I'd rate Fluency as 4, considering it's mostly fluent with a notable but isolated issue.

For Coherence, the narrative has some jumps, especially with the dialogue interruption and some transitions between historical references and the main event. These issues make the text somewhat disjointed, but the overall story is still followable. So Coherence might score around 3.5, as there are noticeable problems but not severe enough to make it hard to follow overall.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Extremely long, complex sentence structures (e.g., first paragraph of current segment) may impede smooth reading.  
- [LEXICON] Abrupt, uncontextualized dialogue ("Cecil and I...") disrupts narrative flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts between historical description (e.g., Dean Stanley reference) and immediate events (e.g., Becketâ€™s murder scene).  
- [STRUCTURE] Unresolved contextual gap (e.g., "Cecil" dialogue appears unrelated to surrounding narrative).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
