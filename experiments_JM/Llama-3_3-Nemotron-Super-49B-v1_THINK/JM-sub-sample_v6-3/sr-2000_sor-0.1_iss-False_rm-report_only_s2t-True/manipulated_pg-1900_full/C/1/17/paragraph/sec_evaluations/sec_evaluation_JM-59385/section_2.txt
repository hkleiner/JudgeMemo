Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite descriptive and uses complex sentences. I notice some long, winding sentences that might affect readability. For example, the part about the soothsayers and the elements has a lot of technical terms (metal, wood, water, fire, earth) which are correctly used but might slow down the reader. Also, there are phrases like "the culmination of the alliance had waited but the year to be set" which are a bit awkward in structure. The vocabulary is rich, with words like "auspiciousness", "cyclic animals", which are correct but might make the text less fluent for some readers. However, overall, the grammar and spelling seem correct. The main issues here are sentence structure complexity and some wordy phrasing, but no major errors. So Fluency might score a 4 because while it's mostly fluent, the complexity and some awkwardness deduct points.

Now, Coherence. The narrative jumps between Kuei Ping's memories and the present wedding scene. There's a clear structure, but transitions could be smoother. For instance, moving from the memory of Miss Porter to the engagement and then to the soothsayers' analysis feels a bit abrupt without clear connectors. The themes of duty vs. freedom are consistent, but the shifts in time (childhood, school, wedding day) might confuse without context. However, each section within itself is logical. The main issue is the abrupt transitions between different time frames and ideas, which makes the coherence mostly intact but with noticeable disruptions. So Coherence might be a 4 as well, since it's mostly coherent but has some weak connections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The culmination of the alliance had waited but the year to be set")  
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "auspiciousness," "cyclic animals")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between memories (e.g., graduation day → soothsayers → wedding preparation) without clear connectors  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear timeline requires close attention to follow contextual leaps  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
