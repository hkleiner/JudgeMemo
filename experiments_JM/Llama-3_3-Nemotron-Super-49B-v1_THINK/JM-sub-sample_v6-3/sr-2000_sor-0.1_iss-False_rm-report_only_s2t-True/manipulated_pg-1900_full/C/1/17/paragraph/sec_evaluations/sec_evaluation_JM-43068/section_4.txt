Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text is a historical/biographical passage about Millet. Reading through, the language seems formal and old-fashioned, which might affect fluency for modern readers, but the question is about the technical aspects. 

Looking for errors: The sentences are long and complex, which might make them a bit cumbersome, but that's style. I notice some archaic terms like "betwixt," "whilst," but those are correct in context. Are there any actual grammatical mistakes? Let me check specific parts. For example, "It says much for Mouchel's breadth of mind that he was equally impressed with the drawings." That's correct. Another part: "He prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him, and set him to work..." The structure here is correct. 

Wait, there's a sentence: "The discussion appears to have been very prolonged, and upon the question being put to a vote it was only carried by means of the casting vote of the mayor." That's a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. Maybe some commas could improve clarity, but no errors. 

In the section about Millet's visit to the Louvre, the sentences are descriptive and properly structured. The part about Delaroche's studio: "Delaroche doubtlessly found the peasant painter a little rude both in his person and in his ideas about art." "Doubtlessly" is an adverb; some might prefer "undoubtedly," but it's not incorrect. 

So, Fluency-wise, the text is mostly fluent. The issues might be with sentence complexity and some outdated vocabulary, but no major errors. So Fluency score would be high, maybe 4 or 4.5. Since there are no errors but some phrasing might be slightly awkward due to formality, perhaps 4.5.

Now Coherence. The text follows Millet's journey from studying with Langlois, dealing with family issues, moving to Paris, interacting with various artists, and his struggles. The structure seems logical, each paragraph builds on the previous. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing Langlois, it jumps to Millet going to Paris, then the Louvre visit, then Delaroche's studio. Each part connects to his development, but transitions could be smoother. 

Also, in the Delaroche section, the text mentions Millet leaving due to neglect and financial issues, then later says Delaroche helped him financially. That might seem a bit contradictory, but it's explained that Delaroche had a kindly heart despite initial neglect. So minor inconsistency there, but clarified. 

The final paragraph about joining Marolle and struggling financially connects back to his artistic pursuit. Overall, the narrative is coherent but has some transitions that could be better. So Coherence score might be 4, as mostly coherent with a few weak connections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary ("betwixt," "doubtlessly") may slightly impede readability for modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] Some overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The discussion... was only carried by... the mayor") could benefit from clearer phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Millet’s artistic influences (e.g., from Langlois to Louvre to Delaroche) lack explicit connective tissue.  
- [CLARITY] Subtle contradiction in Delaroche’s characterization (neglectful vs. supportive) requires close reading to resolve.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
