Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I'll read through the current segment and note any issues. 

Looking at the text, the sentences generally seem well-structured. There are some long sentences, like the one describing Robert's thoughts and memories while drumming. For example: "He saw a still form beside a lonely road, he heard the last words of the dying man, 'Go to Plymouth and find Debby Mason, tell her that her father died like a soldier!'" That's a bit long but grammatically correct. Maybe a minor issue with phrasing, but not a major error. 

Checking for grammar or spelling mistakes. I notice "Molly!" being used as the boy's nickname, which is consistent from the previous context. No obvious typos. The dialogue seems properly punctuated. 

One potential issue might be in transitions between scenes. For example, the shift from the camp to Robert running away, then encountering Morley. The transitions are mostly smooth, but there's a part where after the duel, Robert comes to and finds himself wounded. The sentence "When Shirtliffe came to himself he was lying on his side across a fallen log." might feel a bit abrupt, but it's clear. 

Now, Coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas connect and the overall structure. The segment starts with Washington's interaction, then moves to Robert's drumming, the British sentinels, and then transitions into Robert's escape and encounter with Morley. The plot points seem to follow logically: Robert stays behind, then tries to escape, gets lost, meets Morley, they duel, and then Robert tends to the dying Morley. 

However, there's a part where after the duel, Robert hears someone crying for help and finds Morley. The transition here might be a bit quick. The story jumps from Robert trying to escape to finding Morley wounded without much setup. It feels a bit sudden, but given the context of them dueling, it's somewhat expected. 

Another point is the inclusion of the message for Mrs. Deborah Morley. This introduces a new character (Morley's mother) without prior context in this segment. Since the evaluation is based on the current segment alone, this might cause a slight coherence issue because the reader isn't prepared for this detail. But since it's part of the dialogue and necessary for the plot, it might not be a major problem. 

For Fluency, the main issues are some lengthy sentences and possibly minor transitions, but overall fluent. For Coherence, the sudden encounter with Morley after the duel and the introduction of Morley's mother's message could be minor issues, but the overall narrative flows logically.

Scoring Fluency: Mostly fluent with minor issues, so maybe 4. 

Coherence: Mostly coherent with a few weak transitions or introductions, so maybe 4 as well. But need to check the scales again. 

Wait, the part where Robert finds Morley after the duel might be a bit abrupt. If the segment is evaluated on its own, the reader might not expect Morley to appear again so quickly after the duel. That could be a coherence issue under STRUCTURE or TRANSITION. 

Also, the line "No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact that it was still his mission, the mission of a Chosen People." seems out of place. It's a philosophical statement that doesn't connect to the surrounding dialogue about honor and trust. This disrupts the coherence, labeled perhaps as LOGIC or STRUCTURE. 

That's a significant issue. The sudden insertion of that sentence breaks the flow and doesn't relate to the conversation. So Coherence would take a hit for that. 

So revising Coherence score: With that unrelated sentence, it's a notable problem. Maybe a score of 3.5? Because it's a clear disruption, but the rest of the segment holds together. 

Fluency: The misplaced sentence is more a coherence issue, but if there's a grammar error there... Let me check. The sentence "No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact that it was still his mission, the mission of a Chosen People." The phrase "can away with" seems incorrect; perhaps "can dispel" or similar. So that's a LEXICON or GRAMMAR issue. 

Yes, "can away with" is ungrammatical. So Fluency would deduct for that. 

So Fluency Issues: [GRAMMAR] Incorrect phrase "can away with" (should be "dispel" or similar). 

Coherence Issues: [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of unrelated philosophical statement; [TRANSITION] Sudden reappearance of Morley without clear setup. 

Thus, Fluency score might be 3.5 due to that error, and Coherence 3.5 as well because of the structure and transition issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Incorrect phrase "can away with" (should be "dispel" or similar)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated philosophical statement disrupts dialogue flow; - [TRANSITION] Sudden, unforeshadowed reappearance of Morley after duel  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
