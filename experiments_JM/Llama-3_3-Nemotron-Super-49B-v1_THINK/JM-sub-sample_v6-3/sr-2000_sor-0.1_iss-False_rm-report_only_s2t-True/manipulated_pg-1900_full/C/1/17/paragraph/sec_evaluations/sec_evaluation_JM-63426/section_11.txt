Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, lexicon, etc. The text seems formal and well-structured. Scanning through, I notice a few possible issues. For example, the sentence "Like most Typophile projects, this has been in process for many months." The phrase "in process" might be better as "underway" or "in development," but it's not a major error. Another point: "the first paper-use specimen was issued by Strathmore in Mittineague." "Paper-use specimen" is a bit unclear. Maybe "paper sample" would be clearer, but it's a minor point. Also, "A note indicated that 'advertisements are newly prepared for each number without extra cost.'" The quotes are correctly used here. 

Looking at Coherence. The text jumps between different periods of Bradley's career and then discusses the book's compilation. There's a transition from his career milestones to the description of the book's assembly and sources. The part where it mentions "the first-hand account... assembled from separate papers" might feel a bit abrupt after talking about his achievements. However, the text does explain the sources and editing efforts, so it's somewhat connected. The structure is mostly chronological in the career part, then shifts to the book's creation. The connection between the two parts could be smoother, but it's not severely disjointed. 

For Fluency, despite some minor phrasing issues, the text is mostly fluent. Maybe a 4 because there are a few slight awkwardnesses but no major errors. 

For Coherence, the main issue is the transition between Bradley's career and the book's compilation. It's manageable but noticeable. So maybe a 4 as well, since the overall structure is logical but has a slight disconnect.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "Paper-use specimen" is unclear; consider "paper sample" for clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "In process" (e.g., "Like most Typophile projects...") could be rephrased for smoother flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Bradley’s career timeline to the book’s compilation process without explicit linking.  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness between biographical details and archival/source discussions.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
