Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is quite lengthy, so I need to scan through for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-structured and long, which is common in formal writing. I notice some complex sentence structures, but they seem grammatically correct. For example, "It must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of Millet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated if one is not acquainted with the country he painted." That's a bit long but correctly constructed. Are there any grammatical errors? I don't see obvious ones like missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, or punctuation mistakes. The vocabulary is formal and appropriate, like "resplendent," "opalescent," which fit the context. However, there might be some slightly archaic language or word choices that could affect readability, but not necessarily fluency in terms of errors. 

Wait, there's a part where it says, "the conservative element among the employees would not openly venture so far, but rather thought if his satanic majesty and old Sanders ran a race, the former would come in a bad second, if he were not distanced altogether." The structure here is a bit convoluted, but it's more of a coherence issue with unclear comparisons rather than a fluency problem. 

So for Fluency, the main points are that the text is mostly fluent with some complex sentences but no major errors. Maybe minor issues with sentence length affecting readability, but not enough to deduct much. The score might be around 4 or 4.5. 

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the ideas connect and the overall structure. The current segment seems to jump between different topics related to Millet. For example, it starts talking about technique vs. message, then moves to appreciating Millet's work in context, then discusses specific paintings like "La Baigneuse" and "The Sheep Pen," followed by a paragraph about his philosophical approach, and then suddenly there's a paragraph about the Mescalero Apache Reservation which seems completely out of place. Wait, that last part under "CHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" talks about Apache reservations in 1875 and 1913, which is unrelated to Millet. That's a major coherence issue because it disrupts the flow entirely. The rest of the text flows reasonably, discussing Millet's art style, philosophic themes, and specific works. But that abrupt switch to a different historical topic without connection is a big problem. 

Also, within the Millet discussion, there are transitions between paragraphs that might feel a bit abrupt. For example, moving from "The Sower" to discussing his brush as a means to an end. However, these are still thematically connected. The main issue is the unexpected shift to the Apache Reservation, which is incoherent with the rest. 

So Coherence would have a significant deduction because of that unrelated section. The score might be around 3, considering the rest is mostly coherent but that part is jarring. 

Wait, but the user mentioned that the text is a section from a longer document, and we should evaluate it on its own but allow for possible external context. However, the Apache part seems entirely unrelated. Unless "MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" is a chapter title, but the content under it doesn't relate to Millet's early life. That's a problem. 

So for Coherence Issues, the main point is the abrupt and unrelated paragraph about the Apache Reservation. Other minor issues might be slight transitions, but the main problem is that section. 

Fluency Issues: Maybe some complex sentences, but no errors. So Fluency score 4.5? Because it's highly fluent with minimal issues. 

Coherence Score: 3, because while most parts connect, the unrelated paragraph breaks coherence significantly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede readability.  
- [LEXICON] Formal, somewhat archaic vocabulary (e.g., "behoves," "disreputable") but no errors.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated paragraph about Apache Reservation disrupts thematic flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Mildly abrupt shifts between Milletâ€™s artworks and philosophic commentary.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
