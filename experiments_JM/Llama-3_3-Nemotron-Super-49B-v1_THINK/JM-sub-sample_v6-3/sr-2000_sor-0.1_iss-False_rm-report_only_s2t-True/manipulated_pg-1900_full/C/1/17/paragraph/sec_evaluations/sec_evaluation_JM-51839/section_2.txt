Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The text seems well-written overall. I need to check for any errors or awkward phrasing. Scanning through, I notice a few possible issues. For example, "the last work was the best" seems out of place in the Philip Nolan chapter. That line talks about Peter Ellis Bean's art moving forward, but the sentence structure here is abrupt and unclear in context. It might be a misplaced sentence or a typo. Another point: "somnolent peace" â€“ "somnolent" means sleepy, so "somnolent peace" might be a bit odd, though it's not strictly incorrect. Maybe "somnolent" was intended to describe a peaceful period, but it's a bit formal and might cause a slight pause. Also, in "Ermaso Seguin", I think it's a typo; should be "Erasmo Seguin". That's a spelling error. 

For Coherence, the text needs to have logical flow and connected ideas. The current segment has multiple chapters, each with distinct topics. However, transitions between these chapters might be abrupt. For example, moving from the Spanish Town chapter to Philip Nolan's expedition without a clear link. Each chapter starts abruptly without transitional phrases. Also, within the Mexican Revolution chapter, the mention of newspapers ("The Gazette" and "El Mejicano") feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the expedition details. It's mentioned as an interesting incident but doesn't fully integrate into the narrative flow. Another issue: in the Dr. James Long section, the statement about the boundary dispute and the reaction in Arkansas, etc., is clear, but the transition into Long's expedition could be smoother. The text jumps between different events without clear connectors.

Now, scoring. For Fluency, despite some minor issues (the misplaced sentence, possible typo, and a word choice), the text is mostly fluent. The errors are minor and don't disrupt reading much. So maybe a 4.5? But wait, the misplaced sentence about Peter Ellis Bean's art is confusing. If that's a content error, but under Fluency, it's more about expression. Since it's a sentence that doesn't fit, it affects clarity under Fluency's scope. So maybe that's a bigger issue. Let's say Fluency score 4 because there are a couple of distracting errors.

For Coherence, the structure is chronological but each chapter starts without transition. The ideas within each chapter are mostly logical, but the overall connectivity between sections is weak. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while each part is understandable, the transitions are lacking, causing some disjointedness.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "Somnolent peace" (uncommon phrasing may cause slight confusion)  
- [SPELLING] "Erasmo" (likely typo for "Erasmo Seguin")  
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence "It is not the least of his claims..." (disrupts flow, unclear context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt chapter shifts (e.g., Spanish Town to Philip Nolan) without connectors  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-integrated details (e.g., newspapers in Mexican Revolution chapter feel tangential)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
