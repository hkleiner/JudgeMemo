Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria. The text is the Current Segment, and I should ignore the Previous Section.

First, let's look at Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a quote from Lincoln followed by a discussion. The Lincoln quote seems correctly formatted with quotes and ellipses. Then there's a rhetorical question and references to various sources like the Jerusalem Talmud, Coleridge, and more. The structure here uses quotes and transitions between ideas. Are there any grammar or syntax issues? The sentences are complex but seem correctly structured. Maybe some long sentences, but they're properly punctuated. I don't notice spelling mistakes. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 5, but let me check again. Wait, there's a part where it says "the voice of Jerusalem must be heard again when the new world-order is shaping." The phrase "is shaping" might be a bit awkward; maybe "as the new world-order is taking shape" would be smoother. That's a minor issue. Also, the transition from talking about Judaism to the Afterword about Dr. Abrahams seems abrupt, but that's more a Coherence issue. For Fluency, the main problem might be that one slightly awkward phrasing. So Fluency score could be 4.5 because it's mostly fluent with a minor issue.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about how ideas connect. The text starts with Lincoln's quote, then questions about Judaism, references to Talmud, prophets, Coleridge's criticism, and then shifts to the need for Jews to fight under their own banner, referencing Blake and building Jerusalem. Then it quotes Nina Salaman and ends with the Afterword about Dr. Abrahams. The jump from the philosophical discussion to the Afterword seems disconnected. The Afterword talks about thanking speakers and eulogizing Arthur Davis, which doesn't directly relate to the preceding religious and Jewish mission topics. So there's a lack of transition between the main section and the Afterword. Within the main section, the ideas about Judaism's role and the need for unity are somewhat connected through quotes and rhetorical questions, but the shift to the Afterword is abrupt. Also, the sentence "It does not even pay--that prudent maxim..." might need a clearer connection to the previous thought. So Coherence issues include abrupt transition to Afterword and maybe some unclear connections between paragraphs. The Coherence score might be 3.5 because while the main part has some coherence, the ending part disrupts it significantly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward phrasing in "when the new world-order is shaping" (could use rephrasing for smoother flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition to "AFTERWORD" without clear connection to preceding themes  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit link between philosophical discussion and eulogy segment  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
