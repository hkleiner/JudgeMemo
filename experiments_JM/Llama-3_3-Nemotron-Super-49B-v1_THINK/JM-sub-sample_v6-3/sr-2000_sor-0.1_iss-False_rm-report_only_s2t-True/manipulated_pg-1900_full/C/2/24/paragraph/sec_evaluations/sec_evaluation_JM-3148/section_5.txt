Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is quite long, so I need to scan through it for any errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the text, the sentences are generally well-structured. There are some long sentences, but they seem to follow proper grammar. I notice some archaic language like "wa'n't" and "sence" (should be "since"), which might be intentional for the narrative voice. However, "sence" is a spelling error. Also, phrases like "so much so much so" in "so much so much so that..." is a repetition error. Those would affect fluency slightly. The use of dialect ("I’d ’a’ be’n") is consistent and probably intentional, so unless it's overly confusing, it's part of the style. So Fluency issues would include spelling mistakes and minor repetitions. The errors are minor but present, so maybe a 4? Because it's mostly fluent but has a couple of noticeable issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The segment starts talking about Aunt Hitty's funeral plans, then shifts to Lyddy's backstory, and then to her life after inheriting the house. The transition from the funeral discussion to Lyddy's history might feel a bit abrupt. For example, after describing the funeral and Aunt Hitty's comment, it jumps to "And this is the way that Lyddy Butterfield came into her kingdom..." without a clear connector. Then there's a detailed backstory about Lyddy's accident, her life as a governess, and finally her moving into the house. The chapter title and poem quote ("He shall daily joy dispense...") might disrupt the flow slightly, but they're part of the structure. Also, the last part about Aunt Hitty thinking Lyddy is a Goth seems disconnected from the preceding paragraphs about Lyddy's life. So Coherence issues include abrupt transitions between sections and some disjointed ideas. The story mostly follows a logical path, but there are noticeable shifts. So Coherence score might be a 3.5, as it's generally coherent but has some disruptions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "sence" (should be "since")  
- [REPETITION] "so much so much so"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from funeral planning to Lyddy’s backstory  
- [TRANSITION] Disconnected mention of Aunt Hitty’s criticism at the end  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
