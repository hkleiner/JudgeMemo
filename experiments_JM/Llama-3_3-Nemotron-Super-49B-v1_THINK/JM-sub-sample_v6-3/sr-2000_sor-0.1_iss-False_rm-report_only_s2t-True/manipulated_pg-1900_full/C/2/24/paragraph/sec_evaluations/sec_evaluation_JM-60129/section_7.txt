Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence.

Starting with Fluency. The text is a historical or anthropological description, so the language might be formal and include specific terms. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax issues. Scanning through, I notice some long sentences, but they seem structured. There are terms like "t'shu Huang-fan" which might be transliterations—assuming they're correct as per the source. No obvious spelling mistakes. The structure is mostly clear, though some sentences are complex. Maybe a few places where phrasing could be smoother, but overall, it's readable. I might deduct a bit for occasional awkwardness in long sentences but not major errors. So Fluency score around 4.

For Coherence, the text has several sections: historical background, tribe structure, customs. Each part seems to follow logically. However, there's a jump from administrative divisions to customs without a clear transition. Also, the list of "bones" with numbers might feel abrupt without context, but since it's a data point, maybe it's acceptable. The narrative moves from one topic to another (e.g., from demographics to marriage customs) without strong connectors, but each section is coherent on its own. Minor issues in transitions, so Coherence score maybe 4 as well, but need to check if the shifts are too abrupt. Since the sections are distinct topics, maybe it's mostly coherent with some minor weaknesses. So Coherence 4.

Wait, but the administrative division table might be confusing without explanation, but the text explains the Chinese names relate to horse taxes. Maybe that's okay. The main issue is the lack of transitional phrases between sections, but the content itself is logically organized. So Coherence score 4, Fluency 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "This movement is supposed to have taken place during Yungch’eng’s reign.")  
- [LEXICON] Specialized terminology (e.g., "t’shu Huang-fan," "t’umus") without immediate contextual explanation  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between thematic sections (e.g., administrative divisions to burial customs)  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense, unexplained lists (e.g., "bones" classifications)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
