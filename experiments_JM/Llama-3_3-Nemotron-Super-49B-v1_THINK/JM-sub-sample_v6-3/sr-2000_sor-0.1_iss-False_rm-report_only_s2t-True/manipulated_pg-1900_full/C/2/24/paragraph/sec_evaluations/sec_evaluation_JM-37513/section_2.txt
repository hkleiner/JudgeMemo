Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense and filled with complex philosophical concepts. The sentences are long and intricate, which might affect readability. I notice some grammatically correct but overly complicated structures. For example, phrases like "the great mechanical drama of evolution" or "the concomitant evolution of mind" are verbose. There's also repetition in ideas, like the discussion of "force" and its various uses, which could make the text feel a bit redundant. However, there are no obvious grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or major syntax issues. The vocabulary is sophisticated but appropriately used. So, the main fluency issues are related to phrasing and word choice making the text less smooth, but it's still mostly readable. Maybe a score of 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues.

Now, Coherence. The segment discusses Spencer's philosophy, his emphasis on evolution and the Unknowable. The structure seems to follow a logical path from explaining Spencer's views to comparing them with scientific approaches. However, there are abrupt transitions, like jumping from discussing the Synthetic Philosophy to the concept of the Unknowable without clear connectors. Some paragraphs feel a bit disjointed. For instance, the quote about Matter and Mind switches the focus abruptly. Also, the text assumes a lot of background knowledge about Spencer's work, which might confuse readers not familiar with it. Despite this, the overall narrative holds together, even if some connections between ideas are not perfectly smooth. So, coherence is mostly there but with some noticeable gaps. Maybe a score of 3.5 because it's generally coherent but has some transitions and assumptions that hinder flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary and phrasing (e.g., "unceasing redistribution of matter and motion," "the concomitant evolution of mind").  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "It is true that...").  
- [CLARITY] Repetitive elaboration on "force" without clear differentiation of meanings.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer’s legacy to quoting his formula without connective phrases.  
- [STRUCTURE] Assumption of prior knowledge about Spencer’s works (e.g., "the Synthetic Philosophy," "the Unknowable") without contextualization.  
- [LOGIC] Contrasting Spencer’s views with science’s scope feels tangential and unresolved.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
