Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately using the given scales.

Starting with Fluency. The definition mentions syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I need to check for errors or awkwardness. Scanning through the text, I notice some complex sentences, but they seem mostly well-structured. There's a mix of long and short sentences, which is good for flow. However, there are a few places where the phrasing might feel a bit archaic or less common, like "the poison of selfish despair did its work upon the heart of Kuei Ping." That's poetic but might slightly disrupt fluency for some readers. Also, terms like "hutungs" (probably "hutong," a Chinese alley) might require explanation, affecting clarity. Checking for grammar or spelling errors, I don't see any obvious ones. The punctuation looks correct. So Fluency is mostly good but with some minor issues, maybe a 4.

Now Coherence. This is about the overall logical flow and connection of ideas. The segment starts with Kuei Ping's preparations to leave, then her nighttime journey, prayer, sunrise reflection, and return with a new perspective. The transition from her desire for freedom to finding joy through self-forgetfulness seems logical. However, there are some abrupt shifts, like the mention of the "laser display turned off automatically" which feels out of place in the otherwise traditional setting. Also, the inclusion of sci-fi elements (auto-cleaning system, holographic map, laser display) in a historical context might confuse readers and disrupt coherence. Additionally, the shift from her resolve to leave to returning home with a changed heart needs smoother transitions. Some parts might feel a bit disjointed, but the overall narrative arc is clear. So Coherence might score a 3.5 due to those inconsistencies and jarring elements.

Wait, but the Coherence scale says Score 3 is generally coherent with noticeable issues. The sci-fi elements are definitely problematic here because they don't fit the time period, causing confusion. That's a major coherence issue. Also, the transition when she decides to return home after praying could be smoother. So maybe Coherence is a 3.

Fluency: The archaic language and some word choices might make it a 4, but the lack of errors keeps it from being lower. 

Finalizing: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.5? Or 3? Let me check again. The coherence issues are significant with the anachronistic terms, so maybe 3. But the rest of the narrative flows okay. Hmm. The laser display and other tech terms are major lapses in coherence because they break the historical context. That's a big problem. So Coherence score 3. Fluency remains 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaisms (e.g., "poison of selfish despair") and obscure terms (e.g., "hutungs") may hinder smooth readability. - [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, poetic phrasing (e.g., "the heart of a woman / is occupied / with one / desire") disrupts flow for modern readers.
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of anachronistic sci-fi elements (e.g., "laser display") disrupts historical context. - [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Kuei Pingâ€™s departure resolve to her return home lacks clear narrative bridge.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
