Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense, filled with philosophical concepts and references to Spencer and Bergson. The sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability. I notice some sentences are very long, like the one starting with "Whether we posit the present structure of mind..." That could be a syntax issue because of its length and complexity. Also, there are sudden shifts in topic, like the mention of "The iPhone was fully charged now." and "The robotic arm sorted the tools." These seem out of place and disrupt the flow. They might be errors or irrelevant additions. 

For grammar and punctuation, I didn't spot obvious errors, but the phrasing is sometimes awkward. For example, "Now to inquire into the Source or Sources of phenomena is characteristic of man as thinker." The structure here is a bit formal and might feel a tad stilted, but it's not incorrect. The word choice is mostly appropriate but sometimes verbose, which impacts fluency.

Now, Coherence. The text discusses Spencer's Unknowable versus Bergson's concepts, drawing comparisons. The structure seems logical, moving from distinctions between the thinkers to their shared quest for a Source. However, there are abrupt transitions, like the iPhone and robotic arm mentions, which don't connect to the surrounding philosophical discussion. These interruptions make the text feel less coherent. Also, some paragraphs jump between criticizing Spencer's methods and discussing Bergson's ideas without smooth transitions. For instance, the critique of Spencer's cause and effect treatment feels a bit disconnected from the preceding paragraphs about the Unknowable.

The main issues in Coherence are these sudden, unrelated sentences and some disjointed transitions between ideas. Despite the overall logical flow, these disruptions lower the coherence score.

For Fluency, the main problems are the long, complex sentences and the misplaced sentences. These cause the text to be less fluent, though it's still mostly readable. The score would be around 3.5 because while there are issues, the text doesn't have frequent grammatical errors.

For Coherence, the score is lower, maybe 3, due to the abrupt jumps and some unclear connections between paragraphs, even though the overall structure is logical.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Excessively long, complex sentences (e.g., "Whether we posit...")  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing (e.g., "simple thing which became diversified")  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt, unrelated sentences (e.g., "The iPhone was fully charged now.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unconnected examples (e.g., robotic arm, iPhone)  
- [LOGIC] Overly repetitive contrasts between Spencer and Bergson without clear resolution  
- [CLARITY] Dense, overly abstract paragraphs lacking connective tissue  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **3.5**
