Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text seems mostly well-written. I'll scan through for any errors. The sentence structure is generally good, but there are a few places where phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "the right to come and go as she chose through the compound door" is a bit wordy but correct. Another spot: "the duties were the same round of daily household tasks." "Round of" is a bit informal, but acceptable. Also, "tenfold thankful" is a correct expression. Checking for grammar errors—there's "the old lady told her bits of wisdom she had learned from her own living." Should be "from her own life," maybe? Wait, the original says "her own living"—that's a bit odd. "Living" here might be a typo for "life." That's a minor error but noticeable. 

Next, Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas flow logically. The segment starts with Kuei Ping's grief, then moves through her teaching, the school, the rebellion, financial struggles, and finally the school and church being established. The transitions between these sections seem mostly smooth. However, there's a shift when the narrator suddenly appears at the end, talking about being Kuei Ping's pupil. That part feels a bit abrupt. The narrator's section starts with "Wherein the narrator becomes Kuei Ping’s pupil..." which is a poetic introduction but disrupts the flow from the previous narrative about the school's establishment. It jumps from the village laying the cornerstone to the narrator's experience without a clear connection. Also, the last part about the fortune teller and the teacher feels like a new scene introduced late, which might confuse the coherence.

For Fluency score: Mostly fluent with minor issues. The error in "her own living" and some wordy phrases, but overall readable. So maybe a 4.

For Coherence: The main issue is the abrupt shift to the narrator's part. The rest of the narrative has some jumps (like from the school plans to the daughter's illness), but the biggest problem is the narrator's introduction disrupting the flow. So Coherence might be a 3.5 because while the main story is coherent, the ending part disrupts it.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "her own living" (likely should be "her own life")  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally wordy phrasing (e.g., "the same round of daily household tasks")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt narrative shift to the narrator’s perspective without clear transition  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of unrelated vignettes (e.g., fortune teller, painting lesson)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
