Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence separately. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written, but I notice a few issues. There's a mention of "a touchscreen blinked to life" and "A data stream flowed uninterrupted." These seem out of place in a historical context, probably anachronisms. That's a LEXICON problem because the words are modern and don't fit the time period. Also, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, the part about getting into bombarded towns has a long, winding structure. That's a SYNTAX issue. However, overall the grammar and spelling seem correct, so the fluency is mostly good but with some minor distractions. I'd rate Fluency a 4 because the issues are noticeable but don't disrupt much.

Now for Coherence. The segment jumps between different topics: describing Gerbéviller, talking about German planning, the attempt to go to Thann, and the incident at the hotel. These sections might not flow perfectly. The transition from discussing war strategy to the hotel scene feels a bit abrupt. That's a TRANSITION issue. Also, some parts like the story about Soeur Julie are mentioned but not elaborated, which might confuse without context. However, each individual part is clear, and the overall narrative has a logical thread, even if transitions could be smoother. Coherence would be a 4 as well because while there are some disconnects, the main ideas are mostly connected.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic terms ("touchscreen", "data stream") disrupt historical context.  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., lengthy explanations of access to war zones).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between descriptive scenes (e.g., Gerbéviller ruins to hotel customs).  
- [STRUCTURE] Partially unresolved tangents (e.g., Soeur Julie’s story hinted but not developed).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
