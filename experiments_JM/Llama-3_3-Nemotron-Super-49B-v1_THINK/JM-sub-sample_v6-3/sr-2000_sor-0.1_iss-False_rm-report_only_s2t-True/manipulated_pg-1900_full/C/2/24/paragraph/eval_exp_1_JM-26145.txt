Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the entire text's Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report. 

Starting with Fluency. Each section has a Fluency score. Let's look at the issues. Sections 1-3 and 5-8 have Fluency scores of 4.0, which is mostly fluent with minor issues. Section 04 has 3.5, with anachronistic terms and abrupt sentences. Section 09 is 3.5 with no Fluency issues listed. The common problems are complex sentence structures, archaic vocabulary, and some anachronisms (like hoverboard, drone). But most sections are 4.0. The worst Fluency is 3.5 in two sections, but overall, the majority are 4.0. So Fluency is generally good but with some noticeable issues. The scale says 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues. Since some sections have more than minor (like section 04's anachronisms), but they're not frequent across all sections. Maybe average around 4.0? But considering the recurring complex sentences and some lexical choices, maybe 3.8? But the allowed scores are half-points. Wait, the final score should be a single score. Let me think. If most sections are 4.0, but a couple are 3.5, and the issues are mostly minor but present in several sections, maybe the overall Fluency is 4.0. Because the problems don't disrupt readability much, just slow it sometimes.

Now Coherence. The scores vary more. Sections 1:3.5, 2&3:3.0, 4:3.0, 5:4.0, 6:3.5, 7:4.0, 8:3.5, 9:3.0. So a lot of 3.0 and 3.5 scores. Issues include abrupt transitions, shifts without connective tissue, anachronistic elements disrupting flow, and some tangential parts. The problems are more widespread. For example, section 04 has sudden modern elements, section 06 has a typo ("battery"), section 09 has "notification" and "fax". These are serious coherence issues because they disrupt the historical context. Also, many sections have transitions lacking clear connectors. Coherence scale: 3 is generally coherent but with noticeable issues affecting the experience. 3.5 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. Since there are multiple sections with 3.0 (more serious issues) and some higher, but the problems are recurring across most sections. The average might be around 3.3, but since we need a single score, considering the frequency of transitions and structure issues, maybe 3.2? But the options are half-points. The worst sections have 3.0, and some better ones. Since the issues are present in almost every section, even if not all are severe, the overall Coherence would be 3.0 or 3.5. Looking at the criteria: Score 3 is generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts. Score 3.5 is mostly coherent with a few weak parts. Given that many sections have coherence issues (like abrupt transitions, lack of connectors, anachronisms), but the text is still mostly followable, maybe 3.0 is more accurate because the problems are frequent enough to affect the reading experience noticeably.
