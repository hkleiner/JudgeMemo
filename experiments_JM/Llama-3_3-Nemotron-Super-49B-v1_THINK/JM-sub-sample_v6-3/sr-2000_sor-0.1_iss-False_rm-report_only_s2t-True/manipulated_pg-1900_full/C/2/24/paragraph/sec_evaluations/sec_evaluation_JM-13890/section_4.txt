Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to rate Fluency and Coherence on a Likert scale with half-points.

Starting with Fluency. The definition says it's about how the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, etc. The text is a historical narrative describing the events around Becket's murder and its aftermath. The language seems formal and somewhat archaic, which might be appropriate for the subject matter. Let me check for grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.

Looking through the text, the sentences are generally well-structured. There are long sentences, but they seem to flow okay. For example, "Taking up such an attitude in front of four men who had come hot-foot to Canterbury..." is a bit long but grammatically correct. I notice some complex sentence structures, like "The fear of sacrilege induced the knights to try to drag the defenceless Archbishop out of the Cathedral..." which uses subordinate clauses correctly. 

Are there any grammatical errors? I don't see obvious ones. The vocabulary is rich, with words like "impassioned," "gnashed," "twisting," which are correctly used. Punctuation looks correct, with commas and periods in the right places. Maybe some commas could be added for clarity in longer sentences, but it's not distracting. The only possible issue is the use of "half-civilized nations of the South and East" which might be considered slightly outdated or offensive, but that's more a content issue than fluency. Since the text is likely historical, the language style is acceptable. So Fluency might be a 5, but let me check again.

Wait, there's a sentence: "It is almost incredible how rapidly Becket became St. Thomas of Canterbury." The structure here is a bit formal but correct. Another part: "Dean Stanley adds another fact..." seems like a sudden shift, but it's introduced properly. Maybe some transitions could be smoother, but overall, the text is fluent. I think Fluency score is 5.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connectivity of ideas. The segment starts with the confrontation, then the murder, the immediate canonization process, the relics, and ends with the King's penance. Each part follows logically. The transition from the murder to the monks' reaction is smooth. Then discussing the relics and their value makes sense. The part about Roger stealing the relic might feel a bit abrupt, but it's connected to the theme of relics. Then moving to the King's penance connects back to the consequences of the murder. The only possible issue is the paragraph about Dean Stanley's fact feeling a bit like an aside, but it's relevant to Becket's austerity. The structure is mostly clear, with each paragraph addressing a sequential part of the story. Maybe the jump from the murder to the canonization is quick, but given it's a historical account, it's acceptable. Coherence score might be 5, but let me check for any disjointedness. The section about the King's penance in 1174 follows the narrative of consequences. All parts contribute to the overall story of Becket's death and aftermath. So Coherence is also 5.

Wait, but the Coherence scale says 5 is "highly coherent with clear progression." The text does have a clear sequence of events, each part leading to the next. The only minor point might be the detail about the hair-cloth shirt and vermin, but it supports the canonization aspect. No major gaps or illogical jumps. So both scores are 5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Occasional archaic phrasing ("hot-foot," "half-civilized nations") may slightly affect modern readability.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Minor abruptness in transitioning between historical events and detailed descriptions (e.g., vermin in Becketâ€™s shirt).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 5
