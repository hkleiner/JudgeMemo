Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the Fluency and Coherence of the given text using specific criteria. First, I need to go through the text carefully.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, including grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The text is from an older style, maybe early 20th century, given the writing style. I notice some long, complex sentences. For example, "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels." That's clear, but some sentences are quite long and convoluted, like the one describing Kuei Ping's thoughts about the mission school. The structure is mostly good, but the archaic language might make it a bit less fluent for modern readers. However, there are no obvious grammatical errors. The vocabulary is rich but sometimes uses less common words like "tapestried," "filigree," which might slow reading but aren't errors. So Fluency is high but not perfect due to sentence complexity and outdated language. Maybe a 4.5?

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how the whole text flows logically. The story seems to follow a clear sequence: introducing the Street of Precious Pearls, the procession, the shop visit, bargaining, and then a sudden shift to a memory of graduation day. That last part feels abrupt. The transition from the jewel shop to the mission school memory is sudden without a clear link. The rest of the narrative is well-connected, each part leading to the next logically. The abrupt jump in the last paragraph disrupts coherence, so Coherence might be a 4, since the main part is coherent but the ending disrupts it.

Wait, the transition to the graduation memory is abrupt. The text says "The hologram flickered to life. With a suddenness... she was back in memory..." Wait, "hologram" seems out of place in what appears to be a historical or traditional Chinese setting. That's a jarring anachronism. Also, the memory shift isn't signaled well, making it confusing. So Coherence issues here are the abrupt transition and the hologram mention which doesn't fit. That's a bigger issue. So maybe Coherence score is 3.5? Because the main part is coherent, but the ending has significant problems.

For Fluency, despite some long sentences and old-fashioned language, there are no errors, so it's mostly fluent. Maybe 4.5.

So final scores: Fluency 4.5, Coherence 3.5.

Checking the criteria again. For Fluency 4.5: "Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues." The text has natural phrasing but some complex sentences. Maybe 4.5 is right. For Coherence 3.5: "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts..." Yes, the end part is abrupt and the hologram is confusing. So 3.5 makes sense.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary and complex sentence structures may impede modern readability. - [SYNTAX] Occasionally lengthy, winding sentences (e.g., "The girl... had shown respect for Madame Yenâ€™s judgment.")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt, unforeshadowed shift to "hologram" and memory flashback without clear contextual link. - [LOGIC] Anachronistic "hologram" disrupts historical/ethnic setting.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
