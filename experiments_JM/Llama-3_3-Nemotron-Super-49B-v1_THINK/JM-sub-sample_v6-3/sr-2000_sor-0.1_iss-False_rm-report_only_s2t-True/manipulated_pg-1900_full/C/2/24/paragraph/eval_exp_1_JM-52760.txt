Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the text's Fluency and Coherence based on the section-wise report. Let's start with Fluency.

Looking at each section's Fluency scores: 

- Section 01: 4.5 (some wordy phrasing)
- Section 02: 4.0 (dense sentences, overly technical tone)
- Section 03: 4.0 (anachronistic term)
- Section 04: 3.5 (inconsistent terms, abrupt sentences)
- Section 05: 3.5 (anachronistic terms)
- Section 06: 4.5 (abrupt transitions, minor term issues)
- Section 07: 4.5 (complex sentences)
- Section 08: 4.5 (complex sentences)
- Section 09: 5.0 (no issues)

Most sections are around 4.0 or higher, except sections 4 and 5 which are 3.5. The main issues are occasional wordiness, dense structures, technical tone, anachronistic terms, and some abrupt sentences. But these are mostly minor. The lower scores in sections 4 and 5 are due to more disruptive anachronisms and informal sentences. However, the majority of the text is fluent with only minor issues. So Fluency is generally good but not perfect. Maybe a 4.0 overall? Wait, but sections 4 and 5 have 3.5. Let me check the criteria. Score 4 is "mostly fluent with minor issues not disrupting readability." Score 3 is "generally readable but multiple issues interrupting flow." Since most sections are 4 or above, and the issues in 4 and 5 are specific but not widespread, I think Fluency deserves a 4.0.

Now Coherence. Section scores:

- 01: 3.5 (abrupt sentence, historical context)
- 02: 3.5 (abrupt transition, anachronism, late introduction)
- 03: 4.0 (abrupt shift)
- 04: 3.0 (illogical phrases, chronological jumps)
- 05: 4.0 (abrupt timeline, weak connections)
- 06: 3.5 (dated battle list, weak links)
- 07: 5.0 (slight disconnect)
- 08: 4.5 (mildly abrupt shift)
- 09: 5.0 (none)

Coherence has more variability. Sections 01, 02, 04, 06 have lower scores (3.5 or 3.0) with issues like abrupt transitions, anachronisms, logical disruptions. Sections 03, 05, 08 are mid-range, and 07, 09 are perfect. The recurring problems are abrupt transitions, anachronistic elements disrupting context, and some logical inconsistencies. These are more impactful than Fluency issues because they affect the overall narrative flow. The criteria for Coherence score 3 is "generally coherent but noticeable abrupt shifts." Score 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak parts." Since several sections have significant coherence issues (especially sections 2 and 4), but others are good, maybe a 3.5 overall? Because while there are multiple sections with problems, they don't make the text incoherent overall, but they are frequent enough to lower the score below 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
