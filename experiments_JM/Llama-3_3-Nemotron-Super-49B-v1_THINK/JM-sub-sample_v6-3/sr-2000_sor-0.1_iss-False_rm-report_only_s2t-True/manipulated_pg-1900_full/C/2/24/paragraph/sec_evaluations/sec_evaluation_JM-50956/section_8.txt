Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to evaluate the current segment based on fluency and coherence. The current segment is: "Ostrich politics" may least of all be applied in dealing with that tremendous military and political factor which covers one-sixth of the land surface of the globe and is called Russia.

Starting with fluency. The sentence structure seems a bit complex. The phrase "may least of all be applied" might be a bit awkward. Is "least of all" correctly used here? It means that among all possibilities, this is the least applicable. But the structure "may least of all be applied" feels a little off. Maybe "is least applicable" would be clearer. Also, "dealing with that... factor" is a bit formal but not incorrect. The phrase "which covers one-sixth..." is a non-restrictive clause, properly set off by commas. No obvious grammar or spelling errors. The vocabulary is formal but appropriate. So fluency might be a 4 because the sentence is a bit convoluted but still clear.

For coherence, the current segment refers to "Ostrich politics," which implies avoiding reality. The context mentions considering future Russia's power. The current segment connects by saying that ignoring (ostrich politics) can't be applied when dealing with such a significant factor as Russia. The idea flows logically from the previous context about considering Russia's future influence. However, without the context, does this sentence stand alone coherently? It mentions "Ostrich politics" without defining it, assuming the reader knows what it means. But since the context is provided (though we're not evaluating it), the current segment relies on that context. However, the instruction says to evaluate the current segment on its own. So if someone reads just this sentence, would they understand the reference to "Ostrich politics"? Maybe not fully without knowing the preceding discussion about statesmen needing to consider future Russia. But the sentence itself logically argues that given Russia's size and importance, ignoring it (ostrich politics) isn't viable. The structure is logical: introducing a concept (ostrich politics) and applying it to Russia's significance. So coherence is good, maybe a 5 because it's clear and logical on its own once you understand the term. But wait, does it have any transitions or connections within itself? The sentence is a single complex sentence, but it's self-contained. So coherence score 5.

Wait, but the coherence definition includes logical progression and connections. Since this is a single sentence, maybe it's inherently coherent. Unless there's ambiguity. "Ostrich politics" is a metaphor, but common enough. The structure links the concept to Russia's characteristics. So coherence is strong. Fluency: the sentence is a bit long and complex, but no errors. So fluency 4.5? Or 4? The wording "may least of all be applied" is a bit formal and less common, which might affect fluency slightly. Maybe 4.5 because it's mostly fluent but has a slightly awkward phrasing.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] "May least of all be applied" is somewhat formal and less common phrasing, slightly affecting clarity.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [CLARITY] Assumes reader familiarity with "Ostrich politics" without explicit context in the segment.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
