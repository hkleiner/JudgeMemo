Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. The current segment is a narrative with dialogue. I notice some dialectical spellings like "t'ree" instead of "three" and "dere" for "there". These are intentional for character portrayal but might affect fluency slightly. However, they're consistent and common in such writing, so maybe not a major issue. Checking for grammar errors: the text seems mostly correct. There's a part where it says "the world went out" which is a bit abrupt, but it's a literary way to show fainting. Punctuation looks good. Maybe some long sentences, but they're structured well. So Fluency might be high, maybe a 4 or 4.5. 

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The segment starts with Bud deciding to act calmly, then the conversation with Ches, planning to get help, the ride, meeting the miners, and the rescue plan. The transitions between these scenes seem logical. Each part follows the previous one naturally. However, there's a shift from the tense situation at the tunnel to the miners' dialogue and then the frantic wagon ride. The description of the wagon trip is vivid but might feel a bit disconnected unless the reader understands the urgency. The captain's decision to timber might seem like a delay, but it's explained as necessary. The only potential issue is the abrupt switch in scenery (from Bud and Ches to the miners' party), but it's managed with "Captain Hanrahan's party were miners..." which provides context. So Coherence is strong, probably a 5, but maybe 4.5 if the scene changes are considered slightly abrupt without prior context.

Wait, the user mentioned that the text is part of a longer document, so some context might be missing, but we're to evaluate the segment on its own. The miners' introduction is clear enough within this segment. The logical flow from realizing the need for help, sending Ches, the miners responding, and then the rescue planning all connects well. So Coherence score is likely 5.

For Fluency, despite the dialect, it's fluent. The only minor issue might be the dialect causing slight pauses for some readers, but since it's consistent and used for characterization, it's acceptable. So Fluency score 4.5.

Finalizing: Fluency 4.5, Coherence 5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [LEXICON] Intentional dialectical spellings (e.g., "t'ree", "dere") may slightly impede readability for some readers.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Brief, abrupt scene shifts (e.g., minersâ€™ introduction) rely on contextual assumptions not fully resolved within the segment.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: **5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
