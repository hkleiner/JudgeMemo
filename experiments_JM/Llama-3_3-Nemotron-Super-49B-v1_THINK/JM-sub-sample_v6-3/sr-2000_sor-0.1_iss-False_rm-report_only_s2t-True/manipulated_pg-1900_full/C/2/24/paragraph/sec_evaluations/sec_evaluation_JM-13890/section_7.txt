Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the previous section even though it's given for context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. The text is quite descriptive and uses complex sentences. I notice that the writing is formal and rich in vocabulary, which is good, but there are some long, convoluted sentences. For example, the part about Archbishop Langton's tomb being partly inside and outside the chapel has a lot of clauses. That might make the flow a bit awkward. Also, there are a few places where the transition between ideas could be smoother. Like when it mentions "A 3D printer started humming" out of nowhere—that's jarring. Wait, but that's probably an error or a misplaced sentence. Similarly, "The smart glasses dimmed automatically" seems random. These interruptions break the fluency. However, overall, the grammar and spelling seem correct. The main issues are sentence structure complexity and those odd, unrelated sentences. So for Fluency, maybe a 4 because it's mostly fluent but has some minor issues, especially those abrupt tech references which are likely mistakes.

Now Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and connection of ideas. The text jumps between describing different parts of the cathedral, historical figures, and their monuments. While each paragraph seems to focus on a section (like the nave, the chapel, etc.), there are abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing the archbishop's attitude, it suddenly talks about a 3D printer and smart glasses, which don't belong. Those are probably errors in the text. Otherwise, the historical references are connected to the location, so the overall structure is mostly logical, but those anomalies disrupt coherence. Also, some transitions between paragraphs could be better. For instance, moving from the undercroft to the choir without a clear link. But generally, the narrative follows a spatial tour of the cathedral, which helps coherence. So Coherence might score a 3.5 because there are noticeable disruptions but the main flow is understandable.

Wait, but the evaluation criteria say to consider the section on its own. Those tech mentions are definitely out of place and cause coherence issues. So maybe Coherence is lower, like 3, because those parts are confusing and unrelated. But the rest of the text flows logically in describing the cathedral's features. Hmm. Need to balance. The main problems are those two sentences that don't fit at all. They cause abrupt jumps, so that's a coherence issue. Hence, Coherence score 3.5 might be right—generally coherent but with some noticeable problems.

Finalizing: Fluency has some complex sentences and those two errors, so 4. Coherence has those jarring elements but otherwise logical, so 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., multiple nested clauses).  
- [LEXICON] Abrupt, unrelated phrases ("A 3D printer started humming," "The smart glasses dimmed automatically").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unexplained shifts (e.g., modern tech references disrupt historical narrative).  
- [STRUCTURE] Minor disjointedness between spatial descriptions (e.g., jumps between chapel details and historical figures).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
