Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. The text is mostly well-written with proper grammar and syntax. However, there are a few places where the sentence structure is a bit complex or wordy. For example, the sentence "He sought for the colour of Rubens and Titian the drawing of Raphael, the splendour of design of Michelangelo, and the chiaroscuro of Rembrandt." is a bit long and could be broken up for better flow. Also, some transitions between paragraphs might feel a little abrupt, like moving from discussing his artistic influences to his approach with sitters. But overall, the language is formal and clear, with no major errors. So Fluency is likely a 4, maybe 4.5, but considering the occasional clumsiness, I'll go with 4.

Now for Coherence. The text seems to follow a logical structure, discussing Reynolds' later life, his artistic approach, and then analyzing his work's characteristics. However, there are some shifts, like the paragraph starting "Artists tell us that painting should be no more than a harmony of colour and line..." feels a bit disconnected from the preceding discussion about his techniques. It introduces a new idea about art vs. literature without a smooth transition. Also, the critique of his portraits of women versus courtesans might seem a bit abrupt. Despite this, the overall narrative holds together, so Coherence is probably a 4 as well. The issues are minor and don't disrupt the flow much.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., "He sought for the colour of Rubens...")  
- [TRANSITION] Mild abruptness between paragraphs (e.g., shift from artistic technique to "Artists tell us...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Slight thematic disjointedness (e.g., critique of female portraits feels somewhat isolated)  
- [TRANSITION] Minor lack of explicit connections between ideas (e.g., art vs. literature paragraph)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
