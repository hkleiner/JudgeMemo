Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current segment provided, ignoring the context. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, syntax, spelling, etc. The current segment is a narrative with dialogue and descriptive passages. Scanning through, I notice some complex sentences but they seem structured. However, there are a few places where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, the transition between Ramsey's thoughts and actions could be smoother. Also, some sentences are quite long and might disrupt the flow slightly. But overall, the grammar and spelling appear correct. No major errors spotted, so Fluency is likely a high score, maybe 4 or 4.5. But need to check for any specific issues.

Now Coherence. Coherence looks at how ideas connect and the overall logical flow. The segment switches between dialogue, actions, and Ramsey's internal thoughts. There's a part where Margot mentions being watched, and then the scene shifts to Ramsey's feelings and the kiss attempt. The transition here might feel a bit abrupt. Also, the introduction of the keyboard clicking without being touched feels a bit out of place without prior context, which might confuse readers. However, the overall narrative follows a logical sequence: they work on the ship, have interactions, and there's tension. But the abrupt shift in the boat scene and the unexplained keyboard sound could be coherence issues. So Coherence might score around 3.5 or 4, considering some minor disconnects but generally understandable.

Wait, the keyboard clicking is mentioned suddenly. Since the context isn't given, maybe that's a coherence issue because it's unclear why it happens. That could disrupt the flow. So maybe Coherence is a 3.5. For Fluency, despite some long sentences, the structure is mostly sound. Maybe a 4.5 for Fluency because the issues are minor.

Finalizing: Fluency 4.5 (mostly fluent, minor phrasing issues), Coherence 3.5 (some abrupt transitions and unclear elements like the keyboard).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structuring and overly long sentences (e.g., "He found himself liking Margot Dennison too much...").  
   - [LEXICON] Rare word choices (e.g., "man-tailored jumper," "digital fabric shifted colors") may slightly disrupt flow for some readers.  

2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Margot’s warning about being watched to Ramsey’s romantic actions (lacks clear logical connection).  
   - [CLARITY] Unexplained elements (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched") disrupt narrative coherence.  
   - [STRUCTURE] Internal monologues (e.g., Ramsey hiding thoughts) sometimes feel tangential to immediate plot.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
