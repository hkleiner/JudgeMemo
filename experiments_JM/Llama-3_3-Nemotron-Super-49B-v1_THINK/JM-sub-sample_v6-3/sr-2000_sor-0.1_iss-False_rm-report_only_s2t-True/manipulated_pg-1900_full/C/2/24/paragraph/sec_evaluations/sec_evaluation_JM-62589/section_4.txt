Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the Current Segment provided. The task is to assess Fluency and Coherence separately based on the given criteria.

Starting with Fluency. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, considering grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. I'll read through the current segment and note any issues. The text seems mostly well-structured. However, there are a few spots where the dialogue feels a bit forced or has awkward phrasing. For example, when Mason says, "Wha—at’s the matter—hic, going to turn your back on me..." The use of "Wha—at’s" might be trying to convey drunken slurring, but it's a bit unclear. Also, some sentences are long and complex, which might interrupt the flow slightly. But overall, the text is readable with minor issues.

Now for Coherence. Coherence looks at the logical flow and connection of ideas. The story here follows Robert's search for Mason, the encounter, and the conflict with the British soldier. The structure is mostly logical, but there's a part where the introduction of the Britisher in Robert's likeness feels a bit abrupt. The transition from Mason's plea to the sudden arrival of the lookalike could be smoother. Also, the line about the "personal hovercraft" seems out of place in a historical context, which might be a typo or anachronism, disrupting coherence.

For Fluency score: Mostly fluent with some minor phrasing issues. Maybe a 4. 

For Coherence score: Generally coherent but with some abrupt transitions and possibly an error (hovercraft). Around 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Forced dialogue phrasing (e.g., "Wha—at’s the matter—hic"). - [LEXICON] Anachronistic term ("personal hovercraft") disrupts historical context.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of British soldier resembling Robert. - [CLARITY] Sudden shift in tone during Mason’s plea and fight scene.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
