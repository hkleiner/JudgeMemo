2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of Moltke's plan without sufficient context in the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the war's outcome to criticizing Ludendorff's memoirs without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph discussing the outcome's dependency on troop movements).
