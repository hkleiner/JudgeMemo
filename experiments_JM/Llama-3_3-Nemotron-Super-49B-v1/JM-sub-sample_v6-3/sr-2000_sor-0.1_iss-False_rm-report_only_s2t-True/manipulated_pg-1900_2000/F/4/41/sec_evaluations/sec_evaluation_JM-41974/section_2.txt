Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Vjgorous" (likely "Vigorous"), "vsparkling" (likely "sparkling"), "thpse" (likely "those"), "afe" (likely "are")
- [LEXICON] "enamoured of the bright andvsparkling side of life" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "Allnthese masters" (likely "All these masters", missing space)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Veronese's work to discussing his private life without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Accordingly no one could justly appraise Veronese,bwithout first setting aside, as he did, all those historic data which he voluntarily ignored." feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding paragraph's focus.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
