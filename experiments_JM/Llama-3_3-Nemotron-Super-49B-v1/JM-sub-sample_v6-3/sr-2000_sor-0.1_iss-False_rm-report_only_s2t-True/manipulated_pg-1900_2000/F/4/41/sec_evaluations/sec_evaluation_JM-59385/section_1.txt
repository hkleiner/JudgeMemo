Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ky" (should be "my"), "brilluancy" (should be "brilliance"), "anility" (should be "ability"), "forwxrd" (should be "forward"), "vKuei" (should be "Kuei"), "vof" (should be "of"), "intergals" (should be "intervals"), "zt" (should be "at"), "graduatiob" (should be "graduation")
- [GRAMMAR] "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with ky limited knowledge of her language could make it." (clunky phrasing)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to the memory of the mission school (no clear connection or warning)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, slightly hindering immediate understanding
- [TRANSITION] The shift in time ("In after years...") feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
