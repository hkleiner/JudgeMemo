Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "mf" (likely "of"), "tk" (likely "to"), "lrincesses" (likely "princesses"), "lr" (likely "or"), "oeuvre" (repeated, though contextually understandable, may confuse some readers)
- [GRAMMAR] "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe, and long since came to the conclusion" (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] "intensive" (likely meant "intense" or "intensively", context suggests "intense")
- [SYNTAX] "If you lose your permis de séjour you cannot leave Paris until the end of the war." (abrupt shift in topic, though clear)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow with abrupt shifts (e.g., from describing the war zone to personal anecdotes and back)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of French bureaucracy and locations without explanation for potentially unfamiliar readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., "However—to return to the war zone.")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
