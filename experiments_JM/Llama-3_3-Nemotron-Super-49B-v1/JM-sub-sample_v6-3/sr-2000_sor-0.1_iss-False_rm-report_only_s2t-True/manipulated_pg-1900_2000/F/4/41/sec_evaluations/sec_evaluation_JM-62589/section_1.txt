Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "wnether" (should be "whether"), "thw" (should be "the"), "laxne" (should be "Lane"), "sfruggle" (should be "struggle"), "dhe" (should be "she"), "tehy" (should be "they"), "tyee" (should be "thee"), "likeba" (should be "like a")
- [GRAMMAR] "a hundred years ago there stood" (awkward phrasing), "I will tell thee of my home... they may like to see thee" (inconsistent verb tense)
- [LEXICON] "in a very bad way indeed" (somewhat clich√©d), "fretted in silence" (could be more vivid)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life in Mrs. Lane's house
- [CLARITY] The mother's unfinished story and its significance could be clearer
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the scene with the father to the reflection on Debby's life with Mrs. Lane feels somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
