Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Multiple typos (e.g., "pefcceived", "cleberness", "prgan", "mt", "reaeon", "pccasion", "tbe", "unsppkrted", "don'f", "agaib", "appeqred", "wjth")
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some outdated or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between the end of Chapter I and the beginning of Chapter II without clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., "The impression he made on me personally was such that I wished him to read it, and I corrected to this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless conspicuity of the sheet.")

Section section_02 (Chars 7709–11221):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Multiple typos (e.g., "yoy", "havad", "saa", "xo", "disxppointment", "intermknable")
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the liberty had been taken wjth myself" in context, though not in the evaluated segment, sets a tone; in the segment: "I had had on my tongue’s end" feels slightly archaic or awkward in this context)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "unmodulated", while correct, may cause a slight pause for some readers)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift in scene (from the fireplace to dinner) without clear transitional phrases
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Vereker's character reaction ("Oh, it’s all right—the usual twaddle!") could be more clearly motivated or set up for maximum impact
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The connection between Lady Jane's pleasure and the dinner scene could be smoother
