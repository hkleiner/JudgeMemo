Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "thou", "thee") and less common vocabulary (e.g., "argosy", "brazen autocracy") might challenge some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from critiquing biblical passages to comparing with modern sentiments (e.g., the Englishwoman's statement) without clear transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different biblical references and modern examples without a clearly defined, cohesive flow.
