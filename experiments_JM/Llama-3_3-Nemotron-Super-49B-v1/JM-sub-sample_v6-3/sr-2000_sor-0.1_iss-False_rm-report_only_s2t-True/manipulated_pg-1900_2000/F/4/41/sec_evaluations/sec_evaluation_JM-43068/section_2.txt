- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "he is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise for enhanced clarity (e.g., "that great indefinable something")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and subject matter without clear transition (e.g., from discussing "La Baigneuse" to declaring Millet "more a philosopher than a painter")
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder immediate understanding (e.g., the detailed description of the sunset in "The Sheep Pen")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from "La Baigneuse" analysis to the philosophical description of Millet)
