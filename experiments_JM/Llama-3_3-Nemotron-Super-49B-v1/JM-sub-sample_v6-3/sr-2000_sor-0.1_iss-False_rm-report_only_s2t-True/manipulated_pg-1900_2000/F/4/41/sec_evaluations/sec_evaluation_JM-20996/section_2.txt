Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "midsg", "ws", "clme", "fod", "whkch", "southrrn", "Tye", "pdeatrians", "leggins", "Calfutta")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor subject-verb agreement and tense consistency issues (e.g., "the strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth" could imply an ongoing action in the past, which is slightly awkward)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are slightly formal or less common (e.g., "in the midsg of", "excessive disagreeableness"), but do not hinder understanding

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing personal discomfort to historical context of Manila without a clear connector
- [CLARITY] The list of people on the bridge, while vivid, slightly disrupts the flow due to its length and detail, potentially overwhelming the reader
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the bridge scene to the notice about teachers' assignments feels abrupt and could benefit from a smoother transition or clearer connection to the preceding narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
