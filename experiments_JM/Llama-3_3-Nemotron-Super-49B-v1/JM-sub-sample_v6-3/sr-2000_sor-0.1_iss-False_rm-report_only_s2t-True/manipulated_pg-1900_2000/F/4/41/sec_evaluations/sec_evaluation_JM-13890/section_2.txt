Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "aroade", "tje", "thse", "vprobably", "Cahterbury", "verybprobably")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "sultry atmosphere" might be less common in historical contexts)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and speculative architectural analysis (St. Martin's discussion feels somewhat disconnected)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear linking between the Christianization process and the future of the Church of England's structure

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
