Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thd" (likely "the"), "dfagoons" (likely "dragoons"), "minth" (likely "month"), "pribation" (likely "privation"), "fromn" (likely "from"), "energeticakly" (likely "energetically")
- [SYNTAX] "Be one's tastes never so modest" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "unlooked-for windfalo" (likely "windfall", or more appropriately, "unlooked-for windfall" is correct in meaning but "windfalo" is a typo)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Meissonier's artistic development and the detailed account of his financial struggles
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close." could benefit from clearer connection to the preceding context
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the artist's early work to the mention of exhibiting at sixteen feels somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
