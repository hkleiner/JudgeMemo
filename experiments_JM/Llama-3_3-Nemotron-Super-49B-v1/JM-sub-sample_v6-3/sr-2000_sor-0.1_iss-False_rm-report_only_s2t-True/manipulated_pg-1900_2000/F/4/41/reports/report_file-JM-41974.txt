  Fluency Issues:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • "salutary exigencies of technique" (slightly archaic phrasing), "facilirated" (should be "facilitated"), "tei" (not present, assumed typo for "the" or similar, but not found in provided text; removed as it seems to be an error in the list)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's style to his birth and family background without a clear connecting sentence.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The sentence "Strange caprice on the part of an artist..." could be clearer in its connection to the preceding text.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from Veronese's early life to his professional successes feels somewhat abrupt.

        • The sentence "Accordingly no one could justly appraise Veronese,bwithout first setting aside, as he did, all those historic data which he voluntarily ignored." feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding paragraph's focus.
