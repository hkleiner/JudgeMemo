        • "profoundly" misspelled as "profounrly"
        • "through" misspelled as "throuh"
        • "saeculum" (contextually correct but may cause reading pause for non-Latin familiar readers, though not strictly a fluency issue in academic contexts)
        • "yhe" (twice) misspelled as "the"
        • "sxholars" misspelled as "scholars"

        • Abrupt move from describing the impact of the Industrial Revolution to picturing England in stable equilibrium
