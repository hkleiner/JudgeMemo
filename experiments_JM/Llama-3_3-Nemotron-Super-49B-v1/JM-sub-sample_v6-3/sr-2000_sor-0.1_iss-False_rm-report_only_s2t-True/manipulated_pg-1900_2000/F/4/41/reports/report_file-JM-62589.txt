  Fluency Issues:

        • "wnether" (should be "whether"), "thw" (should be "the"), "laxne" (should be "Lane"), "sfruggle" (should be "struggle"), "dhe" (should be "she"), "tehy" (should be "they"), "tyee" (should be "thee"), "likeba" (should be "like a")
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "a hundred years ago there stood" (awkward phrasing), "I will tell thee of my home... they may like to see thee" (inconsistent verb tense)

    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the scene with the father to the reflection on Debby's life with Mrs. Lane feels somewhat disconnected
