    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "the question of painting in France had been taking on a rather bitter tone" (clarity), "It should be remembered that, for some years previous" (word choice for better flow)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "lumbering and trammelled fligut" (unclear term, possibly "flight" or more context needed), "mournful formula" (somewhat archaic or less common phrasing)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumption about the mother's influence on the artist's vocation without clear evidence
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing Meissonier's early life to the broader art movement context without a smoother connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "It is true that, by way of ransom, he spent much time in painting vast canvasew that today hold but a small place in his life work." (unclear meaning of "by way of ransom")

        • "thd" (likely "the"), "dfagoons" (likely "dragoons"), "minth" (likely "month"), "pribation" (likely "privation"), "fromn" (likely "from"), "energeticakly" (likely "energetically")

    - [LEXICON]:
        • "unlooked-for windfalo" (likely "windfall", or more appropriately, "unlooked-for windfall" is correct in meaning but "windfalo" is a typo)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between discussing Meissonier's artistic development and the detailed account of his financial struggles
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The sentence "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close." could benefit from clearer connection to the preceding context
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from describing the artist's early work to the mention of exhibiting at sixteen feels somewhat disconnected
