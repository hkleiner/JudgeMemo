Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "ith" instead of "is", "wcaly" instead of "scaly", "tge" instead of "the", "Ramset" instead of "Ramsey", "atvthe" instead of "at the", "foyr" instead of "four")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "planetarithed" instead of a more common term like "nationalized")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "He was a big man even by Earth standards, which meant he towered over the Irwadian's green, wcaly head.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Ramsey's departure and the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sections assume prior knowledge (e.g., the significance of titanium, the implications of planetarization) without sufficient context for immediate understanding
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the scene with Chind Ramar to "So that's about the size of it," Ramsey finished, feels disconnected without a clearer link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
