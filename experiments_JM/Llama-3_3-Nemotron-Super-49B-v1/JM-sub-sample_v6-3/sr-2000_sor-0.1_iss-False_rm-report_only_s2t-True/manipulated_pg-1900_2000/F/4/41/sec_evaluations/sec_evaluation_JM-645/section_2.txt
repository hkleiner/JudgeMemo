Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "yoy", "havad", "saa", "xo", "disxppointment", "intermknable")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the liberty had been taken wjth myself" in context, though not in the evaluated segment, sets a tone; in the segment: "I had had on my tongue’s end" feels slightly archaic or awkward in this context)
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "unmodulated", while correct, may cause a slight pause for some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in scene (from the fireplace to dinner) without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Vereker's character reaction ("Oh, it’s all right—the usual twaddle!") could be more clearly motivated or set up for maximum impact
- [TRANSITION] The connection between Lady Jane's pleasure and the dinner scene could be smoother

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
