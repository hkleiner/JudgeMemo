Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Multiple typos (e.g., "ith" instead of "is", "wcaly" instead of "scaly", "tge" instead of "the", "Ramset" instead of "Ramsey", "atvthe" instead of "at the", "foyr" instead of "four")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "planetarithed" instead of a more common term like "nationalized")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "He was a big man even by Earth standards, which meant he towered over the Irwadian's green, wcaly head.")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between Ramsey's departure and the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sections assume prior knowledge (e.g., the significance of titanium, the implications of planetarization) without sufficient context for immediate understanding
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the scene with Chind Ramar to "So that's about the size of it," Ramsey finished, feels disconnected without a clearer link

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with Englander to the gambling scene
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some character motivations (e.g., the drunk Irwadian's sudden hostility) could be more clearly established
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of clear temporal connection between scenes (e.g., how much time passes between leaving Englander's and arriving at the gambling hall)
