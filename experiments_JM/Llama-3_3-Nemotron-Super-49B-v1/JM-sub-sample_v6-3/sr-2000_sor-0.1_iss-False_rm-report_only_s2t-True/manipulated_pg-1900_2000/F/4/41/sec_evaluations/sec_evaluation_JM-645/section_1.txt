- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of Chapter I and the beginning of Chapter II without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., "The impression he made on me personally was such that I wished him to read it, and I corrected to this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless conspicuity of the sheet.")
