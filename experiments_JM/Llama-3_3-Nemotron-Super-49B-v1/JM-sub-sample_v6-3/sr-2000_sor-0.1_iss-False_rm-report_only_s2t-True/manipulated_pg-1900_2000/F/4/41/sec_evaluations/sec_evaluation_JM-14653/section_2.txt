Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "byndevotees" (likely "by devotees"), "naught" (archaic, may cause reading pause), "vcentury" (likely "century"), "mtheir" (likely "their"), "faitg" (likely "faith"), "nwarly" (likely "nearly")
- [LEXICON] Use of less common words ("ebullition", "self-expression in general") may slightly impede flow for some readers
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in paragraphs 5 and 6 may require re-reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that skepticism automatically leads to a loss of all faith (oversimplification)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing 19th-century scientists to the impact on Christmas spirit (could be smoother)
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties" is somewhat vague

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
