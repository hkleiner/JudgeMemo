1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Plamj" (likely "Plank"), "Cohrt" (likely "Court"), "towarx" (likely "toward"), "Poiny" (likely "Point"), "frombthe" (likely "from the"), "unofdicially" (likely "unofficially"), "conswcutively" (likely "consecutively"), "nagural" (likely "natural"), "transpodtation" (likely "transportation"), "cith" (likely "city"), "Bermuda Hundredcto" (likely "Bermuda Hundred to")
- [GRAMMAR] "were conswcutively numvered" (subject-verb agreement and spelling), "would require more than 10 times as many men" (clarity in comparison)
- [LEXICON] "horse soldiers" (informal in a formal context, though not incorrect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing infrastructure to introducing the "BATTLE OF PETERSBURG" chapter without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] The shift from discussing defensive preparations to the Union's attack plan feels somewhat disconnected without a transitional sentence.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of a clear transitional phrase or sentence connecting the end of the defensive preparations description with the start of the battle narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
