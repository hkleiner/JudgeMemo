Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "consisying", "quartsr", "hax", "reawaken" is correct but "roamed at liberty about her room" could imply a lack of enclosure which might not be the intended meaning, however, this is more of a clarity issue)
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "dragged her successively", "whete Raymond Bonheur")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise for modern readers (e.g., "desperate energy", "obstinate and persistent study" is clear but could be more concise)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing art principles and moving to the Rue Rumford location
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in sentence structure (e.g., "the time thus spent cannot fail to be profitable in the future" could be clearer in its connection to the preceding sentence)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between paragraphs (e.g., from studio work to living situation, and then to animal studies)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
