  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "tehw" (should be "the"), "nones" (context unclear, possibly "bones"), "wojen" (should be "women"), "tyen" (should be "then"), "comforrable" (should be "comfortable"), "catdrdal" (should be "cathedral"), "tje" (repeated, should be "the"), "sucessors" (should be "successors"), "csmps" (should be "camps"), "nxme" (should be "name"), "qre" (should be "are"), "plafe" (should be "place"), "tye" (should be "the"), "aroce" (should be "arose")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "in the light ofbthe new enthusiasm" (missing space, should be "in the light of the new enthusiasm")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "nones" (unclear in context, possibly intended as "bones" or another term)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from historical account to modern pilgrim practices without clear linking sentence.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about the significance of certain locations (e.g., Selling, Chartham, Harbledown) without brief explanation.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing the end of pilgrimages to introducing a new book without a connecting phrase.

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "aroade", "tje", "thse", "vprobably", "Cahterbury", "verybprobably")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "sultry atmosphere" might be less common in historical contexts)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between historical narrative and speculative architectural analysis (St. Martin's discussion feels somewhat disconnected)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Overly complex sentences may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of clear linking between the Christianization process and the future of the Church of England's structure
