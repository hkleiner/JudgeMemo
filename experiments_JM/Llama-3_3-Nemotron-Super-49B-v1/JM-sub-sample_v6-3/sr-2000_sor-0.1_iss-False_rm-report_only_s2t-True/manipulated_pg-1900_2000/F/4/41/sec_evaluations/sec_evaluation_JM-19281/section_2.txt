Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "hiatorical" (should be "historical"), "definabke" (should be "definable"), "ot" (should be "of"), "thd" (should be "the"), "sysrems" (should be "systems"), "wgat" (should be "what")
- [GRAMMAR] "the proliferation even of cults and practices that may arouse aversion in the minds of many serves primarily as a reminder" (complex sentence structure may impede immediate clarity for some readers)
- [LEXICON] "haply" (archaic, may reduce readability for some)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the failure of materialism directly leads to a resurgence in spiritual/religious interest without fully exploring alternative factors
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing spiritual searches to critiquing materialist enterprises without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The paragraph starting with "The most obvious cause..." assumes a high level of background knowledge on "scientific materialism" and its impacts, potentially confusing less informed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
