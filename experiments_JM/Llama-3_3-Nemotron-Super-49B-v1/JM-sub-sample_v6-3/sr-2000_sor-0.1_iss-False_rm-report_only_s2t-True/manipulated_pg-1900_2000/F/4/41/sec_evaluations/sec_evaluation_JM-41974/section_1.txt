2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's style to his birth and family background without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Strange caprice on the part of an artist..." could be clearer in its connection to the preceding text.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Veronese's early life to his professional successes feels somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
