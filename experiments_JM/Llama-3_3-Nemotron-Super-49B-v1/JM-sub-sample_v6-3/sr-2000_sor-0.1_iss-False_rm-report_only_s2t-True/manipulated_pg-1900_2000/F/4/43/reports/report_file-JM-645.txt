  Fluency Issues:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between past and present reflections without clear transitional markers (e.g., the shift from discussing the review to the visit at Bridges).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • A few instances where the protagonist's thoughts or intentions are not immediately clear (e.g., the exact motivation behind wanting Vereker to read the review).
