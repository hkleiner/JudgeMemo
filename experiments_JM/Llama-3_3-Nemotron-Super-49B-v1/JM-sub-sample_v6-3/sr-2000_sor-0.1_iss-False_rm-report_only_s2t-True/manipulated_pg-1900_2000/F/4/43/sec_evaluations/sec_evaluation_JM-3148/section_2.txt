- [LEXICON] "incarnate Why and How" (Unconventional phrasing, though poetic, may disrupt flow for some readers)
- [SPELLING] None detected in the current segment, but "catgut" in the context (if considered) is less common, though not a spelling error.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Tony's punishments to his philosophical questions without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in tone from descriptive narrative to introspective questioning.
- [CLARITY] The sentence starting with "If which had divine..." is nearly incomprehensible due to its structure and wording.
