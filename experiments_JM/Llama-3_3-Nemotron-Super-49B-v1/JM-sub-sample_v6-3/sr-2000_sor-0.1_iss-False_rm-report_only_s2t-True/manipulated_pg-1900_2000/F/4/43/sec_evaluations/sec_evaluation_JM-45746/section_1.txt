Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Finally the day of graduation arrived. I definite was a the college with world a was into unprepared ready, diploma go to out for but position." (incoherent sentence structure and word choice)
- [SPELLING] "definite" (likely should be "definitely"), "unprepared" (context suggests "unprepared" might not be the intended word)
- [SYNTAX] "We explained unfinished might next gymnasium, used leaving, which for had superintendent it be; visited, room were plans he using since made the a but, no it a they for." (extremely disjointed and unclear)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the author's entry into teaching to the story of the two young men without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time frames and storylines (author's past, the two young men's stories, and back to the author's advice) without smooth transitions.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of contrasting the two young men's approaches to teaching isn't immediately clear in relation to the preceding narrative about the author's entry into the profession.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
