  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "Finally the day of graduation arrived. I definite was a the college with world a was into unprepared ready, diploma go to out for but position." (incoherent sentence structure and word choice)
    - [SPELLING]:

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "We explained unfinished might next gymnasium, used leaving, which for had superintendent it be; visited, room were plans he using since made the a but, no it a they for." (extremely disjointed and unclear)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing the author's entry into teaching to the story of the two young men without clear connection.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between different time frames and storylines (author's past, the two young men's stories, and back to the author's advice) without smooth transitions.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The purpose of contrasting the two young men's approaches to teaching isn't immediately clear in relation to the preceding narrative about the author's entry into the profession.
