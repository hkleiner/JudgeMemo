Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "aman I lass come" (incoherent phrase, likely a typo or transcription error)
- [SYNTAX] "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "swaying figure" (could be more descriptive for better imagery)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life in Mrs. Lane's house without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling within the chapter (jumps between past and present without clear transitions)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
