Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "manias", "scaffolding of all her works") might require a brief pause for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between artistic development, personal life, and career milestones without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the significance of certain artistic principles (e.g., "honesty in art depends upon line-work") are made without elaboration for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
