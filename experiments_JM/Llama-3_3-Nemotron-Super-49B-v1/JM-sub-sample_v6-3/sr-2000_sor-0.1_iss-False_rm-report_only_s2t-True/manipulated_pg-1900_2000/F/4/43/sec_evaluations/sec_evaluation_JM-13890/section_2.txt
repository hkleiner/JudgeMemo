2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Canterbury's historical significance to speculating about the future of the State Church without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods (from Augustine's landing to modern times) without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about St. Martin's church seems somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative about Canterbury's ecclesiastical importance
