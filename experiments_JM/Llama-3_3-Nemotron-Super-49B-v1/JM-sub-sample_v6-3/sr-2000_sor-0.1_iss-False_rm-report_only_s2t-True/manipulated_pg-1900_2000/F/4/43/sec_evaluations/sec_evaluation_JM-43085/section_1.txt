Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in "Accordingly battle a really, he with because, not what did he, that decided painted he was certain loftiness none know a!"
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "trammelled flight", "lumbering")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical error in "the mere sight of a picture often takes our attention from our serious duties" (should be "takes" -> "take" for subject-verb agreement, but this is a quote and thus might be intentional for authenticity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to introducing Eugène Delacroix without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Meissonier's anecdote to his birth and early life without a smooth transition
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Such is not destined to be the rôle of Meissonier! His so so a immense a neither, nor struggle tragic was triumph." is unclear and seems to have typographical errors

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
