Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (apostrophe usage could be improved for clarity, though not strictly incorrect)
- [LEXICON] "somewhat extreme" (vague; could be more descriptive)
- [SYNTAX] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close..." (somewhat formal/archaic phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing attire to the need for good general education
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and loosely connected anecdotes/examples
- [CLARITY] The purpose of contrasting the two applicants (young man vs. woman) could be more explicitly stated
