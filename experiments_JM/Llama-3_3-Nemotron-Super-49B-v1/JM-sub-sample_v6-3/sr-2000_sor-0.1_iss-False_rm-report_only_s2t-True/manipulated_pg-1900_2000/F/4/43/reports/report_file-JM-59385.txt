Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Not until the selected heap was before her did Madame Yen speak of price...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary might reduce readability for all audiences (e.g., "tearoom-like", "padded shoes", "drooping moustaches").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative's non-linear progression, while effective, might slightly disorient some readers without clearer contextual cues.

(Severely disjointed sentence structure)
    - [LEXICON]:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition from describing the memory of the pearl to the disjointed, unclear sequence of events/sensations (first paragraph of the current segment)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Non-linear narrative jumps without clear connectors, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., sudden shifts between past memories and present actions)
