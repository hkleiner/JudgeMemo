Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "Closing sank window to she began down door and in real the the think near earnest." (incoherent sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "in real the the think" (repetitive and unclear phrase, likely typo)
- [LEXICON] "quiver" (while not incorrect, somewhat formal or less common choice for "shiver" in this context, may slightly affect flow for some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Debby's thoughts to historical events (Bunker Hill, Lexington) without clear connection to her immediate emotional state or previous thoughts.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of Debby's hatred for the King without prior buildup or clear motivation beyond spite for Mrs. Lane.
- [STRUCTURE] The section ends somewhat abruptly with the setup for Mrs. Lane's return, without fully resolving Debby's thoughts or emotions from the day's events.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
