  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "aman I lass come" (incoherent phrase, likely a typo or transcription error)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence" (awkward phrasing)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "swaying figure" (could be more descriptive for better imagery)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life in Mrs. Lane's house without a clear connector.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Non-linear storytelling within the chapter (jumps between past and present without clear transitions)

Section section_02 (Chars 7793–11759):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "Closing sank window to she began down door and in real the the think near earnest." (incoherent sentence structure)
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "in real the the think" (repetitive and unclear phrase, likely typo)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "quiver" (while not incorrect, somewhat formal or less common choice for "shiver" in this context, may slightly affect flow for some readers)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt shift from Debby's thoughts to historical events (Bunker Hill, Lexington) without clear connection to her immediate emotional state or previous thoughts.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden introduction of Debby's hatred for the King without prior buildup or clear motivation beyond spite for Mrs. Lane.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The section ends somewhat abruptly with the setup for Mrs. Lane's return, without fully resolving Debby's thoughts or emotions from the day's events.
