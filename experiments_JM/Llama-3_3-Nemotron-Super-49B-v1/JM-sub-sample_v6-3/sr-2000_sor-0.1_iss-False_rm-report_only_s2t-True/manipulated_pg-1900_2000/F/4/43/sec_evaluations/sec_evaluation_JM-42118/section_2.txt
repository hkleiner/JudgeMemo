Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "At the end of six months he called again upon Boucher, his sketches under his arm; and this time he was not sent away." (Lack of clear transition)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary for general readability (e.g., "consummate master", "large-hearted")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "painted them, day by day, from memory." (Should be "painted them day by day from memory" or with articles for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's training to the Director-General's death and its consequences
- [CLARITY] Unclear timeline in the sequence of events (e.g., the exact timing of Fragonard's work with Boucher and his own projects)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between Fragonard's artistic development and the political events described

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
