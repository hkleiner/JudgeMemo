2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing the memory of the pearl to the disjointed, unclear sequence of events/sensations (first paragraph of the current segment)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps without clear connectors, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., sudden shifts between past memories and present actions)
