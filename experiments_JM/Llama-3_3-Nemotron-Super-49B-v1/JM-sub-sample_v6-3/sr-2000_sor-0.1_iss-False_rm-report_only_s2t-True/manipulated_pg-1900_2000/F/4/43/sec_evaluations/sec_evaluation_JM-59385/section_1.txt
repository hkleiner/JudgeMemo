Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Not until the selected heap was before her did Madame Yen speak of price...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might reduce readability for all audiences (e.g., "tearoom-like", "padded shoes", "drooping moustaches").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition).
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative's non-linear progression, while effective, might slightly disorient some readers without clearer contextual cues.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
