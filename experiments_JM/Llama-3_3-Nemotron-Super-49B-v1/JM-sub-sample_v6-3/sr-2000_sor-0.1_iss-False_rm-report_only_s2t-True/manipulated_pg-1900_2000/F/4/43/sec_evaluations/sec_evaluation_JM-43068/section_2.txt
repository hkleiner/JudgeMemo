Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "His the the and and his at was divided his work in children between man interest wife m√©nage."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may impede smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "opalescent hues", "suffuses")
- [GRAMMAR] Repetitive use of "and" in the aforementioned sentence, disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's artistic style to his personal life and philosophic nature without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the peasant's labour and "The Sheep Pen" could benefit from clearer linking to the preceding discussion on Millet's mood in "La Baigneuse"
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analyzing specific artworks, Millet's personality, and his life circumstances without a consistent narrative thread

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
