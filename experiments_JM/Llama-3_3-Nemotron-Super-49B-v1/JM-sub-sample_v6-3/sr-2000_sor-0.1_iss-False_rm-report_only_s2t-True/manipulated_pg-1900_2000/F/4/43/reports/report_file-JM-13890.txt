Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "Perhaps site Saxon until the Martin it early 's, very on part discoveries St. will seems but standing inby of as be a solved very wiser problem Roman, the further then restored regard probably building to being the church." (Severely garbled sentence structure)
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "inby" (likely typo, unclear intention)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly complex vocabulary in some sentences (e.g., "sultifying authority", "sultry atmosphere") may impede smooth reading for non-expert readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing Canterbury's historical significance to speculating about the future of the State Church without clear connection
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between different time periods (from Augustine's landing to modern times) without clear transitional phrases
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The final paragraph about St. Martin's church seems somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative about Canterbury's ecclesiastical importance
