2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the interfaith movement to the responsibilities of Bahá'ís without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical context, philosophical discussion, and future outlook without smooth transitions
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly dense with ideas, making it hard to discern the main point (e.g., the long paragraph discussing the 20th century's materialistic interpretation)
