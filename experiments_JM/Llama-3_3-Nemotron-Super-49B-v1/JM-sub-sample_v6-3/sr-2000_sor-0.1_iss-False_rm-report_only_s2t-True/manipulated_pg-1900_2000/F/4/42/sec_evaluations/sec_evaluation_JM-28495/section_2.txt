Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "For the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us.")
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("hotfoot", "dogless", "guideless") might not suit all audiences
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense ("coulded" instead of "could")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the chase to the conversation about going home
- [CLARITY] The character's emotional shift (Stella's frustration) could be more smoothly integrated
- [LOGIC] The narrative assumes the reader understands the context of "Dogs' Home" without clear prior explanation in this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
