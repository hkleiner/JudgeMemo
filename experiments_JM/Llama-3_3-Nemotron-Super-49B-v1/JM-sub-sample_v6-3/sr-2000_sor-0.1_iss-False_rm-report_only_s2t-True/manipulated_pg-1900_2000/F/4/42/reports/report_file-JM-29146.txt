Section section_01 (Chars 0–8029):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "ith" instead of "is" (repeated throughout)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of "th" in dialogue for lisp effect, potentially disrupting flow
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Some sentence structures are slightly convoluted (e.g., "He was a big man even by Earth standards, which meant he towered over the Irwadian's green, scaly head.")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Earthgirl's sudden appearance and her ability to read minds could be clearer in its introduction or setup
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The ease with which the planetarization's impact is accepted by characters (e.g., Englander's immediate resignation to his situation)

Section section_02 (Chars 8030–13220):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent misspelling of "th" sounds, likely intentional for character portrayal but still affects fluency)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "anthropologist friend", "be-jeweled straps") that might slow reading flow for some readers
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, winding sentences (e.g., the final paragraph before the gambling hall scene) that could be broken up for smoother flow
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from the heartwarming scene with Englander to the tense gambling hall encounter without a clear narrative bridge
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Irwadian's sudden, intense hatred for Earthmen, while contextualized by "planetarization frenzy", feels somewhat unprepared in this specific scene
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The silence in the gambling hall being "ominous and in his favor" doesn't fully align with the described lack of support (no other Earthmen)
