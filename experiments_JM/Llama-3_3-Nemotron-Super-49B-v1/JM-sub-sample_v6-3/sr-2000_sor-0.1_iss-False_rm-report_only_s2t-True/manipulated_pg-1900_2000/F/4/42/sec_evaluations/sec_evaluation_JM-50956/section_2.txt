- [GRAMMAR] "should had been" (incorrect use of "had" instead of "have")

- [LEXICON] "sanguine World struggle" (likely meant "sanitary" or more appropriately "bloody" or similar, given the context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of the significance of the Marne battle without brief contextualization within this segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Moltke plan's failure to introducing Ludendorf's memoirs without a clearer connecting thought.
- [CLARITY] The sentence structure in several paragraphs is complex and could be simplified for better flow and understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
