Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It will perhaps be said...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suppleness", "nonconformist", "encephalon" not present but "suppleness" is in context, however "strenuously" and "honoured" are in the current segment)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "were not accepted" followed by "could never be taken away")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with "the Synthetic Philosophy" and its specifics without brief contextualization within the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's later life sentiments to analyzing the breadth of his philosophical emphasis.
- [CLARITY] Overly dense and abstract concepts (e.g., "the unceasing redistribution of matter and motion") without simplification for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
