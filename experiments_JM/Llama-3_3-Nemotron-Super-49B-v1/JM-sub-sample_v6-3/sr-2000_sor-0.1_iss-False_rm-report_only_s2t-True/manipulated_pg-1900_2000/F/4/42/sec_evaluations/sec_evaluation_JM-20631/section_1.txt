Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "recondite", "esoteric") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Arthur Davis to the broader topic of Hebrew's revival without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph comparing various ritual languages, while informative, slightly distracts from the central figure of Arthur Davis before refocusing.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
