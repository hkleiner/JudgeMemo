Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "was" instead of "were" in "all doors was open"
- [GRAMMAR] "it is an American" should be "I am an American"
- [GRAMMAR] "I coulded went" should be "I could go"
- [SPELLING] "taubes" (likely should be "taubes" is correct, but if intended as "zeppelins" or another term, it's an issue; assuming correct in this context, no score deduction for this)
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs

- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the bourgeoisie to returning to the war zone
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" and its significance without introduction
