Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "they was" (subject-verb agreement error, should be "they were")
- [LEXICON] "unprepared into the city" (slightly awkward phrasing, could imply physical state rather than emotional/preparatory)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede flow for some readers (e.g., the long speculative sentence about the last pilgrim)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing modern pilgrims to diving into ancient history without a clear connector
- [CLARITY] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about specific locations (e.g., Selling, Chartham, Harbledown) without brief contextualization
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter seems to end abruptly without summarizing the transition to the next chapter's focus

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
