Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "where he live for the remainder of his life" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] "some talk without saying anything, as though they were mere politicians" (idiomatic expression could be clearer for all audiences)
- [SPELLING] None detected in the current segment, but "have" in the previous section (though not part of the evaluation, it's a near-context error) is noted for awareness; however, within the current segment: "establish" should be "established" 

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Reynolds' success to a general statement about artists
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the faults of Reynolds and the comparison to modern performers could be more clearly connected to the preceding text
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the discussion of Reynolds' friendships and the critique of his personal flaws

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
