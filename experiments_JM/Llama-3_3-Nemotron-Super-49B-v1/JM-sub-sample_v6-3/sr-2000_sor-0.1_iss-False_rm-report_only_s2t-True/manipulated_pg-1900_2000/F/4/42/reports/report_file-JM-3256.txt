    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fourpence-halfpenny", "Mæcenas") might require additional context for all readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical reflection, and literary critique without clear transitional markers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed knowledge of specific literary works and authors (e.g., Elia, Spenser, Chaucer) could alienate less familiar readers.
