Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "disporting") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's artistic approach to labeling him "more a philosopher than a painter" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about "The Sheep Pen" assumes familiarity with the canvas, potentially leaving some readers disconnected without visual context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
