Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "nail him!" (informal, yet contextually fitting, but slightly jarring)
- [LEXICON] Colloquialisms ("bet cher life", "sonny") may reduce readability for some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing quotation marks in some dialogue transitions (e.g., after "nail him!")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Bud's robbery story to asking about the burro herd
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of characters' past interactions (e.g., favors done for the humpbacked man) without context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
