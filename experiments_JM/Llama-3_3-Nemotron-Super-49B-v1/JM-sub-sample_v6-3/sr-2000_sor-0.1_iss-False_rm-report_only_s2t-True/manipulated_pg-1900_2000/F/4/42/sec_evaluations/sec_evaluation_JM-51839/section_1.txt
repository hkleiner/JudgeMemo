Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "write" should be "written" (in the phrase "Having no write language")
- [SYNTAX] "command that immediately following his death" could be rephrased for clarity ("instructed that after his death")
- [LEXICON] "manâ€™s world" might be slightly archaic or less common in modern writing, potentially affecting flow for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic verse to historical narrative without clear connector
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain historical figures/events (e.g., Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda) without brief introduction
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of the "Nacogdoches The Indian Town" chapter and the start of "First White Settlement"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
