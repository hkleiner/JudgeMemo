  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "which was to was" (redundant "to")
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "capture on May 4, 1864" (should be "captured")
        • "woulded" (should be "would")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "the story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told" (somewhat abrupt transition)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing the Army of the Potomac's actions to detailing Petersburg's strategic importance without a clear transitional sentence.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The connection between the outcome of the battles (e.g., Cold Harbor) and the strategic decision to target Petersburg could be more explicitly stated.

Section section_02 (Chars 8185–12923):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "have threatened" should be "had threatened" (subject-verb agreement in past perfect tense)
        • "work continue" should be "work continued" (verb tense consistency)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "several were built of logs lay across the road" is slightly unclear; rephrasing for clarity suggested
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing railroads to introducing the "Dimmock Line" without clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The shift from historical context to the specifics of the "Dimmock Line" and then to the battle preparations could be smoother for better flow
