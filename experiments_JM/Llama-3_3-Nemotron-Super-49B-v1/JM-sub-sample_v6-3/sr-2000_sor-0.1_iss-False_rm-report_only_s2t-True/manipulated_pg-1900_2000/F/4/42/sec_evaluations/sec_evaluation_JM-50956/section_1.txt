Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "sustain" should be "sustained" (minor, does not significantly impact readability)
- [LEXICON] Some sentence structures are overly complex, potentially hindering smooth reading for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing Russia's sacrifices and the question of Germany's potential win could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter "Russia's Part in the World War - Was it Possible for Germany to Win the War?" starts with a discussion that feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding detailed historical account without a clear linking sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
