Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "I had have on my tongueâ€™s end" (incorrect verb tense consistency)
- [LEXICON] "unmodulated person" (uncommon word choice, may cause reading pause)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing article ("at his bedroom fire" could imply a missing "the" for clarity, though this is stylistic)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from dinner table conversation to Vereker's response analysis without clear connection to the preceding paragraph's focus.
- [CLARITY] Vereker's intentions in dismissing the review as "twaddle" and then calling it "charming" could be clearer in context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
