Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "they was" (subject-verb agreement error, should be "they were")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "unprepared into the city" (slightly awkward phrasing, could imply physical state rather than emotional/preparatory)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Complex sentence structures may impede flow for some readers (e.g., the long speculative sentence about the last pilgrim)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing modern pilgrims to diving into ancient history without a clear connector
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about specific locations (e.g., Selling, Chartham, Harbledown) without brief contextualization
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The chapter seems to end abruptly without summarizing the transition to the next chapter's focus

        • Abrupt shift from historical narrative to speculative future scenarios (e.g., the potential end of the State Church).
