Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "led what" should be "led" or "who led" for grammatical correctness
- [SYNTAX] "embraced a population of several hundred souls" (somewhat archaic phrasing, though clear)
- [SPELLING] "superintended... and superintended" (redundant, could be simplified for flow)
- [SPELLING] "were place" should be "were placed"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Ybarbo's removal to stating Nacogdoches' size without a clear connector
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of the Louisiana purchase's impact on Nacogdoches without brief elaboration
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the Nolan expedition to the Louisiana purchase without a transitional sentence
