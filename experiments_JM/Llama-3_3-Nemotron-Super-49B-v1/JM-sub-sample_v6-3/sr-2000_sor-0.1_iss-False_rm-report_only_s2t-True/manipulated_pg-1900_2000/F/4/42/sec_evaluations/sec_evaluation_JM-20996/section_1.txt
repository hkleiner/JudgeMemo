Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of the robe's value)
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld", "revelry") may hinder smooth reading for some readers
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "We am alone" should be "We were alone"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the ship's departure to the detailed account of Honolulu's attractions without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps between historical events, personal experiences, and descriptive passages without clear sectioning or transitional phrases, potentially confusing the reader
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the Century Magazine reference feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate narrative context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
