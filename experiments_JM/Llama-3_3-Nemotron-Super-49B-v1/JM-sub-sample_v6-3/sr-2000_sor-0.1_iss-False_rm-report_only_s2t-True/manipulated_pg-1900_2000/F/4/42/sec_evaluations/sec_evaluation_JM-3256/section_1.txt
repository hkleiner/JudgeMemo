Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fourpence-halfpenny", "MÃ¦cenas") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical reflection, and literary critique without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of specific literary works and authors (e.g., Elia, Spenser, Chaucer) could alienate less familiar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
