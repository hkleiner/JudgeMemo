Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few instances of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "indefeasible inheritance", "irreconcilable religious antipathies") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between discussing the interfaith movement's challenges and the historical context of materialism could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it difficult for readers to discern the primary point without close attention.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
