Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "the public failed to distinguish a work which did not sufficiently distinguish itself" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "energetically stamped his productions later on" (word choice could be more precise)
- [SPELLING] "I will not said" (typo, should be "I will not say")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Meissonier's early struggles to exhibiting at 16 without clear connection
- [CLARITY] "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close" (somewhat ambiguous)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
