        • Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of the robe's value)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld", "revelry") may hinder smooth reading for some readers - [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "We am alone" should be "We were alone"
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from describing the ship's departure to the detailed account of Honolulu's attractions without a clear connecting sentence
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The narrative jumps between historical events, personal experiences, and descriptive passages without clear sectioning or transitional phrases, potentially confusing the reader
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The inclusion of the Century Magazine reference feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate narrative context
