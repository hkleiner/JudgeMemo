Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "sultifying", "sultry atmosphere") might require additional effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from historical narrative to speculative future scenarios (e.g., the potential end of the State Church).
- [CLARITY] The paragraph discussing St. Martin's church history could benefit from clearer resolution or acknowledgment of the uncertainty.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
