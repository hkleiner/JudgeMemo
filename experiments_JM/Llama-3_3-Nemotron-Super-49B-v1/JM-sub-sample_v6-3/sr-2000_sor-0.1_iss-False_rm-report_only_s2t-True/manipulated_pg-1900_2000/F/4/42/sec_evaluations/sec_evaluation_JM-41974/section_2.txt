Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "enamoured", "exaltation", "sumptuous")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., "If the models... impressed him...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's inspiration to the "CHAPTER: THE SOJOURN IN VENICE" section without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Veronese's works and historical context (e.g., specifics of his paintings, Venetian masters)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
