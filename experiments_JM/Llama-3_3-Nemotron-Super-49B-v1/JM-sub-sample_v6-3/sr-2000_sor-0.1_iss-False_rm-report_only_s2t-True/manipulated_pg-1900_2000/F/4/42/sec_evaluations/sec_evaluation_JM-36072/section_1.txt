- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "epigoni") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between historical periods and ideas could be smoother in a few instances.
- [CLARITY] Assumed historical knowledge (e.g., specific events, figures) might leave some readers needing external context.
