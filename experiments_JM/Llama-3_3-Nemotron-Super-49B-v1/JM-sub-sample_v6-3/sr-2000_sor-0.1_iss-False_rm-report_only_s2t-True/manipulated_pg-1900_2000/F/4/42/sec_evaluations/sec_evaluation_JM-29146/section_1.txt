Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated throughout)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "th" in dialogue for lisp effect, potentially disrupting flow
- [SYNTAX] Some sentence structures are slightly convoluted (e.g., "He was a big man even by Earth standards, which meant he towered over the Irwadian's green, scaly head.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts
- [CLARITY] The Earthgirl's sudden appearance and her ability to read minds could be clearer in its introduction or setup
- [LOGIC] The ease with which the planetarization's impact is accepted by characters (e.g., Englander's immediate resignation to his situation)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
