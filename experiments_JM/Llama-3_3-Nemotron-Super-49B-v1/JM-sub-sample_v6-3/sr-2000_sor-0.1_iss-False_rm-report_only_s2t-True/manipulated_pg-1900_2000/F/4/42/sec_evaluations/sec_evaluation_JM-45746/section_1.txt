Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded" (incorrect verb form, should be "should")
- [SYNTAX] Overly long sentences (e.g., first paragraph of "GETTING A POSITION")
- [LEXICON] Archaic language (e.g., "am entertained", "state agricultural school" without context for modern readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between "ENTERING THE TEACHING PROFESSION" and "GETTING A POSITION" chapters without a clear link
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge (e.g., "Department of Superintence" without explanation)
- [LOGIC] Contrast between the two young men could be more explicitly stated for clearer comparison

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
