  Fluency Issues:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumption about modern readers' understanding of peasant life without clear connection to Millet's work
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's inspirations to analyzing "The Angelus" without a clear link
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the last paragraph before the final statement on Millet's ranking)

        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ménage", "disporting") might require additional processing for modern readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's artistic approach to labeling him "more a philosopher than a painter" without clear connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The paragraph about "The Sheep Pen" assumes familiarity with the canvas, potentially leaving some readers disconnected without visual context.
