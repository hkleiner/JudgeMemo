Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "fellah√¨n", "dusky fellows") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the discovery of tablets and shifting focus to the Egyptian Court in Chapter II without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures and events (e.g., Thutmosis III's campaigns) without brief elaboration.
