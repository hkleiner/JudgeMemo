Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It is your first day...") may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "lace shoes", "picklelime") might require brief pauses for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different ages and locations without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the protagonist's thoughts and feelings (e.g., liking a girl with "cute pigtails") are made without explicit setup.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
