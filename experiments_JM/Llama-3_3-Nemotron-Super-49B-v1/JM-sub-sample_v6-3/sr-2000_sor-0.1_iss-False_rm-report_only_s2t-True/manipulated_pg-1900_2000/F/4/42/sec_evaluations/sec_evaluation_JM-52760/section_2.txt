Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "have threatened" should be "had threatened" (subject-verb agreement in past perfect tense)
- [GRAMMAR] "work continue" should be "work continued" (verb tense consistency)
- [LEXICON] "several were built of logs lay across the road" is slightly unclear; rephrasing for clarity suggested

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing railroads to introducing the "Dimmock Line" without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The shift from historical context to the specifics of the "Dimmock Line" and then to the battle preparations could be smoother for better flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
