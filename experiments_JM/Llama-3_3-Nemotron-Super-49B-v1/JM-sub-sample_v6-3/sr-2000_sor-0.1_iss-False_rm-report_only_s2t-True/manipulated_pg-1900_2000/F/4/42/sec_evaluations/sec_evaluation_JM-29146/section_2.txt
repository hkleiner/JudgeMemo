Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent misspelling of "th" sounds, likely intentional for character portrayal but still affects fluency)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "anthropologist friend", "be-jeweled straps") that might slow reading flow for some readers
- [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences (e.g., the final paragraph before the gambling hall scene) that could be broken up for smoother flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the heartwarming scene with Englander to the tense gambling hall encounter without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The Irwadian's sudden, intense hatred for Earthmen, while contextualized by "planetarization frenzy", feels somewhat unprepared in this specific scene
- [LOGIC] The silence in the gambling hall being "ominous and in his favor" doesn't fully align with the described lack of support (no other Earthmen)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
