Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures in descriptive paragraphs (e.g., "Of the historic and scenic charms...") may impede smooth reading for younger readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bairn", "wee", "laddies") might require additional context or explanation for non-Scotch or younger readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the preface to "THE FINDING OF 'ROB ROY'" without a clear narrative link.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of Scotch customs and foods (e.g., shortbread, scones) without brief explanation for unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
