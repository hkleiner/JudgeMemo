Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "lend light" might confuse some readers)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between descriptive scenes and introspective moments without clear sectioning or transitions
