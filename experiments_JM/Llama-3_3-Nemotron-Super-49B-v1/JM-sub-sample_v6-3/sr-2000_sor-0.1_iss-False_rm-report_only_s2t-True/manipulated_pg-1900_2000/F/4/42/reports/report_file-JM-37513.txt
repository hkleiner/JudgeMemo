  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "aromacular", "quasi-biological", "sinewy suppleness") might challenge modern readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical explanation, and biographical critique without clear transitional markers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with Spencer's works and 19th-century scientific context.

Section section_02 (Chars 9138–12778):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It will perhaps be said...")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suppleness", "nonconformist", "encephalon" not present but "suppleness" is in context, however "strenuously" and "honoured" are in the current segment)
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "were not accepted" followed by "could never be taken away")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumption that readers are familiar with "the Synthetic Philosophy" and its specifics without brief contextualization within the segment.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's later life sentiments to analyzing the breadth of his philosophical emphasis.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Overly dense and abstract concepts (e.g., "the unceasing redistribution of matter and motion") without simplification for clarity.
