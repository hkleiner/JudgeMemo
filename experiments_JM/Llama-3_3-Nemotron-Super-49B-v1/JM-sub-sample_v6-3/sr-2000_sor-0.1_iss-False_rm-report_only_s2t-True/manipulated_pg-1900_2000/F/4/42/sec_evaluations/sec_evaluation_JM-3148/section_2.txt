Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If any one have ever given him a task...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "congress" shoe, "duckling hatched from a henâ€™s egg") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing childhood antics to philosophical questioning without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "put me into vital relation with life and law" could be clearer in its intent within the context of the questions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
