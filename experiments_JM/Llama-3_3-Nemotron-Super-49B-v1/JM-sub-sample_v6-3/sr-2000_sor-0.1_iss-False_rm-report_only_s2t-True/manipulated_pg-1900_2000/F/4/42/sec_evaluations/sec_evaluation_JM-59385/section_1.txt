Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "lend light" might confuse some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition)
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive scenes and introspective moments without clear sectioning or transitions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
