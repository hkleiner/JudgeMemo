Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin" (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "betwixted" (should be "between")
- [SYNTAX] "Millet can was considered" (redundant "can")
- [LEXICON] "unremited" (should be "unremitting")
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded" (should be "could")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about modern readers' understanding of peasant life without clear connection to Millet's work
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's inspirations to analyzing "The Angelus" without a clear link
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the last paragraph before the final statement on Millet's ranking)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
