- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in some sentences)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift in topic (Bábí victims paragraph seems out of place)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., from Corvick's departure to the protagonist's night with Vereker)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, reducing clarity
