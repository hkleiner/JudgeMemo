Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "For the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "venomous snap", "moltke", "double-florins")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past simple and past continuous without clear narrative need)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the chase scene to the narrative about Lemoyne's studio and "PÃ¨re Cars" without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The character's sudden realization and comment about the Dogs' Home's direction lacks setup or hint, causing slight confusion
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the intense chase to the calm, reflective dialogue at the end feels somewhat disjointed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
