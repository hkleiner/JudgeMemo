Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "How vividly Debby remembered clinging to the poor mother and sobbing out the promise to stay with father."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in dialogue (e.g., "Dost hear?", "Wilt thou obey?") may feel inconsistent with modern narrative expectations.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Strong, energetic Debby chafed under enforced idleness."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion (Tocqueville, Bahá’í Faith) to Debby's story without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Unclear timeline and context for historical references (e.g., battles, King George) without prior setup in the provided segment.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from Debby's reflection to historical musings) disrupt flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
