Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "teutons", "strenuous campaign").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from discussing Russia's war efforts to philosophical musings on human unity (mid-text) disrupts coherence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between specific war statistics and broader strategic analyses without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
