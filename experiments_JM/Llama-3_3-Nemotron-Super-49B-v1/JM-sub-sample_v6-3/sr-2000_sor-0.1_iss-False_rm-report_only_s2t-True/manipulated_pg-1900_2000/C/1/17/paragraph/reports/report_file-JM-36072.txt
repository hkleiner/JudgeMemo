  Fluency Issues:

        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between broad historical analysis and specific, detailed anecdotes without clear transitional phrases.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed background knowledge (e.g., historical events, figures) could leave some readers disconnected from the narrative flow.

  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from Persia to 18th-century Europe)
