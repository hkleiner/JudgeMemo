Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., first paragraph)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern audiences (e.g., "gadding fashions", "fopperies")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in transitions between historical and biographical narrative)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Jean Honoré Fragonard's biography to discussing Bahá’u’lláh (lacks transitional connection)
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur introduction of Reynolds' biography without clear relevance to Fragonard's narrative at that point
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between chapters ("THE BEGINNINGS" to "ROME")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
