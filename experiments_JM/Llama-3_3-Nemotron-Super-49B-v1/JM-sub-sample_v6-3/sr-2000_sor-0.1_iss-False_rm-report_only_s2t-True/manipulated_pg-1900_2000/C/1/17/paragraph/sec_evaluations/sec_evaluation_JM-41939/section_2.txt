Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done, there was exchange of compliments..." (abrupt shift in context and topic)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal/stilted language in "...stilted manner of good-fellowship of the day..." (distracts from overall readability)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "...in the level stretch of the Monceau quarter..." (minor, but noticeable)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected transition to "In the years which immediately followed His departure from Persia..." (completely unrelated topic)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear chronological or thematic connection between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Rosa's studies to Persian context)
- [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of "...the gossip is not without authority and weight..." (confuses the narrative focus)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
