Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in long, convoluted sentences (e.g., "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps...").
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic language may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "sanguine World struggle", "unmoralized").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Austrian involvement in France was both necessary and feasible without clear justification.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing military strategy to critiquing General Ludendorff's memoirs and then to an unrelated anecdote about Reynolds.
- [CLARITY] Overly broad statements without sufficient supporting evidence (e.g., "the true historic role of Russia in the War").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
