Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from Persia to 18th-century Europe)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-experts (e.g., "millennialist", "Chauvinism", "Jingoism")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the children of the new age to surpass the most erudite of nineteenth-century scholars" (could imply all children, not just some)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between the first paragraph (Persia/BÃ¡b) and the rest of the segment
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts in topic (e.g., from religious movement to 18th-century international relations to social conditions)
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers will infer the relevance of historical examples to the broader argument without explicit connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
