Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "rainless", "Musselman", "Quay of the Slaves") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's artistic style to a paragraph about political corruption and then to Reynolds (seems out of place and unrelated to Veronese's biography).
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of the historical context and figures (e.g., George III, Reynolds, Goldsmith) without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
