Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "epigoni") might require additional effort for less knowledgeable readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between broad historical analysis and specific, detailed anecdotes without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge (e.g., historical events, figures) could leave some readers disconnected from the narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
