Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "broadly considered", "superoorganic") could hinder readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the concluding quote without clear transitional context.
- [CLARITY] The final sentence "let us, therefore, make the best of it and rejoice" feels disconnected from the preceding philosophical discussion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
