Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between sentences in different paragraphs (e.g., from Boucher's art to literary critique to historical events)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "virility" in art context, "contemporaneous of all the ages")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "whether his stay were short or not" (should be "was" for subject-verb agreement)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected shift from discussing Boucher to analyzing a literary work and then to the French Revolution and its aftermath
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear connection between the French Revolution's impact and the preceding discussion on art and literature
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through topic changes

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
