Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "ebullition", "naïveté") might slow comprehension for non-advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing 19th-century scientists to introducing Bahá’u’lláh’s writings without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] The section seems to tackle two distinct topics (decline of Christmas spirit and Bahá’u’lláh’s writings) without a strong cohesive link.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
