Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical contexts (e.g., from Petersburg's railroads to Jeanne Antoinette Poisson's birth)
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent tone (shifts between formal historical narrative and biographical anecdote)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issue (e.g., missing Oxford comma in lists, though not prevalent)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of unrelated historical figure (Jeanne Antoinette Poisson) and artist discussions (Ludovico Caracci, etc.)
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear connection between the first part (Petersburg's significance) and the later, unrelated biographical segments
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to connect disparate topics

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
