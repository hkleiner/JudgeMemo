Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "rudy of complexion") might slow comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic principles to introducing Eug√®ne Delacroix without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., from Meissonier's childhood to a commentary on English art) without strong transitional links.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
