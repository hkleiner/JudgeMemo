Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between philosophical reflection and personal anecdote (e.g., shift from Von Eicken's theory to "As I am more susceptible to manners...")
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary for general readability (e.g., "provoked violent reactions", "salutary cold douche")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issue with quotation integration (e.g., "...says Sybel, has always heralded...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (war experiences, philosophical musings, travel observations)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between distinct thematic sections
- [LOGIC] Tangential inclusion of Von Eicken's historical examples without clear relevance to the surrounding narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
