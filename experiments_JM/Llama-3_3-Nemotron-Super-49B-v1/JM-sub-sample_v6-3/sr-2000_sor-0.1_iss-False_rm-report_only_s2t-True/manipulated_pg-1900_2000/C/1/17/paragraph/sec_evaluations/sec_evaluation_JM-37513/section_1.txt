Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "encephalon" not present but similar tone) might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between discussing Spencer's philosophy and unrelated historical/biographical snippets (e.g., Bahá’u’lláh, Boucher, Louis XV).
- [CLARITY] Overly broad topics covered without clear connections to a central thesis or argument within the segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
