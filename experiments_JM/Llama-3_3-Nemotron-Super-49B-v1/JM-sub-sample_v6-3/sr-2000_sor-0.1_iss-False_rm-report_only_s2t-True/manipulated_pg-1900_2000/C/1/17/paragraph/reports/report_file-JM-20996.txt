Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "We are always sowing our future; we are always reaping our past.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "luckless", "sceptre", "Kanakas") might require additional effort for modern readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing the Industrial Revolution and French monarchy to the United States Government's action without clear contextual link
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from the ship's departure to a detailed description of Honolulu attractions without a smooth connection)

Section section_02 (Chars 8984–13716):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 2.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Abrupt transition between descriptions of Filipino attire and the discussion of art (Reynolds, Italy)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Sudden shift in vocabulary tone (from descriptive ethnography to art critique)
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor: "the surplus part knotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped around the body" (slightly unclear)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Unconnected sub-sections (Filipino women's attire, Art discussion, Manila's history, Bridge scene, Art history again, Back to Manila life)
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between vastly different topics
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Inclusion of unrelated art historical analysis disrupts the narrative's geographical and cultural focus
