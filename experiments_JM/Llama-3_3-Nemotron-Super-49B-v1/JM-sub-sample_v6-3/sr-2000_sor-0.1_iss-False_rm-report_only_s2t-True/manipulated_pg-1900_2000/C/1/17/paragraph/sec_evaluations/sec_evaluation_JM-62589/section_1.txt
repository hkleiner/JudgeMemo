Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between the narrative of Debby and the unrelated paragraph about Reynolds.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language ("lass", "thou art", etc.) may hinder readability for some modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had been ordered" to "was to go").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected insertion of the Reynolds and historical philosophy paragraphs disrupts narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between Debby's story and the philosophical/historical asides.
- [LOGIC] The narrative's emotional impact is diluted by the non-sequitur paragraphs.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
