Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly elaborate vocabulary (e.g., "enraptured eye", "spangled ornaments") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Caliari's impressions of Venice to discussing the early 19th century's messianic expectations without clear connection.
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the early 19th century and religious movements seems unrelated to the rest of the section focusing on Caliari and Venice.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
