  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional cognitive effort for less advanced readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing the aristocracy to the personal narrative about buying a dog.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The narrative's meandering nature, while engaging, occasionally delays the progression towards the main goal (reaching the Home for Lost Dogs).

Section section_02 (Chars 8407–13919):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "For the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "venomous snap", "moltke", "double-florins")
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past simple and past continuous without clear narrative need)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from the chase scene to the narrative about Lemoyne's studio and "Père Cars" without clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The character's sudden realization and comment about the Dogs' Home's direction lacks setup or hint, causing slight confusion
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the intense chase to the calm, reflective dialogue at the end feels somewhat disjointed
