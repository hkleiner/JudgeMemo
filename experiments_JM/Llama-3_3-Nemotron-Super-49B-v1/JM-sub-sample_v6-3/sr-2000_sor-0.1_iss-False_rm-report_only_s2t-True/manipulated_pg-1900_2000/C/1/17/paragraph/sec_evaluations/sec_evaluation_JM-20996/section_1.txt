Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "We are always sowing our future; we are always reaping our past.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "luckless", "sceptre", "Kanakas") might require additional effort for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Industrial Revolution and French monarchy to the United States Government's action without clear contextual link
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from the ship's departure to a detailed description of Honolulu attractions without a smooth connection)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
