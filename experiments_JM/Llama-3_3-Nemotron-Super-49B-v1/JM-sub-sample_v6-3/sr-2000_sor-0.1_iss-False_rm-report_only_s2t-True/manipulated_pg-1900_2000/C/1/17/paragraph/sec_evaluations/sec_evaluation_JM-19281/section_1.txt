Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from discussing religious unity to describing pre-Industrial Revolution society)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist audiences (e.g., "desolating affliction", "agonizing disjunction")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential topic shift (historical context appears out of place within the religious discourse)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially obscuring their meaning
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between distinct ideas (e.g., moving from the response to the letter to discussing humanity's spiritual evolution)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
