Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some sentences (e.g., "He was a big man... He towered" and later "Ramsey went... He did not look back")
- [SPELLING] Intentional lisp in dialogue may confuse some readers (e.g., "ith", "thith")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common terms (e.g., "double-florins", "livres") might require additional context for full understanding

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Ramsey's conversation and the historical/political commentary (e.g., "No doubt, political corruption...") without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Sudden introduction of unrelated characters and settings (e.g., Boucher, Lemoyne's studio, Bahá’u’lláh’s writings) disrupts narrative flow
- [LOGIC] Time and setting inconsistencies (e.g., moving from spaceport to historical figures without transition)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
