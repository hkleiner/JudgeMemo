Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical and artistic discussions (e.g., shift from Thomas Becket to Boucher's art style)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-specialists (e.g., "contumacy", "moulding of his technique")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and thematic jumps (e.g., historical event, artistic style, philosophical quote, prehistoric Canterbury)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between paragraphs (e.g., from Reynolds to Von Eicken to Canterbury's history)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge in multiple domains (art, history, philosophy) without introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
