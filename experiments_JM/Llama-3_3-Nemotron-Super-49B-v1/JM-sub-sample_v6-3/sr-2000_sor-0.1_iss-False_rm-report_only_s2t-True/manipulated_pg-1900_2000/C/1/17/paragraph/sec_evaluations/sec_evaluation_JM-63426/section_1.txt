Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It seems in truth to have been very bad.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for all audiences (e.g., "pauperising", "gaiety")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Bradley's impact to a detailed historical socioeconomic context (mid-section)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Morris, Beardsley, Disraeli) without brief context for potentially uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
