Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "lend light" might confuse some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to the memory of the mission school (no clear connector)
- [CLARITY] The last two paragraphs seem unrelated to the rest of the segment, disrupting the narrative flow (especially the paragraph starting with "No uncertainty surrounds...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
