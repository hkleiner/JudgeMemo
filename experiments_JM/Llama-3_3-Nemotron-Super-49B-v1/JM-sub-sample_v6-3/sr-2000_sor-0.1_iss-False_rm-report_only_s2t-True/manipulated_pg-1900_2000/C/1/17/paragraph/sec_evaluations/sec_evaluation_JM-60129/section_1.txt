Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thickly bestrewn", "eternal palao") might challenge general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the village and its people to discussing historical and philosophical contexts (e.g., the Industrial Revolution, Bahá’u’lláh).
- [CLARITY] The inclusion of unrelated biographical snippet (Lemoyne's studio) disrupts the narrative's coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
