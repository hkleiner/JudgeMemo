Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Not only in his great paintings... but in his drawings and etchings" (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "m√©nage", "opalescent hues")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "it is doubtful whether riches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any increased happiness" (could use "would have brought" consistently)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Reynolds to analyzing Millet's work without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the artists (e.g., Reynolds, Millet, Diaz) without brief introduction/context
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between paragraphs, especially from the biographical sketch to the art analysis

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
