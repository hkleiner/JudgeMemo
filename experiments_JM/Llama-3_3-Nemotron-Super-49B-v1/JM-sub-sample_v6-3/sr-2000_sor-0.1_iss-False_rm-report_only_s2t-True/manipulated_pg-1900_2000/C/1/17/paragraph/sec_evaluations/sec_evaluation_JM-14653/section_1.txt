Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "What I mean to insinuate...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst" and "thou" implied in style)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Christmas to detailing historical/economic events (mid-Chapter One) 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from Christmas feelings to artist influences without clear connection)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
