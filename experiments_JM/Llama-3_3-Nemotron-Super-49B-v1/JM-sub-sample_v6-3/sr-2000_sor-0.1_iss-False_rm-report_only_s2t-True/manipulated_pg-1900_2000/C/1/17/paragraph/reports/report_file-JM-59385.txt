Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "lend light" might confuse some readers)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to the memory of the mission school (no clear connector)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The last two paragraphs seem unrelated to the rest of the segment, disrupting the narrative flow (especially the paragraph starting with "No uncertainty surrounds...")

Section section_02 (Chars 8696–12211):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 2.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Abrupt transition between Kuei Ping's story and the introduction of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly formal vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "squandered your valuable time", "bowed out").

    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden, unconnected introduction of a new character (Jeanne Antoinette Poisson) without clear relevance to the preceding narrative.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of transitional elements to connect the two distinct storylines.
