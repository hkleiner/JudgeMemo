Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "squandered your valuable time", "bowed out").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of a new character (Jeanne Antoinette Poisson) without clear relevance to the preceding narrative.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional elements to connect the two distinct storylines.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
