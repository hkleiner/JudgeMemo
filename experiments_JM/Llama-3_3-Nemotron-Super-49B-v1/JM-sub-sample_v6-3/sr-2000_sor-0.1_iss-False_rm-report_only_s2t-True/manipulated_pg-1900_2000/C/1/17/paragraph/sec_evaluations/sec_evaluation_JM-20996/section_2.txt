Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between descriptions of Filipino attire and the discussion of art (Reynolds, Italy)
- [LEXICON] Sudden shift in vocabulary tone (from descriptive ethnography to art critique)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the surplus part knotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped around the body" (slightly unclear)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Unconnected sub-sections (Filipino women's attire, Art discussion, Manila's history, Bridge scene, Art history again, Back to Manila life)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between vastly different topics
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of unrelated art historical analysis disrupts the narrative's geographical and cultural focus

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
