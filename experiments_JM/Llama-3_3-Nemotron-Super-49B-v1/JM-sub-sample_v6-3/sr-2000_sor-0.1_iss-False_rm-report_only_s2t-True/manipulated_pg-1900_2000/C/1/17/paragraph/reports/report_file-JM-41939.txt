Issues:
  Fluency Issues:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly formal/stilted language in "...stilted manner of good-fellowship of the day..." (distracts from overall readability)

        • Missing article in "...in the level stretch of the Monceau quarter..." (minor, but noticeable)

        • Sudden, unconnected transition to "In the years which immediately followed His departure from Persia..." (completely unrelated topic)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Lack of clear chronological or thematic connection between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Rosa's studies to Persian context)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear relevance of "...the gossip is not without authority and weight..." (confuses the narrative focus)
