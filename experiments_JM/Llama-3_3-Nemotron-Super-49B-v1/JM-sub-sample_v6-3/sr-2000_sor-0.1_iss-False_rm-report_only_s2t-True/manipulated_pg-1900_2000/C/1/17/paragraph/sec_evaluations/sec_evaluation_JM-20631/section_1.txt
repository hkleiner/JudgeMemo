Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "recondite", "esoteric") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Arthur Davis's life to the topic of ritual languages without a clear connecting sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical narrative, historical examples, and philosophical discussions without a strongly cohesive thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
