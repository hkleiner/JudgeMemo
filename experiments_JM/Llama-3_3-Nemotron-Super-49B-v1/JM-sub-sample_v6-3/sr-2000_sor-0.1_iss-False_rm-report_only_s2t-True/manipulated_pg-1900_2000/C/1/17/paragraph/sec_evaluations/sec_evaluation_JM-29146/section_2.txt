Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent but incorrect usage for Irwadian speech pattern, assuming it's intentional for character portrayal, but may still cause reading difficulty)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "anthropologist friend", "planetarization") may hinder smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's positive feelings after helping Englander to his gambling loss and subsequent conflict (could benefit from a smoother connection)
- [CLARITY] The Irwadian's sudden, intense hatred for Earthmen, while contextualized, feels somewhat unprepared within this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
