Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "A teacher, however, should never cease to utilize every opportunity of broadening his general education." (wordy)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede readability for some audiences (e.g., "broadening his viewpoint", "associating his special subject")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "after his return he opened a studio in St. Martin's Street" (minor, but noticeable)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from educational advice to the biography of Reynolds without clear connection
- [LOGIC] The story about Reynolds and the following anecdote about the teacher seem unrelated to the preceding educational guidance, disrupting coherence
- [CLARITY] The purpose of including the Reynolds story is unclear in the context of the chapterâ€™s focus on getting a teaching position

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
