Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It is the recognition of these facts that should prompt every impartial historian...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sanguine", "auto-tuner" seems out of context and may be a typo/error)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of specific historical events (e.g., the significance of the first battle of the Marne without brief context)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing historical strategy to criticizing Ludendorff's memoirs without a clear connecting sentence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
