Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling added no little to the discomfort of the situation."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "disagreeableness", "undisturbed quiet").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Manila's history to "The droneâ€™s camera swiveled silently" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The notice at the end feels disconnected from the preceding descriptive narrative without a clear lead-in.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
