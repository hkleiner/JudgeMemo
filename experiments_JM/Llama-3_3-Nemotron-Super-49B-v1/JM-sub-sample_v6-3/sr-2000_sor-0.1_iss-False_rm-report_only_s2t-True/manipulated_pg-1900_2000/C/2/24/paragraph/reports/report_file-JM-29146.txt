Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, though stylistic, may slightly impede reading flow for some)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some dialogue (e.g., "planetarithed", "ecthra-planetarieth") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for casual readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation, potentially confusing readers

Section section_02 (Chars 8146–13342):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent but incorrect usage for Irwadian speech pattern, may distract)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "anthropologist friend", "be-jeweled straps") may slow reading for some readers
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, winding sentences (e.g., the final paragraph before the gambling hall scene) can disrupt flow
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Ramsey's good deed to his gambling, slightly disconnects the narrative flow
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Irwadian's sudden, intense hatred for Earthmen, while contextual, feels somewhat unprepared within this segment
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The silent, ominous reaction of the outworlders in the gambling hall, given their outnumbering presence, feels slightly unrealistic without further context
