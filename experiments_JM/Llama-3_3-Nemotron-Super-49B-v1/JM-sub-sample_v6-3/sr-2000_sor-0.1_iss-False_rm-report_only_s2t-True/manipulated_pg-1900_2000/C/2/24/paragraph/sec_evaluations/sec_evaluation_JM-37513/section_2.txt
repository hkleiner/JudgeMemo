Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suppleness", "sinewy", "nonconformist") might require additional cognitive effort for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing Spencer's contributions, potential criticisms of the emphasis on his philosophy, and then delving into the specifics of his philosophical beliefs, which might slightly disrupt the flow for some readers.
- [CLARITY] The dense, philosophical nature of the content, especially towards the end, could make it challenging for non-experts to fully grasp the connections between ideas without prior knowledge.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
