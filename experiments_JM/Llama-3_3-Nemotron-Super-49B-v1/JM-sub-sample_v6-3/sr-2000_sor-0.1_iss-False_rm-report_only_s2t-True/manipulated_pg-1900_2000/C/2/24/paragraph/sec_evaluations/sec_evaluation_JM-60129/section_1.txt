Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ol" instead of "of" (in "the outlines ol which")
- [LEXICON] "beatiful" instead of "beautiful" (in "a beatiful text-hand")
- [SYNTAX] Minor: "Some of them were said to have been brought from the north and were probably of Mongolian origin." (could be rephrased for smoother flow, though understandable)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the village to introducing the legend of Shiche-Hache (could benefit from a transitional sentence)
- [CLARITY] "Some of the tribe had settled in the mountains S and SE of Hsuchow, the remainder on the plain." (briefly clarifying what "the plain" refers to would enhance clarity)
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of "A bluetooth signal was detected." and "A diagnostic tool scanned the network." seems out of context and disrupts the narrative's historical coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
