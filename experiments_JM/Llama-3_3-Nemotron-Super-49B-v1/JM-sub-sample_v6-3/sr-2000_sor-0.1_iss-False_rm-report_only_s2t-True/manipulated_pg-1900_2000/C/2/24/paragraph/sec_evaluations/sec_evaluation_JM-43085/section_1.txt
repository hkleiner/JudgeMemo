Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "phalanx") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to his birth and early life could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about the phone ringing seems out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
