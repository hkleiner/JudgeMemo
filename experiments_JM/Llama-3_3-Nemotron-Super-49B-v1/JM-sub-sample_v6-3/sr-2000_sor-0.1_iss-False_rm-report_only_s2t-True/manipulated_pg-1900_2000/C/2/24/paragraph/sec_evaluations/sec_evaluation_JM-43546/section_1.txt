Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures in descriptive paragraphs (e.g., "Of the historic and scenic charms...") may slow reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "bairn", "wee") might require pause for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Scottish charms to introducing "Rob Roy" story.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Scottish culture and terms (e.g., "the four which the Scotch usually eat") without explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
