Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasnâ€™t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?") may slightly impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between past and present reflections without clear transitional markers (e.g., the shift from discussing the review to the visit at Bridges).
- [CLARITY] A few instances where the protagonist's thoughts or intentions are not immediately clear (e.g., the exact motivation behind wanting Vereker to read the review).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
