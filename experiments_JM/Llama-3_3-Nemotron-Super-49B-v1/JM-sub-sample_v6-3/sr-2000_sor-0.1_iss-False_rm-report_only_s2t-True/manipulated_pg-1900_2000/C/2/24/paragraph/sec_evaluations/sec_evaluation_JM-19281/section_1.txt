Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few instances of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustibly", "indiscriminately") might slightly hinder accessibility for non-native English speakers or those unfamiliar with formal religious texts.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The abrupt transition between discussing the global spiritual crisis and the sentence about "The home assistant played ambient music" (and similarly with "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb") disrupts the narrative flow, appearing unrelated to the surrounding content.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it challenging for readers to discern the primary point without close attention.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
