Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • A few instances of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustibly", "indiscriminately") might slightly hinder accessibility for non-native English speakers or those unfamiliar with formal religious texts.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The abrupt transition between discussing the global spiritual crisis and the sentence about "The home assistant played ambient music" (and similarly with "The autonomous vehicle waited at the curb") disrupts the narrative flow, appearing unrelated to the surrounding content.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it challenging for readers to discern the primary point without close attention.

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustible", "irreconcilable", "antipathies") might challenge less advanced readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing religious revival to introducing the Bahá'í perspective without clear connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The analogy of Majnún and Laylí, while poetic, may not immediately clarify the point for all readers without prior context.
