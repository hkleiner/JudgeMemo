Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "betwixt", "thou") might hinder modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Brueghel's influence to Millet's personal life without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about modern critiques of Millet's sentimentality feels somewhat tangential to the main narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
