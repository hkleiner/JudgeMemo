Section section_01 (Chars 0–8256):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional cognitive effort for less literate readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase discussions, and the quest for the Lost Dogs' Home, which, while mostly coherent, could benefit from smoother transitions.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The abrupt appearance of "A wireless charger powered up" disrupts coherence and seems unrelated to the surrounding context.

Section section_02 (Chars 8257–12710):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Slightly abrupt transition between sentences in chase sequences (e.g., "He turned down to the right," to "The lust of the chase...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasional overly formal vocabulary may slightly hinder flow for some readers (e.g., "moltke," "venomous snap").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumption that the man's destination is the Dogs' Home is never validated, leading to a somewhat predictable yet slightly unfulfilling conclusion.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The chapter ends somewhat abruptly without fully resolving the dog pursuit's emotional impact or providing a clear narrative bridge to the next chapter's context (advertising for a dog).
