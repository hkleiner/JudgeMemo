  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, poetic language may impede smooth reading flow (e.g., "the dint of hoof, the print of booted heel, / Like prick of spurs—the shadows that they cast.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "spilled wine and scattered musk") might require additional interpretation for general readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from poetic verse to historical narrative without clear connective tissue.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed prior knowledge of some historical figures/events (e.g., Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda, De Soto’s quest) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.
