Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "A signal booster amplified the stream." (lacks contextual integration)
- [LEXICON] Use of "nanobots" feels anachronistic and disrupts historical context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Hebrew's revival to introducing "nanobots"
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in topic from Arthur Davis's legacy to broader religious language practices without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder immediate understanding for non-specialist readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
