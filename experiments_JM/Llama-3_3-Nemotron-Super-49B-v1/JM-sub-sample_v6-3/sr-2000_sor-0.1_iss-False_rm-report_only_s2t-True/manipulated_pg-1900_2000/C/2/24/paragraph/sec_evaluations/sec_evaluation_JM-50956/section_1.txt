Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph discussing the role of Russia in saving Italy and facilitating Allied operations)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ambient light changed hue", "strenuous campaign", "belligerents") may hinder smooth reading for modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect in some descriptions of events)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced historical events and figures without brief contextualization (e.g., Moltke's plan, the significance of the Brusilov offensive)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Russia's sacrifices to introducing the question of whether Germany could have won the war
- [CLARITY] Overly broad statements (e.g., "Russia's role must be gauged...") without immediate, clear elaboration

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
