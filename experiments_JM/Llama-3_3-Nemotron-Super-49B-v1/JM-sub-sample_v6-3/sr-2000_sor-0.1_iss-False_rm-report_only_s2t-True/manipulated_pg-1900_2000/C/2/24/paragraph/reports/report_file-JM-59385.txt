Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Abrupt sentence structure in transitions (e.g., "A biosensor activated with a pulse.")
        • Long, complex sentences may impede flow for some readers
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Inconsistent tone with modern/scientific terms (e.g., "A biosensor activated with a pulse.")
    - [SPELLING]:
        • None detected
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor, e.g., "Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet" (could imply "sat quietly")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden, unannounced shift to "the little mission school" without clear connection
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Non-linear narrative jump ("It was graduation day.") without preparation
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed knowledge of cultural context (e.g., significance of dowry jewels) without explanation
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The narrative's flow is mostly logical, but the ending feels abrupt and disconnected

Section section_02 (Chars 8455–12108):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "For at the spring holidays...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some word choices feel slightly formal or less common in contemporary writing (e.g., "conned over", "stilled her lips").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from the memory of the school to the present with Madame Yen (could benefit from a smoother transition).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The conflict's emotional depth and Kuei Ping's decision-making process, while implied, could be more explicitly connected for enhanced coherence.
