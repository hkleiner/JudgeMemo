Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "unmodulated", "stupefaction") might require a brief pause for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dinner table conversation to the analysis of Vereker's reaction could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The character motivations (e.g., the narrator's expectation vs. Lady Jane's response) could be slightly more explicitly connected to enhance clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
