Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustible", "irreconcilable", "antipathies") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing religious revival to introducing the Bahá'í perspective without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The analogy of Majnún and Laylí, while poetic, may not immediately clarify the point for all readers without prior context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
