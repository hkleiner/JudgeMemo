Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sinewy English style", "immortality of necessity")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional long, winding sentences require close attention (e.g., the sentence comparing classic books to cathedrals)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing "Mark Rutherford" to introducing Mr. Augustine Birrell and then to the role of the critic
- [CLARITY] The phrase "de gustibus . . . !" feels out of place and disrupts the flow without clear connection or explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
