- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from historical narrative to descriptive tourism information (e.g., Pali, Bishop Museum) without clear connection.
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of the QR code and timestamp seems anachronistic and disrupts the historical context.
