Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ménage", "disporting") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's artistic approach to the statement "Millet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "The drone’s camera swiveled silently" seems out of place and unrelated to the surrounding context, disrupting coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
