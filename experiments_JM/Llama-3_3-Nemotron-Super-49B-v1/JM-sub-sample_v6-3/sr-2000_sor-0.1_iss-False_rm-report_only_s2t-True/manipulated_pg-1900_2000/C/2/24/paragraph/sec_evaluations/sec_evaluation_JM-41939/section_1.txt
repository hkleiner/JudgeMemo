Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "bespattered", "irksome task") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Rosa's childhood activities to the introduction of "The hologram flickered to life" and "A smart bulb changed color" without clear contextual relevance or explanation.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of historical events (e.g., the 1830 revolution, Saint-Simonism) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
