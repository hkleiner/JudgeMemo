Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some specialized terms (e.g., "k'ang", "tshokh", "Chin, ch'ih") could benefit from brief explanations for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between describing household items, clothing, and economic activities without a clear transitional flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of certain cultural or geographical specifics (e.g., "Sarö Yögur", "Khirgis") might cause confusion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
