Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association"
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may impede smooth reading for some audiences (e.g., "sultifying authority", "sultry atmosphere")
- [PUNCTUATION] Lack of clarity in long sentences (e.g., the final paragraph before St. Martin's discussion)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Canterbury's Christian history to speculating about the future of the State Church
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological jump in discussing St. Martin's church history without clear connection to preceding paragraphs
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the resolution regarding St. Martin's church origins (could be clarified with a transitional sentence)

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
