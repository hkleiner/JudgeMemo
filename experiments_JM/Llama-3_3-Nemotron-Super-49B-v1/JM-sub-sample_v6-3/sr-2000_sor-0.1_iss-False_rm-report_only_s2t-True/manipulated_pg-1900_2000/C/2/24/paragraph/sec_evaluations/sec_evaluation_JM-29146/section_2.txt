Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent but incorrect usage for Irwadian speech pattern, may distract)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "anthropologist friend", "be-jeweled straps") may slow reading for some readers
- [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences (e.g., the final paragraph before the gambling hall scene) can disrupt flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's good deed to his gambling, slightly disconnects the narrative flow
- [CLARITY] The Irwadian's sudden, intense hatred for Earthmen, while contextual, feels somewhat unprepared within this segment
- [LOGIC] The silent, ominous reaction of the outworlders in the gambling hall, given their outnumbering presence, feels slightly unrealistic without further context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
