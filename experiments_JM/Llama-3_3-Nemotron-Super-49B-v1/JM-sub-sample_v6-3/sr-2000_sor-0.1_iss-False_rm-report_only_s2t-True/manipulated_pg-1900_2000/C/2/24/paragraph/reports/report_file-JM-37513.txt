  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "aromacular", "quasi-biological", "sinewy suppleness") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical explanation, and academic critique without clear transitional markers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with Spencer's works and 19th-century scientific context may lead to confusion.

Section section_02 (Chars 8947–12876):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suppleness", "sinewy", "nonconformist") might require additional cognitive effort for less familiar readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between discussing Spencer's contributions, potential criticisms of the emphasis on his philosophy, and then delving into the specifics of his philosophical beliefs, which might slightly disrupt the flow for some readers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The dense, philosophical nature of the content, especially towards the end, could make it challenging for non-experts to fully grasp the connections between ideas without prior knowledge.
