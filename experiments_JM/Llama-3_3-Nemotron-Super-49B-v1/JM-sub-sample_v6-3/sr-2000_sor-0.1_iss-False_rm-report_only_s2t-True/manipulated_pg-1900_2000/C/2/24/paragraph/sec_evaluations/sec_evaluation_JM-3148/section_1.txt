Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, poetic descriptions may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "liebling", "degraded", "jewâ€™s-harp") might require additional context or lookup for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the descriptive, poetic narrative to the more biographical, explanatory section about Anthony Croft.
- [CLARITY] The inclusion of "A contactless payment completed." and "A smart bulb changed color." seems out of place and disrupts the narrative's coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
