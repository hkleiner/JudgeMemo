- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative of the two young men and the shift to discussing teacher failures and board evaluation criteria.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of contrasting the two young men isn't explicitly stated until the very end, potentially confusing readers.
