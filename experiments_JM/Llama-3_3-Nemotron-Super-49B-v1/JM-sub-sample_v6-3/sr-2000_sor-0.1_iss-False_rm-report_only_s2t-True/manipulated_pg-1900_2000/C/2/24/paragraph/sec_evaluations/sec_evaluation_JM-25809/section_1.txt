Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "You know you would not, and you know how you would suffer in such slavery.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms might reduce readability for all audiences (e.g., "slumgullion", "locoded")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense/perspective shifts (e.g., sudden shifts from Jim's thoughts to external dialogue without clear transitions)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Jim's emotional turmoil to the introduction of Bud (could benefit from a smoother link)
- [CLARITY] The letter's lengthy inclusion, while emotionally impactful, slightly disrupts the narrative's pacing
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of a "surveillance camera" feels out of context and unexplained

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
