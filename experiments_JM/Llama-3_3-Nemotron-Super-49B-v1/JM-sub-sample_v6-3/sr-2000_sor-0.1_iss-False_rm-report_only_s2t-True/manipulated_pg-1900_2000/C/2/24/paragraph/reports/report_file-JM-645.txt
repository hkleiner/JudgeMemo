  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?") may slightly impede smooth reading.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between past and present reflections without clear transitional markers (e.g., the shift from discussing the review to the visit at Bridges).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • A few instances where the protagonist's thoughts or intentions are not immediately clear (e.g., the exact motivation behind wanting Vereker to read the review).

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the dinner table conversation to the analysis of Vereker's reaction could be smoother.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The character motivations (e.g., the narrator's expectation vs. Lady Jane's response) could be slightly more explicitly connected to enhance clarity.
