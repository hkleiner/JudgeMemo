Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly abrupt transition between sentences in chase sequences (e.g., "He turned down to the right," to "The lust of the chase...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly formal vocabulary may slightly hinder flow for some readers (e.g., "moltke," "venomous snap").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the man's destination is the Dogs' Home is never validated, leading to a somewhat predictable yet slightly unfulfilling conclusion.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter ends somewhat abruptly without fully resolving the dog pursuit's emotional impact or providing a clear narrative bridge to the next chapter's context (advertising for a dog).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
