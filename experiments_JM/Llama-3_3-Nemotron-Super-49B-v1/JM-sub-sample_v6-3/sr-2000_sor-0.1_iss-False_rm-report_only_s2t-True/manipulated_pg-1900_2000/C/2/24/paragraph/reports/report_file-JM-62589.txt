Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "One July morning, over a hundred years ago there stood..." (awkward phrasing, consider rephrasing for clarity)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "in a very bad way indeed" (somewhat archaic or informal, depending on context)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "It mattered little to Debby whether her father was Whig or Tory, no matter what he was she hungered for him day and night." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life in Mrs. Lane's house (consider a clearer link)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The purpose of mentioning "the e-ink wallpaper changed patterns" is unclear and disrupts the historical context (assuming this is a historical fiction piece, this detail seems out of place)
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from describing Debby's daily life to recalling her mother's past feels somewhat disconnected (could benefit from a smoother transition)
