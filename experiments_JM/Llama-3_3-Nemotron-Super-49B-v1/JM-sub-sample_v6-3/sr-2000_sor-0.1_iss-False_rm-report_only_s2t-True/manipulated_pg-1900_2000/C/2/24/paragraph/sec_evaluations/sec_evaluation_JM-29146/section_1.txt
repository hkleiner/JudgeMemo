Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, though stylistic, may slightly impede reading flow for some)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some dialogue (e.g., "planetarithed", "ecthra-planetarieth") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for casual readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation, potentially confusing readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
