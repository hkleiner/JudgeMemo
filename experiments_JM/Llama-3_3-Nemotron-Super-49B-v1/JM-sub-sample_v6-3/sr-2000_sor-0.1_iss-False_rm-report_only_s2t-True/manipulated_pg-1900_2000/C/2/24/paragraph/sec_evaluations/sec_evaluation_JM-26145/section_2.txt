Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "secularisation", "heretical") might require additional context for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing religious reforms to introducing "voice-activated controls" without clear connection or context.
- [STRUCTURE] Information about officials and their roles, while relevant, feels somewhat tangential to the main narrative of religious reform.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
