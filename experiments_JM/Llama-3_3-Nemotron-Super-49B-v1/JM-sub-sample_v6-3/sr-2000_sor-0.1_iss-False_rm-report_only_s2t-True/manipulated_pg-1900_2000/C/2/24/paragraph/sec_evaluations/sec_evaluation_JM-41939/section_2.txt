Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Rumford" (assuming correct, but without context, could imply a rare or incorrect spelling in this context, though it's actually a correct reference to a historical street name)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "sustained toil", "unforeseen piece of good fortune")
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs may slightly hinder flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing art principles to introducing "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch" (seems out of place and era)
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch" is unclear and disrupts the narrative's historical context
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Rosa's study habits to her father's remarriage and change of residence could be smoother

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
