Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "If the models that passed in endless procession before his eyes impressed him as magnificent opportunities...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "filagreed", "spangled", "multicoloured") might require reader effort.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:

    - [CLARITY]:
        • The sentence "A GPS signal recalibrated" and "The AI core recalibrated the system" are jarring, non-sequiturs that disrupt coherence.
