Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • A few archaic expressions (e.g., "bespattered", "irksome task") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Rosa's childhood activities to the introduction of "The hologram flickered to life" and "A smart bulb changed color" without clear contextual relevance or explanation.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The text assumes prior knowledge of historical events (e.g., the 1830 revolution, Saint-Simonism) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

Section section_02 (Chars 8502–12848):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "Rumford" (assuming correct, but without context, could imply a rare or incorrect spelling in this context, though it's actually a correct reference to a historical street name)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "sustained toil", "unforeseen piece of good fortune")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs may slightly hinder flow
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing art principles to introducing "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch" (seems out of place and era)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The sentence "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch" is unclear and disrupts the narrative's historical context
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from Rosa's study habits to her father's remarriage and change of residence could be smoother
