Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between biblical quotes and modern references (e.g., "A backup drive clicked to life.")
- [LEXICON] Sudden shift in tone and language style (archaic to modern colloquialism)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford comma in some sentences)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Argument against judging the Bible outside its context feels somewhat undermined by the abrupt, unrelated technical interruption ("A backup drive clicked to life.")
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing biblical context to a personal anecdote ("an Englishwoman in a country drawing-room...") without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter starts with a clear direction but meanders through various points without a strong concluding tie-back

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
