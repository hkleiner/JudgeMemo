Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in transitions (e.g., "Howeverâ€”to return to the war zone.")
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "proscribed region", "territorial significance")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "I have spent" to "I did not even consider")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., insertion of "The home assistant played ambient music." and "A speech recognition unit recorded everything." without clear relevance)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of French bureaucracy and historical context without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from personal narrative to descriptive scene (e.g., transition to describing the battlefield of the Marne)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
