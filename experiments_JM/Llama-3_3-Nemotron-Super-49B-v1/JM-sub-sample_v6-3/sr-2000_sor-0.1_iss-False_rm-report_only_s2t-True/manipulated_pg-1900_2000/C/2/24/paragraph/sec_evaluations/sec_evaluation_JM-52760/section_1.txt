Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "After 36 months of bitter conflict the war in the East seemed, to many observers, to be far from a final settlement.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "stalemate", "strategically") might require additional cognitive effort for non-expert readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the broader war strategy to focusing on Petersburg's specifics without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The phrase "a drone dropped a package nearby" is entirely out of context and disrupts coherence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
