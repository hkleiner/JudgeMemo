Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "If the models that passed in endless procession before his eyes impressed him as magnificent opportunities...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "filagreed", "spangled", "multicoloured") might require reader effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Veronese's impressions of Venice to discussing his artistic style and influences without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "A GPS signal recalibrated" and "The AI core recalibrated the system" are jarring, non-sequiturs that disrupt coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
