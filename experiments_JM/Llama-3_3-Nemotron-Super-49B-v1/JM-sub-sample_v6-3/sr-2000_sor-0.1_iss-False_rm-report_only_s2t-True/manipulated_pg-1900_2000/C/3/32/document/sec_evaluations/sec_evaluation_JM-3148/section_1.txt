Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "The tenderness of his face was like that of a young mother dressing or undressing her child.")
- [LEXICON] Some overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for general audiences (e.g., "satiated with harmony", "liebling", "swan song")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from descriptive narrative to Anthony Croft's backstory without clear linking device
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the narrative's focus shift between Davy's interaction and Anthony's past

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
