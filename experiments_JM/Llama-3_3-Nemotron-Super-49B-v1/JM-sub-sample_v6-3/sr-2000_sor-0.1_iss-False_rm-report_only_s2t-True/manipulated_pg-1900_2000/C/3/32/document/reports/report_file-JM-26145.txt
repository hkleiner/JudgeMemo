Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "stuff of the thing", "district between the thing", and similar phrases indicate unclear or missing specific terms.

        • Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading (e.g., the paragraph discussing scribes' challenges).
    - [SPELLING]:
        • No apparent spelling errors, but "a thing" used repeatedly instead of a specific term is distracting.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing the tablets' discovery to the Egyptian Court's administration without a clear connecting sentence.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumptions about prior knowledge (e.g., "the stuff" invaders, "Manakhbiria") without introduction or explanation.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The narrative jumps between historical events, archaeological findings, and speculative analysis without clear transitions.
