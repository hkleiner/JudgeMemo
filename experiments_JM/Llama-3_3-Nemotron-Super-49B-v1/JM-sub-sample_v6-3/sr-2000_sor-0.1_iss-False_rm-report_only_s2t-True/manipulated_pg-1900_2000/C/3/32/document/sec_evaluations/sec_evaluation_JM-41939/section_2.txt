Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense sentence structures (e.g., "Whatever gifts he may be endowed with by nature, talent cannot be improvised; it is the fruit of independent and sustained toil.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dolman", "frogs", " Bienfaisance", "Rumford") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing artistic principles to changing residences (between paragraphs).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the thing" (likely a typo or unclear reference, e.g., "sent three paintings to the thing").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
