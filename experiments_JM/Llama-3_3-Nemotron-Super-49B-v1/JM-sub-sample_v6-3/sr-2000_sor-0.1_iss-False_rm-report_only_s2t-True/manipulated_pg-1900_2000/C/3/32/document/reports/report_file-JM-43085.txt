        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "cuirassiers", "trammelled") might require additional effort for comprehension.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic approach to his birth and early life could be smoother.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The anecdote's connection to the broader theme of respecting reality is clear, but subsequent paragraphs introduce multiple artists and styles without explicitly tying them back to Meissonier's unique approach until later.
