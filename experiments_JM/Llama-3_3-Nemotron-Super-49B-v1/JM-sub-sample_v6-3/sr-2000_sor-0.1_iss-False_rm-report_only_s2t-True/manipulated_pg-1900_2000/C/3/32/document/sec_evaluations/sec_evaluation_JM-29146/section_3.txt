Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He still had almost twenty-five credits left. Maybe he really would have a lucky night at the tables. Maybe ... heck, he'd been down-and-out before."
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial expressions ("thertainly", "thtink", etc.) for the Irwadian's dialogue, potentially disrupting immersion for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Ramsey told himself. But he grinned." (should be "Ramsey told himself, but he grinned" for smoother flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey's positive feelings after helping Englander to his decision to gamble without clear motivation.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the Englander's flat to the gambling scene without a clear temporal or spatial bridge.
- [CLARITY] The Irwadian's drunken state and hostility could be more clearly connected to the "planetarization bug" concept for enhanced coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
