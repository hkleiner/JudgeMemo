Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "stuff of the thing", "district between the thing", and similar phrases indicate unclear or missing specific terms.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering smooth reading (e.g., the paragraph discussing scribes' challenges).
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but "a thing" used repeatedly instead of a specific term is distracting.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the tablets' discovery to the Egyptian Court's administration without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge (e.g., "the stuff" invaders, "Manakhbiria") without introduction or explanation.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between historical events, archaeological findings, and speculative analysis without clear transitions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
