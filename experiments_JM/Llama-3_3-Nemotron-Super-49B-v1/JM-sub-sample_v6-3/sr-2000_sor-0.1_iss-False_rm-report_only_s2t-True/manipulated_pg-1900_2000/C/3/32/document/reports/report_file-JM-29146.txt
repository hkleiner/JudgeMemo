Section section_01 (Chars 0–8003):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "ith" instead of "is" (repeated throughout, e.g., "Your name ith Jathon Ramthey?")
        • "thith" instead of "this"
        • "nevertheleth" instead of "nevertheless"
        • "ecthactly" instead of "exactly"
        • "thurrender" instead of "surrender"
        • "thay" instead of "say"
        • "ecthra-planetarieth" instead of "extra-planetary"
        • "thelf-thupport" instead of "self-support"
        • "ethpect" instead of "expect"
        • "uth" instead of "us"
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumption that readers understand the implications of "planetarized" without explanation
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Sudden shift in perspective from Ramsey to Chind Ramar without clear transition
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Information about titanium's importance feels somewhat tangential and abruptly introduced

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16069):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Repetitive sentence structures in dialogue exchanges (e.g., "You mean it?" "Dead broke, Jase.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of similar adjectives for descriptive purposes (e.g., "chilling wind" appears twice) - [SPELLING/PHONETICS] Inconsistent representation of Irwadian speech (e.g., "thith", "eth", "uth" without clear pattern or introduction)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition from the Earthgirl's thoughts to Ramsey's conversation without clear connection
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Redundant information (e.g., Ramsey's financial situation mentioned in both context and current segment without added depth)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Underdeveloped character introduction (Stu Englander's background feels hastily included)

Section section_03 (Chars 16070–21965):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward sentence structure in "He still had almost twenty-five credits left. Maybe he really would have a lucky night at the tables. Maybe ... heck, he'd been down-and-out before."
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of colloquial expressions ("thertainly", "thtink", etc.) for the Irwadian's dialogue, potentially disrupting immersion for some readers.
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Missing article in "Ramsey told himself. But he grinned." (should be "Ramsey told himself, but he grinned" for smoother flow)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from Ramsey's positive feelings after helping Englander to his decision to gamble without clear motivation.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the Englander's flat to the gambling scene without a clear temporal or spatial bridge.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Irwadian's drunken state and hostility could be more clearly connected to the "planetarization bug" concept for enhanced coherence.
