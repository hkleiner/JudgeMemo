Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Having at length committed ourselves to the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as breed, sex, and age.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase discussions, and the quest for the Lost Dogs' Home, which, while connected, could be more seamlessly integrated for optimal flow
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The transition from discussing dog breeds to following the Battersea Home official could be slightly more direct for immediate understanding

Section section_02 (Chars 8242–12602):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "venomous snap", "starchy white curtains") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for all readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from the chase scene to the conversation about going home and then to advertising for a dog, lacking a clear narrative bridge.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The character's emotional shift (Stella's frustration to sudden fear at the water) feels somewhat unexplained without additional context.
