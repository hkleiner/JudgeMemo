Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "You may rest your soul in peace on one point. If I am not for you, I'm for no man...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms ("slumgullion", "durned") might require reader interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Jim's emotional turmoil to the introduction of Bud feels somewhat abrupt.
- [CLARITY] Jim's internal conflict and emotions, while mostly clear, could benefit from slightly more nuanced transitions between his thoughts and actions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
