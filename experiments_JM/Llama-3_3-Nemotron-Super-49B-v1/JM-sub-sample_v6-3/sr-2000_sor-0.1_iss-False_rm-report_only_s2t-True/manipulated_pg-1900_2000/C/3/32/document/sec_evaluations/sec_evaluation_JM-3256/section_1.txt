Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fourpence-halfpenny", "MÃ¦cenas") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between anecdotes (e.g., from the host's library to the Colonial squatter) could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The definition of a "bookman" evolves throughout; a clearer, upfront definition might enhance understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
