Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "a stuff") and less common vocabulary (e.g., "dross") might require additional processing time.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical narrative and art analysis without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 18th-century art and figures (e.g., Gainsborough, Romney) could reduce clarity for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
