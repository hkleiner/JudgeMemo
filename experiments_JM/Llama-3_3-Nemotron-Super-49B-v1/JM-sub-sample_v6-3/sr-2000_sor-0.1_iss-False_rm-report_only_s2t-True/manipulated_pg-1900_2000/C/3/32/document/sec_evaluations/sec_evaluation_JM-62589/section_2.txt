Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A thing had suffered so much in various forms during her short life" (repetitive structure)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "a thing" to refer to Debby, causing slight confusion
- [GRAMMAR] "where her father went, Debby wanted to go too" (could be rephrased for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Debby's thoughts to historical events (battles) without clear connection
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt move from Debby's room to the description of the town at evening without a smooth link
- [CLARITY] Unclear implication of "the battle of the stuff" (likely a typo or unclear reference)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
