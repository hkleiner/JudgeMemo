Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Repetitive sentence structures in dialogue exchanges (e.g., "You mean it?" "Dead broke, Jase.")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similar adjectives for descriptive purposes (e.g., "chilling wind" appears twice)
- [SPELLING/PHONETICS] Inconsistent representation of Irwadian speech (e.g., "thith", "eth", "uth" without clear pattern or introduction)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from the Earthgirl's thoughts to Ramsey's conversation without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Redundant information (e.g., Ramsey's financial situation mentioned in both context and current segment without added depth)
- [CLARITY] Underdeveloped character introduction (Stu Englander's background feels hastily included)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
