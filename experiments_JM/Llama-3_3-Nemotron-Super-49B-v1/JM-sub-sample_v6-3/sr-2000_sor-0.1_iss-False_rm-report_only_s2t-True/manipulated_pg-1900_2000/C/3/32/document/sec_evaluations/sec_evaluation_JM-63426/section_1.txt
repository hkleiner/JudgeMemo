Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It is your first day in the little mining town of Ishpeming. You are standing in the middle of the road watching children going home from school; the girls giggle, the boys laugh at the new boy in a too-big suit."
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague phrases ("the stuff") which disrupts flow
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles in several places (e.g., "a little mining town of Ishpeming" should be "a little mining town in Ishpeming")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the protagonist's daily life to the specific event of moving to Northern Michigan
- [CLARITY] Unclear timeline in the narrative, making it hard to follow the protagonist's age and events sequence
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between different scenes (e.g., from the school day to the circus day without a clear link)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
