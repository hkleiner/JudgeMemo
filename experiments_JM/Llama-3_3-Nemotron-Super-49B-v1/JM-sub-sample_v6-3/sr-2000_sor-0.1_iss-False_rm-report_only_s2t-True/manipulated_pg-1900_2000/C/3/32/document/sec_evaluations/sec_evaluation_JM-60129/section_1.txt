Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thickly bestrewn", "etappe stations") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive geography, cultural encounter, and historical/ethnographic detail without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of regional geography and ethnographic terms (e.g., "Sarö Yögurs", "Tangutans") without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
