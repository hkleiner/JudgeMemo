Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If any one had ever given him a task...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("duckling hatched from a henâ€™s egg", "congress" shoe) might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing childhood antics to philosophical questioning without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The shift in tone from descriptive storytelling to introspective questioning might slightly disconnect some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
