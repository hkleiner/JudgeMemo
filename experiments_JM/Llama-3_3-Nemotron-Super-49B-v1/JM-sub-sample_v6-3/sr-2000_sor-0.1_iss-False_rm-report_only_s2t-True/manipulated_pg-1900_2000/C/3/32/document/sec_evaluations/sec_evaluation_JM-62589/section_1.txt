Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing" (repeatedly used without clear introduction or explanation, causing confusion)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "lass", "thou", "thee")
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex (e.g., the paragraph starting with "Since her mother...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life with Mrs. Lane
- [CLARITY] The story's timeline and Debby's age progression could be clearer
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dramatic scene with her father to the reflective, quieter moments lacks a smooth bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
