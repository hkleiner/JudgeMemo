Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He wanted to enjoy it in the stuff, his own country" (likely meant "enjoy it in his own country")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing") instead of specific nouns
- [SPELLING] Potential inconsistency in "a thing, his own country" (context suggests "stuff" might be a typo/error)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the puppy's naming to detailing Uncle Alan's life without a clear connector
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "a thing" repeatedly without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between paragraphs, especially from family discussion to Uncle Alan's backstory

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
