Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "stuff") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical analysis and philosophical reflection without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Von Eicken, Sybel, Tocqueville) could affect comprehension.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
