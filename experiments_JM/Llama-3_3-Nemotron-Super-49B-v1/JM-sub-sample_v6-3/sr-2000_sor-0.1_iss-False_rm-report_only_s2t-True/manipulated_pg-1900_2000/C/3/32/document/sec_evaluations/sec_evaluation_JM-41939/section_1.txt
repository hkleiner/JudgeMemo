- [LEXICON] "irksome task" (while not incorrect, somewhat formal/archaic for general readability)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Rosa's childhood activities to the revolution of 1830 without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear how the family's move to various locations (e.g., Rue Saint-Antoine, No. 30 "the thing", Rue du Helder) impacts the narrative's core
