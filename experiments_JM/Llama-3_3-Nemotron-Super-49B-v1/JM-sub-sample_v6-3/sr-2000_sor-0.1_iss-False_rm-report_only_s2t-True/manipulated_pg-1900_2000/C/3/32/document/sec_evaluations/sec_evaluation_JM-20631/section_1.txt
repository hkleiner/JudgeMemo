Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "recondite", "esoteric") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing Hebrew's revival and the "Chosen People" claim feels somewhat abrupt.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Arthur Davis's biography to the broader discussion of languages and then to the "Chosen People" concept could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
