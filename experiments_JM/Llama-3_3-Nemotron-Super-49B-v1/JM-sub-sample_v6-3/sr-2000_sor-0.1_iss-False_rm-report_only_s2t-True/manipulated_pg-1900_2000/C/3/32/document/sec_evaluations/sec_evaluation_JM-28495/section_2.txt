Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "venomous snap", "starchy white curtains") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the chase scene to the conversation about going home and then to advertising for a dog, lacking a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The character's emotional shift (Stella's frustration to sudden fear at the water) feels somewhat unexplained without additional context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
