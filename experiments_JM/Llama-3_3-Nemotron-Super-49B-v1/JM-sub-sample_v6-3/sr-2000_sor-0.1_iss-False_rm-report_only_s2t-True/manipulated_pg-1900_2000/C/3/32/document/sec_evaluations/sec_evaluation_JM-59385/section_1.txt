Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "tapestried box-like chairs" might slow reading for some)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a clearer connector)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Chinese customs and the significance of the Street of Precious Pearls without explicit explanation within the segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
