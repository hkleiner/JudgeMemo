        • Overly formal and archaic language may impede readability for some readers (e.g., "seas of blood and tears", "pitiful condition")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, complex sentences (e.g., the paragraph discussing the role played by Russia in frustrating the initial German plan)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear references (e.g., "a thing", "the stuff" - presumably a translation or typing error, severely impacting clarity)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between the introductory chapter and the second chapter without a clear connector
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumption that the reader understands the historical context and specific military strategies without explanation
