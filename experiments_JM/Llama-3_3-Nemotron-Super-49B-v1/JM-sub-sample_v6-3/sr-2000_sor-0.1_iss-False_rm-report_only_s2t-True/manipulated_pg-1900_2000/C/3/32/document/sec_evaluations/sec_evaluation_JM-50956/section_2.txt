Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the stuff's condition would have been rendered critical"
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague placeholder "a thing" (likely an error or placeholder for a country name)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "when the English Army began to grow, and a stuff, Roumania and a thing had abandoned their neutrality" (punctuation and clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of "the Moltke plan" without brief recap in this context
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from historical analysis to criticizing General Ludendorf's memoirs
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in paragraphs discussing military strategies and their outcomes

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
