Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling added no little to the discomfort of the situation."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "disagreeableness", "intra muros").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing personal discomfort to historical context of Manila.
- [CLARITY] The notice at the end feels disconnected from the preceding descriptive passage without clear contextual lead-in.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
