Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "mitrailleuses", "horizon blue") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing war scenes to the narrator's trip planning without a clear connecting phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between different locations and ideas (battlefield, Mayor's story, Minist√®re de la Guerre, train station) without a strong unifying thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
