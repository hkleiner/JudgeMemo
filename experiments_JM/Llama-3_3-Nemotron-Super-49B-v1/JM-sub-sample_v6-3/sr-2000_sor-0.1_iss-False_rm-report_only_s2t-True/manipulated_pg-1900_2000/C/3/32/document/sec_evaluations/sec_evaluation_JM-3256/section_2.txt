Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sinewy English style", "acquired taste", "immortality of necessity")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences require careful parsing

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing "Mark Rutherford" and introducing the critic's role
- [CLARITY] The quote from Sainte-Beuve, while illustrative, slightly disrupts the flow with its abstract nature

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
