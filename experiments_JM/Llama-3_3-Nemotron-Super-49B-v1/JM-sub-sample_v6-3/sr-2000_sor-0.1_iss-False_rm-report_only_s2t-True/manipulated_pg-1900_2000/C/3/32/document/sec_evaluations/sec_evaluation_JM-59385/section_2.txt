Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other had stilled her lips...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices or phrases ("a thing and West", "squandered your valuable time") could be more precise or idiomatic.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the memory of Miss Porter to the present with Madame Yen (could benefit from a smoother transition).
- [CLARITY] The conflict's resolution ("Kuei Pingâ€™s decision was reached...") feels somewhat abrupt and could be more elaborated for better understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
