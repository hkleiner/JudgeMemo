Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "damnatory", "exorbitant", "unlooked-for") might challenge casual readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic development to the financial struggles and back without clear transitional phrases
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment (jumps between different periods of Meissonier's early career) without explicit chronological markers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
