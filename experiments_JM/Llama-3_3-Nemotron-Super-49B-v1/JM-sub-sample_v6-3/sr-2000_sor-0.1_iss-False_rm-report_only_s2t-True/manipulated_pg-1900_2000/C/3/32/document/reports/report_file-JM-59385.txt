Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "tapestried box-like chairs" might slow reading for some)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a clearer connector)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumption of prior knowledge about Chinese customs and the significance of the Street of Precious Pearls without explicit explanation within the segment

Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other had stilled her lips...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some word choices or phrases ("a thing and West", "squandered your valuable time") could be more precise or idiomatic.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from the memory of Miss Porter to the present with Madame Yen (could benefit from a smoother transition).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The conflict's resolution ("Kuei Ping’s decision was reached...") feels somewhat abrupt and could be more elaborated for better understanding.
