Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", implied but not directly used here, yet overall tone suggests period language) and less common terms (e.g., "feluccas", "Riva dei Schiavoni") might require reader effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's artistic style to his biography without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., Venetian Republic, specific artists) without brief explanation might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
