Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but "whilst" and similar might be) could slightly hinder modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced historical figures without introduction.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing "The Wedding at Cana" to introducing "Veronese and the Inquisition" without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
