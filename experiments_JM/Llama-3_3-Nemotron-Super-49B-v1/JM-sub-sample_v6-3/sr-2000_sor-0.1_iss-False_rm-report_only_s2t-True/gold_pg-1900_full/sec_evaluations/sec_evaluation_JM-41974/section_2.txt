Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If the models that passed in endless procession before his eyes impressed him as magnificent opportunities...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "enamoured", "disinterestedness", "mettlesome") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section transitions abruptly from describing Veronese's artistic influences to detailing his personal life without a clear connecting link.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Venetian artists and historical context (e.g., "the Most Serene Republic") could affect comprehension for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
