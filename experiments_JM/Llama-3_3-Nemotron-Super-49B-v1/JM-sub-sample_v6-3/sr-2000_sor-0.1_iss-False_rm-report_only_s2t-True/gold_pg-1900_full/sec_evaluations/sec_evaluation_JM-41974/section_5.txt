Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "enslaved to forced labor") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's return to Venice to detailing a specific painting ("The Family of Darius...").
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about rolling up the canvas, while engaging, slightly disrupts the flow of biographical and artistic analysis.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
