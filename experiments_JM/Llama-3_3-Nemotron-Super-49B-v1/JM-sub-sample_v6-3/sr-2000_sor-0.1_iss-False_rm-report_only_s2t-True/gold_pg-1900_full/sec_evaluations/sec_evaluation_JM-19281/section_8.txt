Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some vocabulary (e.g., "inviolable", "paradoxically") might be less accessible to non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition between discussing unity and the corollary of abandoning faith in God could be smoother.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Bahá'í community's example to the broader philosophical discussion feels somewhat disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
