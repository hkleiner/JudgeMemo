Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "The process bears within itself...").
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic language ("thou", "thee", "verily") may hinder modern readability.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing spiritual search to the "CHAPTER" section.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs overly dense with unreferenced scriptural quotes, potentially confusing without context.
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with "the Master" without clear introduction in this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
