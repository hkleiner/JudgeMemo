Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stultify", "inimical") might require additional interpretation for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the evolutionary nature of religious practices and the critique of theological presumption could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The incorporation of quotes from different religious texts, while enriching, slightly disrupts the flow for readers unfamiliar with the contexts.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
