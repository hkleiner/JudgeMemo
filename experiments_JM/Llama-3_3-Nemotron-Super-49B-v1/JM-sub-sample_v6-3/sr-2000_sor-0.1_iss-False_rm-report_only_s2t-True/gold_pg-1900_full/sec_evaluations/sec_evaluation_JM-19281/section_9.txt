Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or highly formal vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", in quoted text; "unconstrained", "nethermost") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with Bahá'í concepts and history without explicit explanation within the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing evil and unity to outlining the Bahá'í community's growth plans without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
