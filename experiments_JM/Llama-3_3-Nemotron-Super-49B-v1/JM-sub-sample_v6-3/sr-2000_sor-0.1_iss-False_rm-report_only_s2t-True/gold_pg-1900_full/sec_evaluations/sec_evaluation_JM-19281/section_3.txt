Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "inasmuch", "thereof", "whence") might reduce accessibility for a broad audience.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the limitations of traditional religions and the introduction of the Bahá'í perspective could be more explicitly connected for smoother logical flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between various themes (e.g., critique of current religious practices, introduction of Bahá'í teachings, societal changes) without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
