Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "inextinguishable urge", "animating principle") might require additional interpretation time for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the nature of religion and the introduction of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between conceptual discussions and direct quotes without clear transitional phrases, potentially disrupting flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
