Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "inexhaustible", "sombre", "patrimony").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the failure of materialism directly leads to a spiritual search without fully exploring counterarguments or alternatives.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the failure of materialism to introducing global integration without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
