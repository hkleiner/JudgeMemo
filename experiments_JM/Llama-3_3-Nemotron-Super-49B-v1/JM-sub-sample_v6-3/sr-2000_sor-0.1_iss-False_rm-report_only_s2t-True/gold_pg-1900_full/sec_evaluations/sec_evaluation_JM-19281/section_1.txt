Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat formal and less common vocabulary (e.g., "indefeasible inheritance", "desolating affliction") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between discussing the open letter and introducing "One Common Faith" commentary could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs tackle multiple, closely related but distinct ideas, potentially causing slight confusion without careful reading.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
