Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "intractable", "condign", "draconian") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with specific historical and religious contexts (e.g., Bahá'u'lláh's mission, Qur'án's injunctions) without brief elaboration.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shifts between discussing past religious influences and modern societal needs could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
