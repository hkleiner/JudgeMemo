Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "renannouncement", "futile theory", "amused at my impotence")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about characters' thoughts/feelings without clear textual evidence (e.g., "he was amiably amused at my impotence")
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative's reflective mode and the direct conversation setup (e.g., the shift to "IT was therefore from her husband I could never remove my eyes")
- [CLARITY] Some sentences require re-reading due to dense, indirect expression of the narrator's thoughts (e.g., "only rounded it off with a mystery finer and subtler")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
