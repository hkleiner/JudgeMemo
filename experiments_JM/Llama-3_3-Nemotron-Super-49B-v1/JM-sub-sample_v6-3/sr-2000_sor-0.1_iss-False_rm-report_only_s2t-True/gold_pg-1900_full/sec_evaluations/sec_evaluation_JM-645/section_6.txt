Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "I had taken to the man still more than I had ever taken to the books.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "out-Herod", "priggishness")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative need)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in topic from Corvick's journey to the analogy with gamblers at Monte Carlo feels somewhat abrupt
- [TRANSITION] Transition between the discussion of Corvick's relationship status and the literary pursuit could be smoother
- [CLARITY] The depth of emotional impact on the narrator and Gwendolen Erme, while mostly clear, has moments of vague expression (e.g., "moved to such depths")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
