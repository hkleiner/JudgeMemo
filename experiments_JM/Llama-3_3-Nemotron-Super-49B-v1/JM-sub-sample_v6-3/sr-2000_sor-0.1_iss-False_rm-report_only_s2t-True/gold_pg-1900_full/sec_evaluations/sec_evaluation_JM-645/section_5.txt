Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some passages (e.g., "Deep down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy, I was expectant.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "bedlamitical", "stupefied")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Mild inconsistency in the narrator's expressed emotions towards Corvick's pursuit (critique vs. underlying expectation of success)
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting between the narrator's reflections and the described scenes (e.g., transitioning to the chess analogy)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
