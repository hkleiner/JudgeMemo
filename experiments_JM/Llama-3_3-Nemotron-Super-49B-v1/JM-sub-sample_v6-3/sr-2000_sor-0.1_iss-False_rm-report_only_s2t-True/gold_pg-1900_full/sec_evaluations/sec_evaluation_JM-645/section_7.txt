Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I seemed to remember myself at this time as rattling constantly between the little house in Chelsea and my own.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "secousse", "prig", "tantes") may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Gwendolen's marital status without prior context
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous implication of George's message ("Tellement envie de voir ta tÃªte!")
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the discussion of the letter and the recollection of George's previous statements

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
