Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some passages (e.g., "I had at first found a way to persuade myself...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "maturer grace", "incontestably handsome", "trepidation")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the mystery of Vereker's secret to the protagonist's personal feelings and interactions without clear transitional phrases
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression within the segment, jumping between different time frames and ideas (e.g., discussing the novel "Overmastered" and then shifting to "The Right of Way" without clear connectors)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
