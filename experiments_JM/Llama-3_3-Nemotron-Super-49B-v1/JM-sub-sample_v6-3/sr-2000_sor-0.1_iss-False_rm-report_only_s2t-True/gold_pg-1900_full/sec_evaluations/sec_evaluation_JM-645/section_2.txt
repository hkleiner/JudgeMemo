Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was plain he really feared I was hurt, and the sense of his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "unmodulated", "stupefaction") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting from dinner table conversation to the hallway encounter without a clear temporal marker.
- [CLARITY] Vereker's revelation about being a "failure" feels somewhat unprepared; more contextual buildup could enhance its impact.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
