Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I hadn’t so much as hinted at that: no wonder the writer hadn’t been flattered!")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "vulgar" in context, "perversely") might require a second read for full comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnect between the intense pursuit of Vereker's secret and the casual, almost dismissive, tone in some interactions (e.g., Vereker's "It doesn’t matter—don’t worry")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the detailed conversation analyses to the broader, more reflective statements about the outcome (e.g., the transition into "The great point of it all is...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
