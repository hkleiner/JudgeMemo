Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "avidity", "touvaille", "connoisseur") might require additional mental processing.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing the protagonist's brother to George Corvick's letter and project, potentially confusing readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to guide the reader more effectively through the shifting topics.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
