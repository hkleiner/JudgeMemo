Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "Nimmuria", "Tushratta") might require additional context for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Tushratta's letters and introducing Napkhuria/Akhenaten.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume prior knowledge of the historical context (e.g., roles of various kings, geopolitical relationships).
