Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "unparalleled", "tenfold") might require additional effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from discussing the prince of Alashia to Tushratta and Napkhuria's interaction feels somewhat disconnected.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between multiple storylines (e.g., plague mention, diplomatic exchanges) without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
