Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "promiscuous warfare") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from discussing Aziru's actions to the broader geopolitical context (e.g., introduction of Labaya without clear connection) slightly disrupts flow.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between different vassal leaders' stories (e.g., from Rib-Addi to Aziru to Akizzi) could be smoother for better coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
