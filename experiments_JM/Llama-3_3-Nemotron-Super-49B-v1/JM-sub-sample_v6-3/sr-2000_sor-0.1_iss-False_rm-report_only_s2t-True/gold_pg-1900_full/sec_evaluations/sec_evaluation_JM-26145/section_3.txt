Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "Pidati", "Shirtani") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between describing historical events and explaining diplomatic correspondence without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of ancient geopolitical dynamics and figures (e.g., Kadashman-Bel, Tushratta) could confuse readers without that background.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
