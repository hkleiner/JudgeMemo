Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Something blurred the surgeon’s eyes." feels abrupt)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "ghastly wound" is clear, but "tremor shook him like a chill" could be more nuanced)
- [PUNCTUATION] Effective use overall, but a few places could benefit from added pauses for dramatic effect (e.g., before "But I will come back to America.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor disconnect in the transition from Debby's emotional revelation to the sudden planning for England without clear motivation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the intense emotional scene with Washington to the lighthearted, future-planning scene at Doctor Bell’s mother’s home
- [CLARITY] Debby's internal conflict about her identity and past could be more explicitly connected to her future actions and decisions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
