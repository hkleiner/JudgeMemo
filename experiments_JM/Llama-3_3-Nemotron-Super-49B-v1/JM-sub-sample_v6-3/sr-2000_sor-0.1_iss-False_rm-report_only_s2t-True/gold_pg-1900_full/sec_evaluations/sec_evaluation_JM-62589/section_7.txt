Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "For during the time which lay between his leaving Boston and now as he sat beside the Delaware river in New Jersey, Shirtliffe had not seen, or heard of Morley."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may hinder smooth reading for some audiences (e.g., "stinging tears of agony", "fraught with keenest joy")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the blood already was showing through the new bandages" (should be "the blood was already...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's personal struggle to the interaction with Washington without clear transition
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the message to the Marblehead fishermen is not explicitly stated, assuming prior knowledge
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt ending to the segment without tying back to Robert's main goal (finding Morley)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
