Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward sentence structure in "Hungry, starving Debby rushed to fill her motherâ€™s place!" (could be more concise)
- [LEXICON] Overly sentimental language in some phrases (e.g., "blessed chance", "loving waiting hearts") may feel less nuanced

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the emotional reunion to the introduction of Doctor Bell's confession without clearer connection
- [CLARITY] The character development of Doctor Bell's transformation feels somewhat rushed and unexplained

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
