Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Since her mother had died five years before she had led a wild uncared-for existence.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("lass", "thou", "thee") might reduce readability for modern readers without historical context familiarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional turmoil to the detailed description of her life under Mrs. Lane.
- [CLARITY] The shift in narrative focus (from immediate conflict to past reflections) could be smoother for enhanced flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
