Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "A blur passed over Mason’s eyes. His senses became more muddled.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "hic", "’Pon my soul")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in a few transitions between paragraphs)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of the second character with a strong resemblance to Robert feels somewhat unprepared
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from the camp scene to Robert's solo journey without clear transitional context
- [CLARITY] Mason's transformation from confusion to sudden clarity feels rushed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
