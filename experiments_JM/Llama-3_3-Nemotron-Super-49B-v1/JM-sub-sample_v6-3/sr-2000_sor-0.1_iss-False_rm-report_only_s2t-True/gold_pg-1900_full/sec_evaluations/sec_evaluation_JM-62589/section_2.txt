Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "How Debby loathed that service. In half an hour Mrs. Lane would mount the stair, rod in hand, to settle her account with the imprisoned sinner, and in half an hour, at a certain woods of which Debby knew, that rascal Jack Martin would be in waiting..."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "gloaming", "gaby", "whither away so fast")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "at a certain woods" (should be "at certain woods" or "at a certain set of woods")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Debby's emotional reflection to her decision to disguise as a boy without clear transitional thought process
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene change from Debby's room to the woods without a clear temporal or spatial bridge
- [CLARITY] The motivation behind Debby's decision to confront Jack in disguise could be more clearly established

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
