Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, complex sentences (e.g., "He could never find Debby now, perhaps. Ere another day had passed he too might be lying dead.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic language use (e.g., "Methinks", not present but "Ere" is used, and overall formal tone)
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of commas for sentence clarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Robert's thoughts to the British sentinels' actions without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment (flashbacks and future references without smooth integration)
- [CLARITY] Overly dramatic language sometimes obscures the immediate context (e.g., "Something like a sob mingled with the drum beats.")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
