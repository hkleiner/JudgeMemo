Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "The strange resemblance was to serve him well, now, if only the Englishmen were not too intimate with the real man, and the darkness and his keen talent for mimicry would help him out.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "waning light", "daredevil")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in Robert's (Shirtliffe's) ability to convincingly mimic Morley without prior indication of such skill
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the emotional scene with Mason's death to the strategic conversation with the British riders

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
