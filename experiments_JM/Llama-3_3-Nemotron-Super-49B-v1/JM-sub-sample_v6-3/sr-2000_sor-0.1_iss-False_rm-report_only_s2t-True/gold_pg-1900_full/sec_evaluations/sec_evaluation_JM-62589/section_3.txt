Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Not long after he had enlisted he was sitting, with some others, around a camp fire trying to forget, in the grateful glow, how hungry and cold he was"
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in dialogue (e.g., "With your permission, sir") may feel inconsistent with character portrayals
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "entered the headquarters of the bedraggled army entrenched on Prospect Hill" (should be "a bedraggled army")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Debby's decision to join the army to introducing "Robert Shirtliffe" without clear connection or transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt chapter ending and start without resolving Debby's storyline before introducing a new character/scenario
- [CLARITY] Unclear how "Robert Shirtliffe" relates to previous characters/events until much later, causing initial confusion

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
