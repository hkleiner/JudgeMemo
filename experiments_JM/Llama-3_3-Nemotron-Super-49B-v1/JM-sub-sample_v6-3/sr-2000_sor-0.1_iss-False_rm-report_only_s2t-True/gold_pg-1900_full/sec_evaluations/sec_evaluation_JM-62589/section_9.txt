Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some dialogues (e.g., "If I go, you will have to carry me dead.")
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "confound you")
- [PACING] Rapid shifts between action, dialogue, and introspection can disrupt flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of Morley without clear contextual setup within the segment
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the duel scene to Robert's solitary reflection and then to Morley's death scene
- [CLARITY] Morley's messages and their significance could be more clearly contextualized for immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
