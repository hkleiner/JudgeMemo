Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence transitions (e.g., "What were his hopes and sorrows now?" after a descriptive paragraph)
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language may disrupt flow for some readers (e.g., "an awful agony took possession of his last conscious thought")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense (e.g., "He had fainted once that day" to "God keep him from another attack!")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "Molly" without clear context within the segment
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment can confuse without prior context
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., Robert's secret, the significance of finding "the other boy") could be clearer

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
