Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "We have seen how important and essential a part Russia played in the overthrow of German militarism.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "Russia" without variation (could use "The Russian Army", "Russia's forces", etc.)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing Oxford commas for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russia's future power is inevitable without clear evidence
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing WWI to speculating about future geopolitical scenarios
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, making the flow less straightforward

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
