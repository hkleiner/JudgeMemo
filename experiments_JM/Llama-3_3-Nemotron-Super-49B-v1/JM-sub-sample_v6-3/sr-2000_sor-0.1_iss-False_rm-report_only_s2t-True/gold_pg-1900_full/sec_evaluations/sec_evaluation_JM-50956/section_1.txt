Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "millions" (repeated for emphasis, not an error but could vary for style)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "strenuous campaign", "belligerents") may slightly impede modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russia's role is underappreciated without direct comparison to others' contributions in the same context.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Russia's sacrifices to analyzing Germany's potential for winning without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
