Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was quite impossible, too, short of locking him up, to prevent him from accompanying us when we took our walks abroad, if he had made up his mind to do so.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "perambulators", "d√©tour", "patrician calm") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different anecdotes (e.g., from the walk to the dinner party to the walk again) without clear transitional phrases, potentially disrupting flow.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt reveal of "Excalibur's bone" feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding dinner party description, though it is a pivotal comedic moment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
