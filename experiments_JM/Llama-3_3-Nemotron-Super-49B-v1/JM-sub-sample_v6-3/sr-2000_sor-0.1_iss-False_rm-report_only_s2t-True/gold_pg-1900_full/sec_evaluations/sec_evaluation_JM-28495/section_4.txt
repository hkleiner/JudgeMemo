Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was his daily walk with Eileen, however, which introduced Excalibur to life--life in its broadest and most romantic sense.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "eminence", "anteater's tongue", "Leander scratch eight") might require additional processing for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Excalibur's antics to the narrative's shift in focus towards Eileen and the curate's interaction, potentially disrupting flow
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the timeline and the narrator's presence/absence in key scenes (e.g., "As I was not privileged to be present...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
