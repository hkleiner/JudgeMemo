1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly abrupt transition between "This was true enough..." and the preceding dialogue, disrupting flow.
- [LEXICON] Informal "thirsty weather" in formal context, minor stylistic inconsistency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "Excalibur" without prior context (within this segment), assuming external knowledge.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from dialogue to descriptive narrative ("Its tongue lolled..."), though effective, slightly jarring.
