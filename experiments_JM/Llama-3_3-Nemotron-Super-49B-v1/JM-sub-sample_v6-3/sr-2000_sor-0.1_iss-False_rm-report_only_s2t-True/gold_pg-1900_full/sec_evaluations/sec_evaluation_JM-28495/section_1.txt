Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dernier cri", "bonhomie") might require additional cognitive effort for less literate readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase deliberations, and the quest for the Lost Dogs' Home, which, while mostly coherent, might slightly disorient some readers due to the breadth of topics.
- [CLARITY] The transition from discussing dog breeds to following the Battersea Home official could be slightly smoother for enhanced flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
