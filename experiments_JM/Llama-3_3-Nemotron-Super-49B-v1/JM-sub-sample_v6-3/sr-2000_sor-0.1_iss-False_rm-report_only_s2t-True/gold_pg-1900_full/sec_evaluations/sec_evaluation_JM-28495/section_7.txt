Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence transitions (e.g., "It was dawn--gray, weeping, and cheerless--on Tetley Moor." lacks a clear link to the previous sentence)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "bouleversement", "corroborative")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had been brought" to "was hauled" without clear temporal progression)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unannounced shift from the train accident to Lord Caversham's encounter with Excalibur (lacks transitional element)
- [CLARITY] The character "Excalibur" is introduced without immediate context for new readers (assuming this segment is read in isolation)
- [LOGIC] The swift resolution and convenient timing of events (e.g., the doctor's immediate presence, the swift extraction of the commercial traveler) may strain believability

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
