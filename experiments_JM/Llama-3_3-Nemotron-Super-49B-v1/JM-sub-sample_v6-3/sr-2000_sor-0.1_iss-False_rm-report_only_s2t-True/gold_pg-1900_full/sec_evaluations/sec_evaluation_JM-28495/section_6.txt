Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He was going to visit friends in the north. Aren't you, darling?" (informal tag in formal context)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in "Excalibur, instinctively realizing that this was an occasion when liberties might be taken" (could be simplified for better flow)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Eileen took him up to London by train" (could imply "by train" is the primary mode, but not entirely clear without context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Excalibur's journey to the coroner's jury section (CHAPTER VII starts abruptly without clear connection)
- [CLARITY] Unclear motivation behind Eileen's demonstrative behavior towards Excalibur vs. the curate (needs more contextual buildup)
- [LOGIC] Excalibur's sudden understanding and pursuit of the taxi feels slightly implausible without more emotional setup

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
