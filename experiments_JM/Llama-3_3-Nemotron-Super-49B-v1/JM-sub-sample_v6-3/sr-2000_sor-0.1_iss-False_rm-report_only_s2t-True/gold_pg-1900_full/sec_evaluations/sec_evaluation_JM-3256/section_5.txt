Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "tree-calf", "tooled morocco") may hinder readability for non-specialists.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph starting with "When the bookman is a family man...") slightly impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The analogy between dipsomania and bibliomania, while engaging, slightly overstays its welcome and disrupts the narrative flow in the latter part.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the bookman's condition to the pledge scenario without a clearer connecting thought.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
