Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gainsborough", "romney", "liotard") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical narrative, artistic analysis, and historical context without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 18th-century British art and history might leave some readers disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
