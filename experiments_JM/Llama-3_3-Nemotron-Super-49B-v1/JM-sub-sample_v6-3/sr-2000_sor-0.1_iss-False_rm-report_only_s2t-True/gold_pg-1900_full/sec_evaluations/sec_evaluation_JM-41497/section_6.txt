Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "nether", implied but not present; however, "ambrosia" and "nexus" are actually used) could slightly hinder readability for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing Reynolds' approach to painting different subjects (women/children vs. men) and the impact of his work's aging process without a clear transitional link.
- [CLARITY] The assertion about Reynolds' personal life (celibacy) feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the analysis on his painting styles and subjects.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
