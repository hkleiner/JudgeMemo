Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "laid his brush aside") and formal language might slightly hinder fluency for modern readers unfamiliar with the style.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., from Reynolds' honors to his travels to specific artworks) without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences assume prior knowledge of the art world or historical figures (e.g., the significance of the Low Countries visit), which could confuse uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
