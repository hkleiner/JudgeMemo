Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Nay, did he not even admit it...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "Ay", "Wit", and "thou" implied in tone)
- [LENGTH] Extremely long sentences (e.g., the first sentence of the second paragraph)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shift from Boucher's death to political intrigue)
- [CLARITY] Overly dense historical context assumes high prior knowledge
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between Fragonard's personal life and broader historical events

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
