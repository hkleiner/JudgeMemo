Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "For several months he did no work, or little work; and though he stood before the masterpieces...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "kinsman", "Rabelaisian wag", "dazed wits") might require additional context for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumping between Fragonard's development, historical events, and relationships) can disrupt seamless progression.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between detailed artistic development and broader historical context (e.g., the stabbing of the king) without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
