Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "The state of misery and want amongst the artists and their wives and families at this time was pitiable.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for modern readers (e.g., "travail", "plebeian", "bourgeois")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical context and Fragonard's personal story (e.g., shifting from Revolution details to Fragonard's departure to Grasse)
- [CLARITY] Overly broad historical spans covered without clear chronological markers, potentially confusing the timeline for some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
