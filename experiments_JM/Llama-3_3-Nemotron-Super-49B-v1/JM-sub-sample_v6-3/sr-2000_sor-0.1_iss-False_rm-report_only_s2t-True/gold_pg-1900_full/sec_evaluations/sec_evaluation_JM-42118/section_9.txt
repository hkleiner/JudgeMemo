Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pen-picture", "frizzed out") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from descriptive biography to art historical analysis (e.g., the transition to discussing Watteau, Boucher, and the essence of 17th-century French art).
- [STRUCTURE] The section blends chronological narrative with thematic analysis without clear segmentation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
