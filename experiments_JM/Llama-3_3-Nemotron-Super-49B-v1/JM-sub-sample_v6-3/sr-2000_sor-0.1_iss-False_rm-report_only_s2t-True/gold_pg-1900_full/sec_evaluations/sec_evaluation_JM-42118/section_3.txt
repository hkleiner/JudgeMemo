Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He had indeed no taste for such things, no sympathy with ancient thought nor with the dead past.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fickle fashion", "ardent brush") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Fragonard's artistic development to the detailed description of the court and Du Barry era without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures (e.g., Diderot, Grimm, Du Barry) and artistic movements without brief contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
