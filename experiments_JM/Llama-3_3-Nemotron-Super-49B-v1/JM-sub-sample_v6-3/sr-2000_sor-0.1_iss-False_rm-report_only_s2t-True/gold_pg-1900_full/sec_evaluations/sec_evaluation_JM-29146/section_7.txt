Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in hyper-space explanations (e.g., "since there isn't any time to measure extension with in hyper-space, since time doesn't exist here, you can't speak of mid-points.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly technical jargon without clear explanation for general audience (e.g., "duration-lag", "universe of extension")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances (e.g., "Ramsey was saying softly" followed by "blastoff!" without clear temporal transition)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Enterprise's preparations to Dog Star's crew without clear transitional phrase
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Margot's thoughts on proto-man to the Dog Star crew) without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Some sections assume prior knowledge of the universe's lore (e.g., hyper-space mechanics, proto-man's significance) without sufficient context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
