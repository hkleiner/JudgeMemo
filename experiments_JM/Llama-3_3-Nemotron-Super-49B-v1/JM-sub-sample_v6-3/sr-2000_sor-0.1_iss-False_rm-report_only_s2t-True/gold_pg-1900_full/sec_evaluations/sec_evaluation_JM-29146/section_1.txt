Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, though stylistic choice)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic ("meth", "thou" in dialogue tags not present but "th" lisp is consistent)
- [SYNTAX] Minor sentence structure complexity may slow reading in a few instances

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene shift from Ramsey to the Earthgirl without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Earthgirl's backstory and abilities (reading minds) introduced abruptly without prior hint
- [LOGIC] The sudden introduction of the Earthgirl's panic and her connection to Ramsey feels unexplained

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
