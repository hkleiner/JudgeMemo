Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "If you do, and if you succeed, more power will be yours than a human being has ever before had in the galaxy.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "Sirian-archaic", "Spacer Graveyard" without prior context)
- [PACING] Abrupt shift in tone and subject between the scientific discussion and the personal, romantic interaction

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the reader is familiar with the broader universe's context (e.g., hyper-space, proto-man legend, interstellar travel norms)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of the wanted bulletin without clear buildup or immediate relevance explanation
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in Margot's mind-reading abilities (how they work, their limitations) and their impact on the plot

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
