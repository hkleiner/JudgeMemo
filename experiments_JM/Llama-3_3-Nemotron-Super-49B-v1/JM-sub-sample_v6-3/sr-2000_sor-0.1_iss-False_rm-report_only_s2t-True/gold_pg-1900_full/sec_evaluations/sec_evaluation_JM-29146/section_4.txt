Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "He slept like a log without dreaming. / He awoke with anxious hands fluttering at his shoulder.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "flurries of snow from the north" could be more dynamically phrased)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (though not severely distracting)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the apartment scene to the letter's content without clearer contextual setup
- [CLARITY] The letter's significance and its connection to the main plot could be more explicitly hinted at or integrated
- [LOGIC] Margot's character behavior (locking them in, then the importance of the letter) feels somewhat convenient for plot progression without deeper motivation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
