Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "You didn't breathe on a timeless world. You merely--somehow--existed." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similar adjectives (e.g., "loveliest", "beautiful", "sad") in describing the music
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Ramsey had not breathed, not once, since they left Enterprise." (should be "the Enterprise")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Inconsistency in the Irwadi's death (contradicts the established "timeless world" rules)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the vision to the new characters' arrival
- [CLARITY] Unclear motivation behind Garr Symm's sudden claim "The box is mine, mine!"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
