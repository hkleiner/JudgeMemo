Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt scene transitions (e.g., from Ramsey/Margot to Security Officer Chind without clear connection cues)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal dialogue in some sections (e.g., Security Officer's report) contrasts with more casual tones elsewhere
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few sentences (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative reason)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Unclear motivation behind Garr Symm's sudden reveal of long-term power ambitions without prior hints
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential information disclosure (e.g., the importance of the letter and its implications are hinted at late)
- [CLARITY] Character of Vardin feels somewhat peripheral with unclear depth or motivation beyond being "delighted"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
