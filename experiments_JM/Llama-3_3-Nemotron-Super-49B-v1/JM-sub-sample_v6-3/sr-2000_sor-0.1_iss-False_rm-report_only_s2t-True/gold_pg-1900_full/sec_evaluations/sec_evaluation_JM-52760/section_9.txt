Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "The result had been the capture of Petersburg and Richmond, but more important, it had led to the flight of the remnants...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "relentless attrition") might require a second read for full comprehension by non-experts.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the fall of Petersburg to the broader outcome of the war (e.g., the jump to "On the Sunday following...").
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of Appomattox Court House and its location relative to Petersburg might confuse some readers without context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
