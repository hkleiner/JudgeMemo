Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "abatis") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the Battle of Five Forks and the Fall of Petersburg/Richmond could be more explicitly connected.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from detailing the Battle of Five Forks to analyzing its significance without a clear separator.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
