Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the detailed attack plan description)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "ad libitum" in the context segment, though not in the evaluated segment, sets a tone; in the evaluated segment, "perplexed" and "vicious" are noted)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from detailing the attack's failure to introducing the new chapter "FIVE FORKS: BEGINNING OF THE END" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The large number of proper nouns (e.g., locations, generals' names) might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context, though this is somewhat mitigated by the subject matter's nature.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
