Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense sentence structures (e.g., "Strategically, despite the stalemate in Virginia, the beginning of 1864 found the Northern armies in a stronger position than the Confederate military forces.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stalemate", "marshaled", "outguessed") may slightly impede readability for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the broader war strategy to focusing on Petersburg without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of certain locations/battles without brief contextualization for unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
