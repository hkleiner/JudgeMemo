- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some domain-specific terms (e.g., "mini√© balls", "ravine") might require explanation for non-experts.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from tunnel construction details to battle strategy (around "Meanwhile...").
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed enumeration of troops and artillery at times distracts from the battle's flow.
