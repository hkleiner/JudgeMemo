Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "gabions") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the detailed battle descriptions and the timeline summaries (e.g., the shift to "JULY 30, 1864. The Crater...").
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of the broader campaign context (e.g., significance of specific railroads without explicit explanation).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
