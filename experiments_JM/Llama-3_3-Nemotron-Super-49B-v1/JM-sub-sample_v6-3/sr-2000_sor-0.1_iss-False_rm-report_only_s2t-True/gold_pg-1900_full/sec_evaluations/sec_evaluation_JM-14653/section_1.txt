Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "reliquary", "salvoes", "dissembling") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from nostalgic description to philosophical questioning without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The author's central argument about Christmas's "unreality" could be more directly stated earlier for clearer direction.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
