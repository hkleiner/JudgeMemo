Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple paragraphs (e.g., "But the accompaniments of the feast are also excessive...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "sirocco", "rejuvenators")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that emphasizing goodwill will automatically revitalize the festival without clear evidence or explanation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from defending feasting traditions to discussing festival revitalization without a clear connecting statement

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
