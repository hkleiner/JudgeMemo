Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "exacerbation", "fortitudes", "feats of intelligence") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between philosophical reflection, hypothetical scenarios, and personal application without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior understanding of the "social self-discipline" outlined in previous chapters may lead to confusion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
