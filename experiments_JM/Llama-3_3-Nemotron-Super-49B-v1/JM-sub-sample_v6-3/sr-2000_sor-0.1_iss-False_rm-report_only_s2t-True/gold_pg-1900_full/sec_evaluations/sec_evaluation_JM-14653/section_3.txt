Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If then, there is to be a festival, why should it not be the festival of Christmas? It can, indeed, be no other.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "insoluble", "fellowship", "altruistic") might require additional processing for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the existence of Christmas inherently makes it the best choice for a festival of goodwill without fully addressing potential counterarguments.
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in transitioning from discussing the importance of social justice faith to the necessity of festivals (could be smoother with a transitional phrase).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
