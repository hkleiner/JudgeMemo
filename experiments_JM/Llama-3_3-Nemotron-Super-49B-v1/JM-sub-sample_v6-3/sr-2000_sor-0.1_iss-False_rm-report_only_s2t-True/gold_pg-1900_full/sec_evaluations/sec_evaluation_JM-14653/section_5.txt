Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "omniscient girl of seventeen", "cog-wheels") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing the futility of societies for goodwill to the method of cultivating goodwill (at "I now come to the actual method...") could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The inclusion of "CHAPTER: SEVEN - THE GIFT OF ONESELF" disrupts the flow within the provided segment, making the text feel disjointed without the preceding context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
