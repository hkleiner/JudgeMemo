Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "And it is because they are the surest way to happiness, that the most enlightened go after them.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of abstract terms (e.g., "ideal", "self-conceit") without clear contextualization for general readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "I have realised" followed by "I have made" in close proximity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that all real motives are selfish without sufficient textual evidence or transition from previous context
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion to the example of the "average successful man" without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The concept of "higher egotism" and its distinction from "lower egotism" could be more clearly defined for immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
