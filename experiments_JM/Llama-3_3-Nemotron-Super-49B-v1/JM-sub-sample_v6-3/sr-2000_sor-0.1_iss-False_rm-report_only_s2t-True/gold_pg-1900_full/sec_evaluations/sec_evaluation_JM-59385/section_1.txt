Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic or less common vocabulary choices (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "lend light") might slightly hinder fluency for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school feels somewhat disconnected without a clearer transitional phrase or sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative's non-linear progression, while effective, might confuse readers not expecting the flashback without more preparatory context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
