Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hatamen", "lancan") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Kuei Ping's backstory to the narrator's perspective without clear transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumping between past and present, different narrative voices) could confuse readers without prior context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
