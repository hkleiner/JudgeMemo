Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutung", "gateman") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between present moments and future reflections (e.g., "The years that followed...") without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] The poem-like inserts (e.g., "Wherein...") disrupt the narrative flow and their integration could be more seamless.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
