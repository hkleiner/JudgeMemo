Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Carried by the devious ways of tongue and ear...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or culturally specific terms (e.g., "hutung", "mandarin robe") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression in some sections (e.g., the jump from Kuei Ping's thoughts on bearing a son to her daily life).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the family tribunal scene to the early autumn departure without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
