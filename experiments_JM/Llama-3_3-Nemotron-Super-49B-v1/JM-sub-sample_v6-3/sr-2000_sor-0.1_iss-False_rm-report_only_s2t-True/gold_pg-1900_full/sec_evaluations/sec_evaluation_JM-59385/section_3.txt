Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "She passed safely out of the womenâ€™s division of the compound, stealing through the intricate lacery of courtyards and curious-shaped gateways...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lacery", "quandary" not present but similar tone) might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the wedding festivities to Kuei Ping's nighttime escape without a clear transitional phrase or sentence.
- [CLARITY] The motivation behind Kuei Ping's decision to leave the compound could be more explicitly stated for immediate understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
