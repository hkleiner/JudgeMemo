Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "She saw him not as a destroyer of her trust, but as the victim of circumstances...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutungs", "hatamen", "amah") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Kuei Ping's introspection, her environment, and her family's situation without clear transitional phrases at times.
- [CLARITY] The shift in Kuei Ping's emotional state and realization could be more subtly integrated into the narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
