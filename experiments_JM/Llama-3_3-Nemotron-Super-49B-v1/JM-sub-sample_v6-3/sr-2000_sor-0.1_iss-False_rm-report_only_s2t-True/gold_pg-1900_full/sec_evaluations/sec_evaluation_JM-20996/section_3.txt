Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the last paragraph of Chapter IV)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "creditable squares", "biped mounts") that might slightly impede smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the emotional scene of departure to the descriptive passage about Philippine towns (between the end of the previous section and the start of Chapter IV)
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps between different time frames and locations (e.g., from the departure scene to Bacalod, then to Talisay) without clear transitional phrases

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
