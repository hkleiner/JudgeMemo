Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money; that they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a table loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were enthusiastic witnesses.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "luscious looking se√±oritas", "St. Vitus", "Terpsichore") might require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the dance to analyzing the Filipinos' wealth and dress without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about servants and housekeeping feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding social event description, with a slight thematic jump.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
