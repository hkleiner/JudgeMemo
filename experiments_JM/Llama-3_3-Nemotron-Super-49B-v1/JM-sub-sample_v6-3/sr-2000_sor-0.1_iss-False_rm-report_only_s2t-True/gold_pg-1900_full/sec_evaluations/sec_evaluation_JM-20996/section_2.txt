Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, complex sentences (e.g., first paragraph of "CHAPTER III")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading (e.g., "chased the hours with flying feet")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Manila's life to the notice about supplies without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The shift in scene (e.g., from Manila to the ship, to Capiz) could be more smoothly transitioned for better flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
