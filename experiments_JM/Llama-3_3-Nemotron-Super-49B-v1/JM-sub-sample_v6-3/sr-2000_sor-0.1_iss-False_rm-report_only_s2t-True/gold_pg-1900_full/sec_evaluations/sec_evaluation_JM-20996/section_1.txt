Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It has been the object of the writer to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of those things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of letters.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld", "revelry") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the voyage to detailing tourist attractions in Honolulu without clear thematic link.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of the International Date Line and its celebrations without brief explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
