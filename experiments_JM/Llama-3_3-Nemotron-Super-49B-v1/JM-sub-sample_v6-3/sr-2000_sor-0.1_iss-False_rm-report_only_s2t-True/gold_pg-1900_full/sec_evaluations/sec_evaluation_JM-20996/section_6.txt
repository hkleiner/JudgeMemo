Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the last paragraph of the first visit to the leper colony)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "indissoluble enigma", "unhospitable") may hinder readability for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing the leper colony visit to starting Chapter IX without a clear connecting transition
- [CLARITY] The narrative assumes prior knowledge of locations (e.g., Jimamaylan, Bacalod) without brief contextualization for unfamiliar readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
