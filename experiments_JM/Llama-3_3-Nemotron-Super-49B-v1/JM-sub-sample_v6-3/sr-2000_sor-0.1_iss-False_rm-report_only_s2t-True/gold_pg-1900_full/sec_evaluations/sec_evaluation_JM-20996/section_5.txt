Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to live there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to quaff the cup of its delights.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "idylic", "coup de main", "vehiclo", "sheep's-eye") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing life contrasts to entering a Filipino sitting-room without a clear connecting thought.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge (e.g., specifics of Filipino culture, "the great outer world") without sufficient context for all readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
