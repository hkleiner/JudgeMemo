Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or specialized vocabulary (e.g., "latten", "reticulated stonework") might challenge general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between descriptive, historical, and comparative analyses without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of referenced figures (e.g., Chaucer, Mr. Snowden Ward) and events (e.g., Reform Bill) might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
