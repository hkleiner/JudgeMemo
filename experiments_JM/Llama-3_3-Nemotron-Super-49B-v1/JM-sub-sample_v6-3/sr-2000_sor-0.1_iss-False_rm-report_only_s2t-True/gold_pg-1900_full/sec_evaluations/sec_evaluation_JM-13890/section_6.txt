Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "transfixed", "vivid reality", "uplifting effect on the mind") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive, historical, and somewhat philosophical narratives without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of the Cathedral's history and context (e.g., Becket's murder, specific Priors) could confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
