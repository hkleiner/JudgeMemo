Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of Becket's final moments)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "sumpter-mule") without clear necessity for the context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in a few transitional phrases)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from architectural history to the narrative of Becket's murder without a clear transitional link
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of Becket's story and its context (e.g., the conflict with Henry II)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of Dean Stanley's work without integrating its relevance smoothly

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
