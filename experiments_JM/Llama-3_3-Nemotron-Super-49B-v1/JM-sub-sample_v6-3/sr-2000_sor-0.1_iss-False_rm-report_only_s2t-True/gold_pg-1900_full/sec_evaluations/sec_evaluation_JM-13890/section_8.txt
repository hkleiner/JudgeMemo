Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thurled", "desultory", "thurled" not present but similar examples) might require a second read for full comprehension by all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between describing the city's walls, the Abbey, and other landmarks without a clear transitional flow between these topics.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Canterbury's history and layout might leave some readers disconnected from the narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
