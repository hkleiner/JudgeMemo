Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long descriptive sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "coquettish, rakish hats", "caulked with manure") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive narratives, daily life observations, and specific event descriptions without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of regional customs and geography (e.g., "the Tienshan heights", "Dungan revolt") without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
