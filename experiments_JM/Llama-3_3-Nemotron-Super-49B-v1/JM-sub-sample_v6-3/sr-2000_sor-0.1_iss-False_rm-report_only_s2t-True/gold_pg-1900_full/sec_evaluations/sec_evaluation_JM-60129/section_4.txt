Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "The river bed here is about 2 km wide but it broadens to the south...") 
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "stony ground" might be more commonly described as "rocky" or "gravelly" terrain)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the journey to detailing the monastery's appearance without a clear linking sentence
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about locations (e.g., K'anglungssu's significance) without brief contextualization for the unaware reader

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
