Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "potatow-noses" (likely typo for "potato-noses")
- [LEXICON] "on the contrarys" (should be "on the contrary")
- [SYNTAX] Table format disrupts text flow (though understandable as supplementary data)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from descriptive text to statistical table
- [CLARITY] Contradiction between statistical data and general information (needs clearer reconciliation)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift to departure on "the morning of the 16th" without contextual link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
