Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the last sentence of the text)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing clothing to discussing economic conditions without a clear connector
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about specific cultural practices and measurements (e.g., "tomash√°", anthropological measurements context)
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unsupported speculation about the cause of the people's lack of energy
