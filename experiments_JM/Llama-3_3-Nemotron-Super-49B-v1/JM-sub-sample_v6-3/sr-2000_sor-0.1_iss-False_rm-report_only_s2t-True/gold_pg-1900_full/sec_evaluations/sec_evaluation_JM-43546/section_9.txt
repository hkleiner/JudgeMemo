Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, affecting flow.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "clay biggin") might hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the picnic narrative to visiting Robert Burns's house without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Scottish history and literature (e.g., "Rob Roy", "The Lady of the Lake") without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.
