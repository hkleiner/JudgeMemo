Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., "It was here that Sir Walter often came, and Doctor Gordon showed the children the stone which was the great man's favourite seat.")
- [LEXICON] Informal, somewhat archaic language may affect modern readability (e.g., "lassies", "eh")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "was" and "were" in close proximity without clear narrative shift)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Melrose Abbey to the High Street memorial cross without clear linking
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "Rob Roy" and his significance without introduction in this segment
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in scene from Abbotsford to the Gordon house without transitional phrase or sentence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
