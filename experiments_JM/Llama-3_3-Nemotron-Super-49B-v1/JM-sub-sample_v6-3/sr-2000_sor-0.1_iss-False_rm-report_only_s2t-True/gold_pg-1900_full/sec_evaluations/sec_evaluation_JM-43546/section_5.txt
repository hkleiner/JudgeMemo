Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bawbee", "cairngorms") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between different locations and topics (e.g., from Holyrood Palace to the school of medicine, then to a new chapter and a different activity) without strong transitional links.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge (e.g., the story of the faithful dog, specifics about Scottish history and figures) might confuse readers without that background.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
