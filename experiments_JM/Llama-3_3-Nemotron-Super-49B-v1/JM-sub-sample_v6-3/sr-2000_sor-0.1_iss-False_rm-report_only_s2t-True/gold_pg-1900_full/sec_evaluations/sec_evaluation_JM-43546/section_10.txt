Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted (e.g., descriptions of the cruise).
- [LEXICON] Informal expressions (e.g., "lots and lots", "you know you would") may detract from formal fluency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the cruise to introducing the visit of American cousins.
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps abruptly to "THE END" without a clear conclusion for all storylines.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
