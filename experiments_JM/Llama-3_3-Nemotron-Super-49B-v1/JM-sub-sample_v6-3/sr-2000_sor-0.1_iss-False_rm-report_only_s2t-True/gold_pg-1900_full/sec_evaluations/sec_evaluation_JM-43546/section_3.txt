Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., descriptions of Sandy's chicken venture, historical explanations)
- [LEXICON] Informal, explanatory tone sometimes disrupts formal flow (e.g., "Oh!", "you know what boys are")
- [SPELLING] None detected
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "it is difficult to see" (could imply a missing link in explanation, though grammatically correct)
- [PUNCTUATION] None detected

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from educational/cultural topics to "A WALK IN EDINBURGH" without clear transition
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between paragraphs (e.g., from golf to Newhaven, to tea, to Sunday habits, to the new chapter)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge (e.g., "Tales of a Grandfather" without introduction)
- [LOGIC] None detected in argument flow, but topics seem loosely connected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
