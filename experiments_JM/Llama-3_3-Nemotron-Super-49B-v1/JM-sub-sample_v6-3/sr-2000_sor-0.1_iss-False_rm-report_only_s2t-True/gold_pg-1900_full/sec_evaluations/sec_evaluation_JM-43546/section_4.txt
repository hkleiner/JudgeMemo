Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was a gay little party that got off an electric car...").
- [LEXICON] Some vocabulary might be less familiar to non-Scottish readers (e.g., "cairngorm stone", "sporran", "claymore", "skean-dhu"), potentially slowing reading flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the children's game to the doctor's call and then to the detailed tour of Edinburgh, slightly disrupting the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Scottish history and clans might confuse some readers without that background.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
