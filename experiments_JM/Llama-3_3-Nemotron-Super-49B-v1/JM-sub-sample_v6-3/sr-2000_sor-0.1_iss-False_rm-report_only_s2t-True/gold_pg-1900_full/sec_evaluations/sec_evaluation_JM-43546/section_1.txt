Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., Donald's explanation to Sandy) that slightly impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some potentially unfamiliar terms for non-Scottish readers (e.g., "wee bairn", "bairn" itself, "scones" without immediate context for all audiences).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the puppy's introduction to the detailed description of Scottish tea time, slightly disconnecting the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Scottish culture (e.g., meal times, specific foods) might confuse some readers without the provided context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
