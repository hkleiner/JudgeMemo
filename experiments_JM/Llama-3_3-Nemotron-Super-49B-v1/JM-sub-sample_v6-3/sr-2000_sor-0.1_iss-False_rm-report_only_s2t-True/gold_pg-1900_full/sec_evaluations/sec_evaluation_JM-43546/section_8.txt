Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "What was it all about? Well, it was St. Patrick's Day..." (abrupt transition)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some descriptions (e.g., "with great jollification", "in a most excited manner") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "Our crowd is going to be at the top of the street, so hurry up" (informal, but clear; borderline issue)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing Scottish customs to introducing a St. Patrick's Day conflict without clear connection
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt move from the New Year's Eve scene to the St. Patrick's Day narrative without transitional element
- [CLARITY] Assumption that readers are familiar with the significance of blue and green ribbons in the context (minor, as context is briefly provided)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
