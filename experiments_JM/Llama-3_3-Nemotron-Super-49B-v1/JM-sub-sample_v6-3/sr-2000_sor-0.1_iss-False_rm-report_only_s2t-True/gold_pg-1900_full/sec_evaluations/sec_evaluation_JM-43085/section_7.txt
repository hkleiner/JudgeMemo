Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "In spite of all this, when the picture was finished and more than finished...").
- [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "cubic metres", "bias") might require additional cognitive effort for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Meissonier's costume collection to discussing his "working library" without a clear connecting phrase.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about linen being cut on the bias, while illustrative, feels somewhat tangential and could be more smoothly integrated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
