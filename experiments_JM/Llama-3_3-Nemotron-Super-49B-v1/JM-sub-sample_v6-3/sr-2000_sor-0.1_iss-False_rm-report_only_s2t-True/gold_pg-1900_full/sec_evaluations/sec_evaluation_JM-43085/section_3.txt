Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "sacerdotal sovereignty", "paradox", "amplitude") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Underlying this whole matter...") may require re-reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The argument regarding Meissonier's canvas size could benefit from clearer transitions between contrasting viewpoints.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of Meissonier and his context, potentially confusing unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
