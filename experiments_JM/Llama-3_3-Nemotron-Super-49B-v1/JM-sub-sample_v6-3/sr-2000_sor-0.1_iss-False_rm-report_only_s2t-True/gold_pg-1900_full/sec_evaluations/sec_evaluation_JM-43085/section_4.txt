Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic expressions (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst" and "apropos" are) and overly formal language might reduce accessibility for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Meissonier's response to critics and the detailed analysis of his works (e.g., from "Fortunately for him..." to the in-depth "The Game of Chess" success).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of the art world and specific historical figures (e.g., Th√©ophile Gautier, Jules Chenavard) without introduction might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
