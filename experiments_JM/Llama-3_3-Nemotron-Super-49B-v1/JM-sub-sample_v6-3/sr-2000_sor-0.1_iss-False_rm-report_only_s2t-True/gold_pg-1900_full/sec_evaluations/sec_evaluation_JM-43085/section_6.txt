Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mephistophelian", "literal-minded") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Emperor's sitting to the artist's later life events without a clear connecting phrase.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of the subjects (e.g., Meissonier, historical events) which might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
