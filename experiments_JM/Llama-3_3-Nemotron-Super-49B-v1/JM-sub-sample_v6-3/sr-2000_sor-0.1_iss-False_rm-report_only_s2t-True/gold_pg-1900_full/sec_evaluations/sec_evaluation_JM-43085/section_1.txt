Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "phalanx") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic approach to his birth and early life could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote's connection to the broader theme of respecting reality is clear, but subsequent paragraphs introduce multiple artists and styles without explicitly tying them back to Meissonier's unique approach until later.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
