Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "recondite", "esoteric") might challenge general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Arthur Davis to the broader topic of Hebrew's revival without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The comparison between Germanism and Judaism, while intriguing, could be more clearly introduced to enhance coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
