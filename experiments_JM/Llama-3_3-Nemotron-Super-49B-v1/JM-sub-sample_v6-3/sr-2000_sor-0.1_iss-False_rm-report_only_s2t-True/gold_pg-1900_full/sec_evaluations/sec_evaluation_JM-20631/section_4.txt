Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "invidiously", "centripetal", "dynast") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraph transitions could be smoother to enhance the flow between different biblical and historical references.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are densely packed with ideas, potentially reducing immediate clarity for readers not deeply familiar with the subject matter.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
