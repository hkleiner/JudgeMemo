Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Utilization of highly specialized vocabulary (e.g., "heteropathic laws", "emergent properties") could hinder comprehension for non-experts.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional lack of clarity due to long, nested clauses.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with referenced authors' works (e.g., Spencer, Mill, Lewes) without sufficient context.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing scientific principles and philosophical implications (e.g., the role of the "Source").
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs conflate multiple, distinct ideas without clear segmentation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
