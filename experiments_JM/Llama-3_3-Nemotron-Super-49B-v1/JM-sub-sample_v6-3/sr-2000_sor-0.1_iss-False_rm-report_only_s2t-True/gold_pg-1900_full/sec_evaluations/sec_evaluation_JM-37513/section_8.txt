Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "In virtue of its 'inheritance from the past', it would continue at uniform velocity in one direction.")
- [LEXICON] Use of overly technical or obscure vocabulary without clear explanation (e.g., "heredity-relatedness", "gravitative knowledge")
- [CLARITY] Frequent ambiguity in sentence meaning due to poor wording (e.g., "Awareness of what?")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions not fully supported by preceding text (e.g., introduction of "cognition in the usual acceptation" without clear link)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing physiological and cognitive processes without smooth transitions
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or signaling of topic shifts (e.g., moving from "gravitative knowledge" to "cognition")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
