Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several instances (e.g., "It is imperative that our thought of relations should have a concrete backing.")
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ex hypothesi", "superorganic") without clear necessity
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few places (not critically impacting understanding)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with Spencer's work without sufficient context
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing "ground" and introducing the need for analyzing types of relatedness
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., distinction between "Source", "ground", and "condition") without concrete examples to aid understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
