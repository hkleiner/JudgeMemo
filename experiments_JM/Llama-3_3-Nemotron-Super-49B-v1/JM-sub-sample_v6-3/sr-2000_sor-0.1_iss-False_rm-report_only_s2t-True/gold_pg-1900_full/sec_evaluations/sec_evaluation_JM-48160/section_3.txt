Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "However, there was still the morrow and Bar-le-Duc.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "turpentine", "oeuvre", "carnet rouge") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between present actions and reflective asides (e.g., transitioning from hotel experiences to broader war observations) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., "the war zone", "Verdun") and French terms without explanation may confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
