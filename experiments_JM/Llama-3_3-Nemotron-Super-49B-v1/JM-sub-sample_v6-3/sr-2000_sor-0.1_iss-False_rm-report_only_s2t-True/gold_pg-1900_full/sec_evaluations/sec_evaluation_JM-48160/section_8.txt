Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "gamin", "teutonically") might require additional processing for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing newsboys to the story about Major C. and later to the document analysis, potentially disrupting narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] The document from the Germans, while contextual, is lengthy and its integration could be smoother for enhanced coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
