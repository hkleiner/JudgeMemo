Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I believe it was early in 1914 that some German General said the war would be won by the stoutest nerves.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mitrailleuses", "carnet rouge", "poilus") might require explanation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing the train journey to analyzing French soldiers' nerves without a clear connecting phrase.
- [CLARITY] The narrative occasionally assumes prior knowledge (e.g., the significance of '70, the context of the war zone's layout).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
