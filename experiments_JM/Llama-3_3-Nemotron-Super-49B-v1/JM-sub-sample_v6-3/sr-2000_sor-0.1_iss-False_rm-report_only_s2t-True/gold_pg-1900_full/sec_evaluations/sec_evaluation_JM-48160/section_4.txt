Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is not my purpose to describe the hospitals here...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance accessibility for all readers (e.g., "taube", "camions" without immediate context).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing the hospital visit and the drive within the city limits.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" without brief explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
