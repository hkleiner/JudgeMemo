Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If I were taken to the front and given the hospitality of a trench I am positive that the guns for some inscrutable reason would be paralyzed.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "réformé", "taubes") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative of the trip and the reflective comment on being a "mascot" (could benefit from smoother connection).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the war context and locations (e.g., "the war zone", "Révigny, Nancy and Remiramont") without brief elaboration for unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
