Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "However—to return to the war zone.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sauf conduit", "immatriculation") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow with abrupt transitions between personal anecdotes and descriptive sections
- [CLARITY] Overly specific, unexplained references (e.g., "Le Bienêtre du Blessé") assume prior knowledge
