Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "One of them was retained by the Lodge and now occupies a prominent place in the East, there to remain for all time to come, never to be used again except it be by the President of the United States, the governor of Texas, or the Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "Estered Apprentice", "Fellow Craft")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "in the city of Houston on February, 1838" (missing day, though not crucial for understanding)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Masonic Lodge to introducing "Texasâ€™ Monument to a Great Empresario" without a clear connecting theme
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of locations and figures (e.g., Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College, Thomas J. Rusk) without brief contextualization
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between chapters, disrupting the flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
