Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "paroxysm of panic", "thoroughly") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and the list of founded towns without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain historical figures/events (e.g., "the Fredonian rebellion") without brief context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
