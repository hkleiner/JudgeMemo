Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] None detected in the current segment.
- [GRAMMAR] None detected in the current segment.
- [SYNTAX] Minor issue with repetitive sentence structure (e.g., "Marked by the State of Texas" repeated without variation).
- [LEXICON] Some terms (e.g., "Tejas Indians") might be unfamiliar to non-specialist readers without additional context.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between different types of historical sites (universities, homes, streets, highways) without a clear thematic or geographical transition.
- [CLARITY] Assuming the reader is familiar with the geographical layout of Nacogdoches; otherwise, the text might be confusing.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of "CHAPTER" headings within the segment disrupts the flow, suggesting a larger, unprovided context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
