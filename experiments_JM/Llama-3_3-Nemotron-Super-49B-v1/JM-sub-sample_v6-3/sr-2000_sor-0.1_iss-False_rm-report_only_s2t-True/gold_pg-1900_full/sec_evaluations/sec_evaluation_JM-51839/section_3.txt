Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "beneficient" should be "beneficent"
- [LEXICON] "wildest disorder" is somewhat clichéd, but not significantly impactful
- [SYNTAX] A few long sentences could be broken up for better flow (e.g., the first paragraph under "The Battle of Nacogdoches")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the aftermath of the Fredonian War to introducing Bustamente’s Law without clear chronological connection
- [CLARITY] The role of Stephen F. Austin in resolving the conflict after the Fredonian War could be more clearly explained
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Battle of Nacogdoches to "Growth of American Influence" could be smoother with a transitional sentence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
