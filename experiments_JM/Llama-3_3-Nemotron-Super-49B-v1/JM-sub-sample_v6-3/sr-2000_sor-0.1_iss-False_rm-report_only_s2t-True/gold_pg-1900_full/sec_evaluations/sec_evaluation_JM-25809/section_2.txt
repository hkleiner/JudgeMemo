Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "What! Bend those mighty rods of steel to his will? Twist and shape those others? Cast those great drivers? And after, to drive the monster with a hand?") 
  - [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for all audiences (e.g., "Ã¦sthetic", "hull bone", "ertop")

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Jim's awe at the train to focusing on the immigrant car and then to the boy's situation without clear transitional phrases.
  - [CLARITY] The boy's situation and dialogue, while impactful, introduce elements (e.g., the nature of his fear, the "ol' man") without full context, potentially confusing readers.

3. FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
