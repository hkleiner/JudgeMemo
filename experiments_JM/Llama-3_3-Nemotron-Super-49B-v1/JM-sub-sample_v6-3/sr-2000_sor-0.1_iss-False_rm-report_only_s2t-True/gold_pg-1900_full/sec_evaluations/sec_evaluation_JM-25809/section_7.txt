Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was as if the dirt were very soft, and not the striker very strong.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or colloquial expressions might confuse modern readers (e.g., "Bime-by", "yer", "ol' beggar")
- [SPELLING/DIALECT] Consistent use of dialect ("Ches" dialogue) could affect readability for some

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the intense tunnel work description to the leisurely hunting trip
- [CLARITY] The shift in Jim's hunting approach (from shooting to catching) could be more smoothly explained
- [LOGIC] The hunting scenario's prolonged setup versus its brief, chaotic conclusion might feel unbalanced to some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
