Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "t'ree", "dere", "cuddent", "kin" (informal spellings may affect readability for some readers)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial expressions (e.g., "hell-a-whooping", "pore little cuss") might limit clarity for non-regional readers
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and complex, potentially hindering smooth reading (e.g., the description of the wagon's journey)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ches' fall to the captain's immediate response and actions (lacks a clear connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] The shift in focus from the rescue urgency to the captain's joking about pants, while understandable for character development, slightly disrupts the tense atmosphere
- [LOGIC] The captain's decision to "timber" despite Bud's urgency is justified but could be more clearly explained to maintain coherence for all readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
