Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted (e.g., "Jim thought quick and hard, with chills and fever coursing over him ad libitum.")
- [LEXICON] Informal language and slang (e.g., "ginnies", "t'umpers") may hinder readability for some readers
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistency in dialect representation (e.g., "dis" vs. "this" in different contexts)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from singing to discovering a mountain lion feels abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The section could benefit from clearer transitions between distinct scenes (e.g., from night to morning, from singing to the lion encounter)
- [CLARITY] The purpose of including the detailed song lyrics is not entirely clear in advancing the plot or character development

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
