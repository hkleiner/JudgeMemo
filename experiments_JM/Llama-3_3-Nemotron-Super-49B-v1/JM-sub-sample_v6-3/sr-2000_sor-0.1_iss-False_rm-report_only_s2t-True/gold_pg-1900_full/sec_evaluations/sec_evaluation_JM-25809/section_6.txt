Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Informal dialect ("youse", "dat", "t'rough") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures (e.g., "His heart in turn rose with a home feeling; his belief...") could improve with simpler punctuation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from emotional intensity ("sudden sob") to lightheartedness ("Shake hands, pardner") without clear bridging.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the Gun" without introduction or context within this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
