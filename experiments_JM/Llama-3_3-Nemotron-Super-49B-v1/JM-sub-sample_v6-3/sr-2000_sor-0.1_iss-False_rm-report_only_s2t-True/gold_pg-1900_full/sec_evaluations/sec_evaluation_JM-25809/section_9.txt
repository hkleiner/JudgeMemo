Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was passing" and "came" in close proximity)
- [LEXICON] Informal language may detract from overall polish (e.g., "yaller bone-heap", "git me wits tergedder")
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spellings for dialect (e.g., "tergedder", "dat's") - while stylistic, may impact readability for some

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from humorous mail route story to serious mine collapse without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or long, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the description of Ches's journey through the tunnel)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
