Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "It was some little time the next morning before he could realize what he was doing out there under the tree.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "graver", "sojering")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the deer fight scene to the serious conversation about Ches' father without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The sentence "A good incident is an opal among gems in a lonely life." feels somewhat disconnected from the surrounding narrative
- [LOGIC] The shift in tone from the intense physical confrontation to the reflective, serious dialogue feels somewhat jarring

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
