Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "purplish and cottony", "innumerable tasks") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the Imperial Court visit to the Universal Exposition of 1867 without clear contextual link.
- [CLARITY] The parenthetical section about the art school, while informative, disrupts the narrative flow of Rosa Bonheur's life events.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
