Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "the concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity").
- [LEXICON] Formal vocabulary ("prostrated", "panegyric", "innumerable") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the artist's expected long old age to her sudden death.
- [CLARITY] Assumption that readers are familiar with the significance of PÃ¨re-Lachaise cemetery and the Salon.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
