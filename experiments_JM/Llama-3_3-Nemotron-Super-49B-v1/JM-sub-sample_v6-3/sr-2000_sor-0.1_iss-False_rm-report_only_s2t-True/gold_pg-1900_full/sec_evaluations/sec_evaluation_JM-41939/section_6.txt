Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic terms (e.g., "exigencies", "saluting the rising orb of day") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between different time periods and topics (artistic work, personal loss, awards) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from discussing animal paintings to the death of Mlle. Micas and its aftermath might slightly disrupt the narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
