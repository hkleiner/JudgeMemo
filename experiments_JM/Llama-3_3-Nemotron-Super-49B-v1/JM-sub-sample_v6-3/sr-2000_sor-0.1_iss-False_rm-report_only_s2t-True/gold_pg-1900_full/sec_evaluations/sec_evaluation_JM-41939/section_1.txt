Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "irksome task", "bespattered", "comrades") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Rosa's childhood activities to her later, more focused artistic pursuits without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The introduction of multiple family members and friends (e.g., Silvela, Mlle. Micas, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire) without clear relevance to Rosa's development could slightly confuse the focus.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
