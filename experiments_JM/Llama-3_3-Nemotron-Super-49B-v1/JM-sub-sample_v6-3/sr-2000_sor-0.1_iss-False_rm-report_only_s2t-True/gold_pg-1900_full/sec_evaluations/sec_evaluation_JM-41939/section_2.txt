Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "destined to continue throughout her entire life") might slightly affect modern readability.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between artistic development and personal life without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of 19th-century art world context (e.g., Salon, jury dynamics) might confuse uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
