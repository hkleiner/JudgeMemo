Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of Aunt Hitty's feelings and plans)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "cabined, cribbed, confined")
- [LENGTH] Extremely long paragraphs may disrupt flow for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical musings about Anthony Croft to the narrative about Mrs. Butterfield's death
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about character backgrounds and relationships (e.g., Aunt Hitty's husband "Si") without clear introduction
- [FOCUS] Tangential details (e.g., the specifics of coffin-plates) might slightly detract from the main narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
