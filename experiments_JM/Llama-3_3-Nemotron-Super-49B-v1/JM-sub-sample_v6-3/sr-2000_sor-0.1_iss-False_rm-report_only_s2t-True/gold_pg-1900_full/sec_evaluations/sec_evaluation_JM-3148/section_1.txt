Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "liebling", "degraded") might require additional processing time for less experienced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the present scene and Anthony Croft's backstory without a clear transitional device.
- [CLARITY] The depth of emotional and thematic connections (e.g., the violin's significance) assumes a level of contextual understanding that might not be immediately clear to all readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
