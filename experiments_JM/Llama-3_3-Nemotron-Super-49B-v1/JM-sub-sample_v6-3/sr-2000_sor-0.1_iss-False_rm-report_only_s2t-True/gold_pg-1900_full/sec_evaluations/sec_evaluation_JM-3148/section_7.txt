Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Her heart was divided between a great throb of pity and sympathy for him and an irresistible sense of gratitude for herself.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more concise for smoother flow (e.g., "mendacious word" might be less common, potentially slowing reading)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic reflection to practical conversation without clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The character's emotional shift and backstory (e.g., Lyddy's past experiences) could be more seamlessly integrated for immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
