Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic or less common terms (e.g., "sapolio", "sightless ones") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Anthony's introspection to the detailed description of Lyddy's sitting-room feels somewhat abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different times of day without clear transitional markers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
