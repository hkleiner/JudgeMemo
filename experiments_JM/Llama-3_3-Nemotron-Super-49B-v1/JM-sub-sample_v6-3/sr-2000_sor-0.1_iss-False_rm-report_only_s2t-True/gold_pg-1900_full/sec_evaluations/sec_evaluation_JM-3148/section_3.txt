Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "wherewithal") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the descriptive passage on Anthony's wood collection and the poem about Stradivarius, slightly disrupting the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] The depth of Anthony's understanding and his poetic explanation might seem unexpectedly sophisticated for his described background, potentially causing narrative disbelief for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
