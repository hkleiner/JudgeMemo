Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "scabrous", "muck-rake", "Pantisocracy") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between discussing Tennyson's work, Victorian era context, and broader philosophical themes could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of referenced works (e.g., "The Faerie Queene", "Paradise Lost", specific Tennyson poems) might lead to disconnection for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
