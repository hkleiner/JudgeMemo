Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "solatium", "potations", "intemperance") might require additional context or lookup for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between discussing different aspects of Victorian society (e.g., from Law to Universities to Civil Service) without clear connecting phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., Lecky, Bradlaugh case, Disraeli's scheme) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
