Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "vehemence was in fashion", "brackish quality") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between discussing social conditions, literary figures, and philosophical critiques without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures (e.g., Carlyle, Ruskin, Plato) and their works without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
