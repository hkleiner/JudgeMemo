Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long descriptive sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "swaddling clothes", "rompers") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical industry context and personal narrative segments.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Gibson Girl, specific authors/artists) without introduction.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
