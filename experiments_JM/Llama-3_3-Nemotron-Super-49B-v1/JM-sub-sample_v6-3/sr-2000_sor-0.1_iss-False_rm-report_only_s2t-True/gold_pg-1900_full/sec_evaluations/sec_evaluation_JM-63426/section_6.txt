Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, complex sentences (e.g., the first sentence of the "Interlude in New York" chapter)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language and phrases (e.g., "Glad era", "Vandyke", "cravat tied in a flowing bowknot") may hinder readability for modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense (e.g., switching between past and present in descriptive sections)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the Wayside Press narrative to the "Interlude in New York" chapter without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sections are overly descriptive, potentially distracting from the main narrative flow (e.g., detailed description of the protagonist's attire)
- [LOGIC] The shift in tone from somber (reflecting on the demise of Wayside Press) to whimsical (the meeting with Mr. Davis and its aftermath) feels somewhat disjointed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
