Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "corn-fed American", "pi") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Bradley's impact to the personal, biographical narrative in "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" chapter.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical art movements and figures without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers.
