Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, nested sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "You tell him about your father and that you are going back to Boston to study art. He suggests your stopping off in Chicago to see him. Says he can perhaps help you.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "devil" in printing context, "tint-cutting") might require additional context for full understanding by modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense (mostly past, with a brief, unclear shift in "You are now learning to engrave tints on wood-blocks")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of the "Current Segment" and the start of "FIRST SOJOURN IN CHICAGO" without clear temporal or contextual bridge.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of printing and art terminology (e.g., "tint-cutting", "wood-engravers") without explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of new characters (e.g., Mr. Rand, Mr. McNally, Mr. Robinson) without detailed context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
