Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, long sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic terms (e.g., "whiskers known as mutton-chops", "shoddy") might require clarification for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different time periods and topics (e.g., from the foundry incident to the description of the snowstorm).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., specific printing technologies, historical figures like Lillian Russell) without explanation.
