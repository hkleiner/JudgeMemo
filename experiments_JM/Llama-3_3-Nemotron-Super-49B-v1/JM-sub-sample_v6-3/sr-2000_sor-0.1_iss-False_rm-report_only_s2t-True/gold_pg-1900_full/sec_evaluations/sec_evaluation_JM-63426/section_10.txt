Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "dreary condition", "floriated border") might slow reading for non-specialists.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical, project, and award details without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are dense with names and projects, making it hard to discern the main point without close attention.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
