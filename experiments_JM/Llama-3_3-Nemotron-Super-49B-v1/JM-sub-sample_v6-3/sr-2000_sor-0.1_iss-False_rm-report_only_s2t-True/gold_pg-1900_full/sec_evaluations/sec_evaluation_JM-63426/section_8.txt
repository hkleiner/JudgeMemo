Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long, nested descriptions).
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or specialized terminology (e.g., "typographic make-up", " ATF composing room") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different projects/time periods (e.g., shifting from Metropolitan to Hearst projects without clear chronological markers).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of the industry and figures (e.g., expectations around "Vanity" initial letters, Benda's style) without introduction.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
