Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "betwixt", "thou") and overly formal tone might hinder readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Brueghel's influence to Millet's personal life and artistic development without a clear connecting phrase.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph on "The Angelus" assumes prior knowledge of the artwork's context and criticisms, potentially confusing unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
