Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was, therefore, a hard struggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going on around him.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sylvan", "sough", "sylvan" not present but "strenuous" and "sough" like words are) could slightly hinder readability for non-native or younger readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing artistic movement to Millet's personal life without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of the art historical context (e.g., the significance of the shift towards naturalistic art) without brief elaboration.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
