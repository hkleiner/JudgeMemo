Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "to-morrow") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing "La Baigneuse" to the statement "Millet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter" could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between analyzing specific artworks, making broad statements about Millet, and then introducing a new chapter without a clear connector.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
