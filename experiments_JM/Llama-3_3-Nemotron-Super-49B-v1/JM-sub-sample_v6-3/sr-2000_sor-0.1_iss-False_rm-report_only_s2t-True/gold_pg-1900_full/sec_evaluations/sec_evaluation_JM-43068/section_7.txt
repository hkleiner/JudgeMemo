Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense sentence structures (e.g., "The revolting brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the imagination. Is it possible that fellow-creatures so utterly debased by toil and neglect exist? Millet dispels any doubt upon the question by bequeathing to humanity this trenchant portrait.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "quasi-classic", "ineffusion", "incomprehensible mingling")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from biographical narrative to thematic analysis (between paragraphs discussing Millet's life and the "MAN AND HIS ART" chapter)
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about art movements and specific artworks without brief context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
