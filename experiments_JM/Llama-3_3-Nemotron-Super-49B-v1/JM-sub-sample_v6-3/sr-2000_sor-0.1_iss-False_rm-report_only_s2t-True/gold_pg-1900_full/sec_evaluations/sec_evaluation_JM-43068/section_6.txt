Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "pecuniary") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical, artistic, and financial aspects without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of the artists and their works (e.g., the significance of "The Angelus") could affect understanding.
