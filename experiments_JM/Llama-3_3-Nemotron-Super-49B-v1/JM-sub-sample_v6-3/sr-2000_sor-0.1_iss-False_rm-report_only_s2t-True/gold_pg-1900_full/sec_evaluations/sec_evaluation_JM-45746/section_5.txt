Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some vocabulary (e.g., "cordial greeting", "co√∂perative spirit") might be less familiar to non-native speakers or younger readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing school activities to the chapter about the janitor without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about the manufacturing establishment, while illustrative, slightly delays the introduction of the janitor's role in the school context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
