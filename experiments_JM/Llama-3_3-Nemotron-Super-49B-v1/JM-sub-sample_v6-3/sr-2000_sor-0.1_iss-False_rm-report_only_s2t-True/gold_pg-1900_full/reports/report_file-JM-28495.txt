        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase deliberations, and the quest for the Lost Dogs' Home, which, while mostly coherent, might slightly disorient some readers due to the breadth of topics.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The transition from discussing dog breeds to following the Battersea Home official could be slightly smoother for enhanced flow.

  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was quite impossible, too, short of locking him up, to prevent him from accompanying us when we took our walks abroad, if he had made up his mind to do so.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "perambulators", "détour", "patrician calm") might require additional processing for modern readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:

    - [CLARITY]:
        • The abrupt reveal of "Excalibur's bone" feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding dinner party description, though it is a pivotal comedic moment.

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:

  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "coram populo", "bunker" in this context) might require additional processing for less familiar readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The abrupt shift from Excalibur's adventures to the curate and Eileen's serious conversation feels somewhat disconnected without clearer transitional context.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between Excalibur's perspective and the humans' dialogue without a seamless bridge, potentially jarring some readers.

Section section_06 (Chars 41196–49577):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward sentence structure in "He was going to visit friends in the north. Aren't you, darling?" (informal tag in formal context)
    - [LEXICON]:

    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Missing article in "Eileen took him up to London by train" (could imply "by train" is the primary mode, but not entirely clear without context)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Excalibur's journey to the coroner's jury section (CHAPTER VII starts abruptly without clear connection)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear motivation behind Eileen's demonstrative behavior towards Excalibur vs. the curate (needs more contextual buildup)
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Excalibur's sudden understanding and pursuit of the taxi feels slightly implausible without more emotional setup

  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "bouleversement", "corroborative")
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had been brought" to "was hauled" without clear temporal progression)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden, unannounced shift from the train accident to Lord Caversham's encounter with Excalibur (lacks transitional element)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The character "Excalibur" is introduced without immediate context for new readers (assuming this segment is read in isolation)
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The swift resolution and convenient timing of events (e.g., the doctor's immediate presence, the swift extraction of the commercial traveler) may strain believability

        • Sudden introduction of "Excalibur" without prior context (within this segment), assuming external knowledge.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt shift from dialogue to descriptive narrative ("Its tongue lolled..."), though effective, slightly jarring.
