Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the subject had ceased to interest her" (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in dialogue may feel slightly anachronistic or less natural for some readers (e.g., "Dost hear?", "Wilt thou obey?")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Debby's thoughts about her father to hating the King without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in "Bits of strange talk... came to her now" (could clarify what "those long hours" specifically refer to for better clarity)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
