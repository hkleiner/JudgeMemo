Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "As I am more susceptible to manners than to anything in the world...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "mitrailleuses", "horizon blue") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing war scenes to the narrator's trip planning and observations at the station.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between different time frames and locations without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
