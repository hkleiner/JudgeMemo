Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "However—to return to the war zone.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sauf conduit", "permis de séjour", "immatriculation") without immediate context for general readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear narrative need)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow with abrupt transitions between personal anecdotes and descriptive sections
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., significance of the Marne, the Somme, and specific locations without brief explanation)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, particularly when shifting from personal struggle to descriptive scenes
