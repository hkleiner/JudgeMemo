Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "bewildered", "commassary", "perils") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing "The Old Stone Fort" to introducing Gil Ybarbo's governance role without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the investigation and its aftermath could benefit from clearer temporal sequencing and connections to the broader narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
