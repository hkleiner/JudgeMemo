Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "ravine", "aide-de-camp") might slow some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing infrastructure to introducing the Battle of Petersburg without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The shift in focus (e.g., from fortifications to raids to the Battle of Petersburg) could be more seamlessly integrated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
