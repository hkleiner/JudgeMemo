Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "enthroned", "argosy", "brazen autocracy") might slow comprehension for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from critiquing biblical passages to comparing with modern sentiments (e.g., the Englishwoman's statement) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The argument against judging the Bible outside its historic conditions could be more directly connected to the preceding biblical examples for enhanced coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
