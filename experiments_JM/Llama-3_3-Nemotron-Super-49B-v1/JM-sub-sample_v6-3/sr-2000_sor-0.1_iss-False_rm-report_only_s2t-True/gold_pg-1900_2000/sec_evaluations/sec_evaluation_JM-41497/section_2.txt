Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "comportment", "Lion Comique") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Reynolds' success to generalizing about artists' personalities without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph contrasting Reynolds' flaws with his associations could benefit from clearer linking to the overall narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
