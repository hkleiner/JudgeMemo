Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "nail him!" (informal, yet contextually fitting, but slightly jarring)
- [LEXICON] Colloquialisms ("bet cher life", "sonny") may reduce readability for some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of exclamation marks in dialogue, slightly affecting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Bud's robbery story to discussing the burro without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of characters' past interactions (e.g., favors done for the humpbacked man) without context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
