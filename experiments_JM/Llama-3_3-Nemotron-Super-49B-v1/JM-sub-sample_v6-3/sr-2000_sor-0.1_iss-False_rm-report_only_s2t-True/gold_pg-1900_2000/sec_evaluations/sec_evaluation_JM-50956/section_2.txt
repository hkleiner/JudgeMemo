Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "sanguine World struggle", "stoope to employ") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the immediate war tactics and the later historical recognition of Russia's role could be more seamless.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes a level of prior knowledge about the war's specifics (e.g., the significance of the Marne, the role of Ludendorff) that might not be universally held among all readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
