Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It is graduation day... You are six years old; next month you will be seven.") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "corn-fed", "pi", "picklelime") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the introductory chapter and "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" without a clear connecting sentence or paragraph
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., Kelmscott House, specific artists) without brief explanation may confuse some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
