Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "For at the spring holidays...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly formal or less common in modern writing (e.g., "squandered your valuable time", "bowed out").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Kuei Ping's memories to the present with Madame Yen (could benefit from a smoother transition).
- [CLARITY] The conflict's emotional depth is clear, but the swift decision-making process feels somewhat rushed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
