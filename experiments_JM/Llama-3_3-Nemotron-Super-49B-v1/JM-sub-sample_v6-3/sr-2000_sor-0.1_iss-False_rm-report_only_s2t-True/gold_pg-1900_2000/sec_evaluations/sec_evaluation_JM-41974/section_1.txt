Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "rainless", "Musselman", "Quay of the Slaves") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing Veronese's artistic style to his biography feels somewhat abrupt.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of 16th-century Venice and its artists might leave some readers disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
