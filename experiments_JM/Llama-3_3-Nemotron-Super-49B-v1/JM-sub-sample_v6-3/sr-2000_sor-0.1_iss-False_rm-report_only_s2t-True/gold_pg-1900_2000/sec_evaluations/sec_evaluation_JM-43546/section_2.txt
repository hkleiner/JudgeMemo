Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the last paragraph about naming the puppy)
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "Donald" (could vary with "Don" for flow)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "for they could keep up with him on a day's climb over the moors" (could be more smoothly integrated)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Uncle Alan's home to the story about the puppy
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "doggie's" introduction without context in this segment
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between paragraphs (e.g., from planning the week to describing Uncle Alan's backstory)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
