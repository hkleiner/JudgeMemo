Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., Donald's explanation to Sandy)
- [LEXICON] Some potentially unfamiliar terms for non-Scotch readers (e.g., "wee bairn", "bairn" itself, though context helps)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from puppy story to detailed description of Scottish tea and foods (though thematically connected, the transition is sudden)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Scotch customs and Uncle Alan without full context in this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
