Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling added no little to the discomfort of the situation").
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "disagreeableness", "intra muros") might affect readability for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing personal discomfort to historical and descriptive narrative about Manila without a clear connecting sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between different topics (personal experience, historical context, observational description) without a strong cohesive link.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
