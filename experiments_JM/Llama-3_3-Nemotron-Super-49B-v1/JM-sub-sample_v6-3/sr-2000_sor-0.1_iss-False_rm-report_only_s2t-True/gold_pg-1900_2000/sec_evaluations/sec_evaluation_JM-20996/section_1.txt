Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was on this day...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "beheld", "wonted devotion", "beheld") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the ship's departure to the detailed touristic description of Honolulu without clear narrative link.
- [CLARITY] The inclusion of the Century Magazine reference feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate narrative context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
