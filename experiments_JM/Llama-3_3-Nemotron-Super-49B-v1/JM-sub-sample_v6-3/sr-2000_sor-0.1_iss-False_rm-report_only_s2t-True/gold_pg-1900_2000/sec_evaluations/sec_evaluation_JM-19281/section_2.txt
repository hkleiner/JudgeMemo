Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustible", "irreconcilable", "antipathies") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between discussing religious revival, personal identity quests, and critiques of materialism without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The analogy of Majnún and Laylí, while poetic, might confuse readers unfamiliar with the tale, disrupting the flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
