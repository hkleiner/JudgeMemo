Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat formal and less common vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustible public appetite", "irreconcilable religious antipathies") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the Bahá'í initiative to the broader historical and philosophical context could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it hard to discern the primary point without close reading.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
