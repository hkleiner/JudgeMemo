Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It will perhaps be said...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suppleness", "nonconformist", "encephalon" not present but "suppleness" is in context, however "strenuously" and "honoured" are in the current segment)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptive statements without clear evidence ("It will perhaps be said...", "Did he not himself provide...") 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's later years to analyzing the scope of his philosophy 
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient elaboration for clarity (e.g., the explanation of "the Unknowable" and "Ultimate Reality")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
