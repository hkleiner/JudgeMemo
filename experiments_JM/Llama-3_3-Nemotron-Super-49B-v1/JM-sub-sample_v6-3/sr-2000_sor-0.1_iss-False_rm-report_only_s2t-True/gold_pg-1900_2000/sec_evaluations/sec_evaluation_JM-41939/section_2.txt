Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense sentence structures (e.g., "Whatever gifts he may be endowed with by nature, talent cannot be improvised; it is the fruit of independent and sustained toil.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dolman", "frogs", "Rue Rumford") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing artistic principles to changing residences (could benefit from a smoother link).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of "line-work" and its impact without brief elaboration for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
