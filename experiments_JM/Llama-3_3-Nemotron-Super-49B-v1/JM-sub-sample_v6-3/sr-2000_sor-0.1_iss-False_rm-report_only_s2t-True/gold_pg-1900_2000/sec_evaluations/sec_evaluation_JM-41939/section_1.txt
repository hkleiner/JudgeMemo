Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "irksome task", "relinquish his dreams of glory") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Rosa's childhood activities to her placement in a dressmaker's and then to school, without smooth transitions.
- [CLARITY] The introduction of multiple family moves and historical events (e.g., the 1830 revolution, cholera outbreak) could benefit from clearer contextualization for their impact on Rosa's development.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
