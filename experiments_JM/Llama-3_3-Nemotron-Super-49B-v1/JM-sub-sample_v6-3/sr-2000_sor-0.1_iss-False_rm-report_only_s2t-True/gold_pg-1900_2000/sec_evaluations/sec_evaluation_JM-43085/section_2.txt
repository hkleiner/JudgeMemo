Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "damnatory", "exorbitant", "unlooked-for") might challenge casual readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumps between different periods of Meissonier's life without clear transitional markers)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., Napoleonic Epic, specific artists) without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
