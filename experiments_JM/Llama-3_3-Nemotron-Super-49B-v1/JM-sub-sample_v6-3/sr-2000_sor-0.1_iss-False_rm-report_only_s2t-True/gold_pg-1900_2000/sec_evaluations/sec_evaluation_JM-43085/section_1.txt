Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "phalanx") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to his birth and early life could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote's connection to the broader narrative of Meissonier's life and artistic philosophy, while present, could be more explicitly stated for enhanced clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
