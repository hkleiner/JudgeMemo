Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, though stylistic, may slightly impede reading flow for some)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices (e.g., "planetarithed", "ecth-captain") might confuse readers unfamiliar with the futuristic context
- [SYNTAX] Minor sentence structure complexity in a few places (e.g., "He was a big man even by Earth standards, which meant he towered over the Irwadian's green, scaly head.") could slightly hinder smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation, potentially confusing readers
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the spaceport scene to Ramsey's conversation with Stu Englander feels somewhat disconnected without a clearer temporal or spatial bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
