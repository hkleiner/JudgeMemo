  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "aromacular", "quasi-biological", "sinewy suppleness") might challenge casual readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical explanation, and academic critique without clear transitional markers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed knowledge of Spencer's works and 19th-century scientific context may leave some readers disconnected from the narrative's flow.

Section section_02 (Chars 9138–12774):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It will perhaps be said...")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suppleness", "nonconformist", "encephalon" not present but "suppleness" is in context, however "strenuously" and "honoured" are in the current segment)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Assumptive statements without clear evidence ("It will perhaps be said...", "Did he not himself provide...")
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's later years to analyzing the scope of his philosophy
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Overly abstract concepts without sufficient elaboration for clarity (e.g., the explanation of "the Unknowable" and "Ultimate Reality")
