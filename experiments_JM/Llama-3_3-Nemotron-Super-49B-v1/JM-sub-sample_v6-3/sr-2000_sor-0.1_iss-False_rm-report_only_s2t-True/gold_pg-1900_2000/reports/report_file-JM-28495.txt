        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional cognitive effort for less literate readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase discussions, and the pursuit in London, which, while mostly coherent, might slightly disorient some readers due to its episodic nature.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The transition from discussing dog breeds to following the Battersea Home official could be slightly smoother for enhanced flow.
