  Fluency Issues:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "passively quiet", "lend light" might confuse some readers)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
