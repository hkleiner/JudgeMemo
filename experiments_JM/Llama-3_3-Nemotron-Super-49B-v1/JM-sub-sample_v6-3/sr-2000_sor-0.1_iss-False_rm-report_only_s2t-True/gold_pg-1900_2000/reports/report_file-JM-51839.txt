  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, poetic language may impede smooth reading flow (e.g., "the dint of hoof, the print of booted heel, / Like prick of spurs—the shadows that they cast.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "spilled wine and scattered musk") might require additional interpretation for some readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from poetic verse to historical narrative without clear connective tissue.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed prior knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., De Soto, LaSalle, Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

        • Abrupt transition from discussing "The Old Stone Fort" to introducing Gil Ybarbo's governance role without a clear connecting sentence.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The paragraph about the investigation and its aftermath could benefit from clearer temporal sequencing and connections to the broader narrative.
