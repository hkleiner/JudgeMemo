  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "phalanx") might require additional interpretation.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to his birth and early life could be smoother.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The anecdote's connection to the broader narrative of Meissonier's life and artistic philosophy, while present, could be more explicitly stated for enhanced clarity.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–12899):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close.")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "damnatory", "exorbitant", "unlooked-for") might challenge casual readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Non-linear narrative flow (jumps between different periods of Meissonier's life without clear transitional markers)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., Napoleonic Epic, specific artists) without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers
