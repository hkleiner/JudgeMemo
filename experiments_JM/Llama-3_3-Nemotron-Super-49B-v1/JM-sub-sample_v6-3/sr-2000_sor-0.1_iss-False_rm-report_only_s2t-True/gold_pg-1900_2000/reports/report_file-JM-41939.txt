  Fluency Issues:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "irksome task", "relinquish his dreams of glory") might require additional processing for modern readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps abruptly from Rosa's childhood activities to her placement in a dressmaker's and then to school, without smooth transitions.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The introduction of multiple family moves and historical events (e.g., the 1830 revolution, cholera outbreak) could benefit from clearer contextualization for their impact on Rosa's development.
