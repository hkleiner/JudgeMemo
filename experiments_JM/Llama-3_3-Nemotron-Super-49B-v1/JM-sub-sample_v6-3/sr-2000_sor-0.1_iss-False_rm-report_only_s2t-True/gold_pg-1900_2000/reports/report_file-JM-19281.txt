  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from discussing the Bahá'í initiative to the broader historical and philosophical context could be smoother.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it hard to discern the primary point without close reading.
