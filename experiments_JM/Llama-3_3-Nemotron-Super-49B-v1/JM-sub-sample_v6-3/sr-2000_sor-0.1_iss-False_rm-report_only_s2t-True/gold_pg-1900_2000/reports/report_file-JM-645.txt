  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional cognitive effort for less familiar readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between past and present reflections without clear transitional markers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Character motivations (e.g., the narrator's true feelings about Vereker's work) and some plot points (e.g., the significance of Corvick's request) could be more explicitly stated for clarity.

Section section_02 (Chars 7852–11221):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:

    - [CLARITY]:
        • The character motivations (e.g., the narrator's expectation vs. Lady Jane's response) could be slightly more explicitly connected to enhance clarity.
