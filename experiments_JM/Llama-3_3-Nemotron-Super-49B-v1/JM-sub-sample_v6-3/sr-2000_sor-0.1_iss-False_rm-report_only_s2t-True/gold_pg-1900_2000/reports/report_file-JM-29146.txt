Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, though stylistic, may slightly impede reading flow for some)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some word choices (e.g., "planetarithed", "ecth-captain") might confuse readers unfamiliar with the futuristic context
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Minor sentence structure complexity in a few places (e.g., "He was a big man even by Earth standards, which meant he towered over the Irwadian's green, scaly head.") could slightly hinder smooth reading
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation, potentially confusing readers
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the spaceport scene to Ramsey's conversation with Stu Englander feels somewhat disconnected without a clearer temporal or spatial bridge

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–13232):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent but incorrect usage for Irwadian speech pattern, may distract)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "anthropologist friend", "be-jeweled straps") may slow reading for some readers
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, winding sentences (e.g., the final paragraph before the gambling hall scene) can disrupt flow
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from Ramsey's good deed to his gambling, lacking a clear connective tissue
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The Irwadian's sudden, intense hatred for Earthmen, while contextual, feels somewhat unprepared within this segment
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The silent, ominous reaction of the outworlder-filled hall feels slightly implausible given the setting's description
