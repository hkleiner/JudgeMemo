        • Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Transitions between historical periods and ideas could be more explicitly signposted.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical events (e.g., the impact of the French Revolution on England) might leave some readers disconnected.
