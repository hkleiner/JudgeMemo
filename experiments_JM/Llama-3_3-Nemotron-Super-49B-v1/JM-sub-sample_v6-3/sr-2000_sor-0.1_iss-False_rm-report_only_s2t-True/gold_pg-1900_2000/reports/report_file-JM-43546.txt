  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., Donald's explanation to Sandy)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some potentially unfamiliar terms for non-Scotch readers (e.g., "wee bairn", "bairn" itself, though context helps)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt shift from puppy story to detailed description of Scottish tea and foods (though thematically connected, the transition is sudden)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumption of prior knowledge about Scotch customs and Uncle Alan without full context in this segment

  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the last paragraph about naming the puppy)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Repetitive use of "Donald" (could vary with "Don" for flow)
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor: "for they could keep up with him on a day's climb over the moors" (could be more smoothly integrated)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing Uncle Alan's home to the story about the puppy
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumption of prior knowledge about "doggie's" introduction without context in this segment
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of clear connection between paragraphs (e.g., from planning the week to describing Uncle Alan's backstory)
