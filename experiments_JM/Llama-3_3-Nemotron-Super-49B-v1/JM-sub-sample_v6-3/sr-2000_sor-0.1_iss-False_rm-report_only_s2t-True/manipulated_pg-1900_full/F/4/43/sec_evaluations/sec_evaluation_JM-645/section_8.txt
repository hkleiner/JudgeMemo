Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "avidity", "touvaille", "connoisseur") might require additional effort for non-advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumping between past events and the present) could confuse readers without careful attention.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with multiple, interconnected ideas, potentially overwhelming the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
