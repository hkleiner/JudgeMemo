Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasionally dense, specialized vocabulary (e.g., "inextricably," "paradoxically") might challenge general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the universal acceptance of unity's importance could benefit from broader contextual support.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing global unity to the Bahá'í community's example, lacking a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
