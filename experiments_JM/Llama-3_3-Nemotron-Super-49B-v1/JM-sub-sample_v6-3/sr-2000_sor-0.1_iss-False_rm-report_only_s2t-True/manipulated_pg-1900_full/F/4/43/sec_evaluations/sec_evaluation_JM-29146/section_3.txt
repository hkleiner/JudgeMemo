Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "whithpered" (should be "whispered"), "elth" (should be "else"), "latht" (should be "last"), "n't The was" (incoherent phrase)
- [GRAMMAR] "I'm so afraid," she said. "What will I do? What can I do?" (repetitive, could be condensed for better flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of simplistic dialogue tags (e.g., "said", "demanded"); could benefit from more varied tags for better narrative flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of the Earthgirl without prior context or explanation within the evaluated segment
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the gambling hall scene to Ramsey's room without a clear temporal or spatial bridge
- [CLARITY] The Earthgirl's intentions and background are unclear, potentially confusing the reader

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
