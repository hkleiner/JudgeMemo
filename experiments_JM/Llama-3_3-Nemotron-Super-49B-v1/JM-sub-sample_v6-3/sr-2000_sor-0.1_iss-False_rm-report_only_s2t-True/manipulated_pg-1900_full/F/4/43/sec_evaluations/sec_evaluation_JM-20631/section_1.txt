Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It one more languages our than is, were dead or, revival the a interesting profoundly set fact direction been movements which on of foot that in age for in have dying."
- [LEXICON] Word choice in "savage sublimity" may not be the most precise for the intended meaning.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the created the of six and-by rate" (though this appears to be a typo or transcription error, assuming it's intended to say "the creation of six thousand years ago" or similar).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Arthur Davis's work to the concept of "Chosen People" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Judaism by timbrel on the even of, accompanied its Song Hate has Miriam." is unclear and seems to contain errors (likely a typo or transcription issue, e.g., possibly referring to Miriam's song after the Exodus).
- [STRUCTURE] The jump from historical examples of ritual languages to the revival of Hebrew feels slightly disconnected without a stronger transitional phrase.
