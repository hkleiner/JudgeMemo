Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, affecting flow.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "tewky") without immediate context.
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistency in "cheviot cloths" (should be "cheviot cloths" is correct, but "Harris tweeds" description is detailed, yet "tewky" spelling is unconventional and not defined until later).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Scotland's scenery to the birthday party preparations.
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps between different story elements (e.g., from "Auld Wullie" to the party preparations) without smooth transitions.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes prior knowledge of characters' relationships and some Scottish terms without full explanation within this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
