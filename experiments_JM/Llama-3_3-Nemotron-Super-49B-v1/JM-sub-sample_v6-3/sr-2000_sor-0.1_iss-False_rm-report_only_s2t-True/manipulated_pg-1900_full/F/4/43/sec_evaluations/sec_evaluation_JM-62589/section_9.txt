Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "How lonely it was! The and making trees wind among the bleak gaunt swept them moan creak."
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language in some passages (e.g., "the stillness was driving him mad!") may disrupt flow for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense in "Weaker and weaker he grew and as his mind cleared..." (consider "had cleared" for consistency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's focus on his mission to empathetically tending to Morley, though emotionally impactful, feels somewhat abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the intense duel scene to the reflective, slower-paced aftermath could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The character "Molly" is introduced without clear context in "Itâ€™s Molly!" - assuming "Molly" refers to Robert's nickname, clarification might enhance immediate understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
