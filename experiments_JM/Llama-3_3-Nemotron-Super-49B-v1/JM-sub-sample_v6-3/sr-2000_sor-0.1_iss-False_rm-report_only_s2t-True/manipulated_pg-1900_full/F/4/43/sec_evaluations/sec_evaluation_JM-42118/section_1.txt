Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "As the glovemaker looked out...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern audiences (e.g., "bewigged", "fopperies")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from detailed biographical/historical context to the abrupt, pivotal event ("like bolt from the blue") 
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense with historical/contextual information, potentially confusing the focus on the main subject

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
