Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It race is individuals a of."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "dissimilarity", "certain large cellar", "exquisite", "teutonically redundant")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "It race is individuals a of." (should be "This race is made up of individuals.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing newsboys to Major C.'s story without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between multiple unrelated topics (newsboys, Major C.'s story, the document, "Le Bienêtre du Blessé") without a clear overarching theme or transition.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of including the full text of the German document is not clearly integrated into the narrative's flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
