Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "sombre", "inasmuch", "patrimony").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor issue with punctuation consistency (e.g., missing Oxford comma in some lists).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing materialism's failures to introducing global integration without a clear transitional sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between various examples (e.g., from environmentalism to extraterrestrial sightings) without clear sectioning or transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, making it hard to discern the primary point without close reading.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
