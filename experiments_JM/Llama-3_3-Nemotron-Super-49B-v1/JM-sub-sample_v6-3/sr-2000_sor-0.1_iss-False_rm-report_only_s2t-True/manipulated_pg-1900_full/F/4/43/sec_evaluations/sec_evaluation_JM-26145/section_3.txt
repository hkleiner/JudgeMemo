1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "Pidati", "Shirtani") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Transitions between discussions of different kingdoms (e.g., from Babylon to Mitani) could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between historical narrative and analytical commentary without clear sectioning.
