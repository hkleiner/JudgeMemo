Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "unimpeded" (should be "unhindered" for better context, though not strictly incorrect)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in paragraphs may impede smooth reading for some readers
- [LEXICON] "wildest disorder" (somewhat archaic, might not be immediately clear to all readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing the aftermath of the Fredonian War to introducing Bustamenteâ€™s Law without clear contextual link
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., discussing 1830 events after the 1826 Fredonian War, then back to 1832) might confuse some readers
- [CLARITY] Overly assume prior knowledge of historical figures (e.g., Santa Anna, Bustamente) without brief introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
