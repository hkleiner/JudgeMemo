Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some vocabulary choices (e.g., "creditabe", "unprepared for a definite position") could be more precise or modern.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative of the author's entry into teaching and the introduction of the two contrasting young men.
- [CLARITY] The connection between the two young men's stories and the broader point about teaching as a job vs. profession could be more explicitly stated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
