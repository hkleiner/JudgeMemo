1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It small of the true able the they that whenever had defeat a superiority were is Germans equally Russians to even force."
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "will always remain" and similar phrases for emphasis, slightly reducing flow.
- [SPELLING] Minor typo in "It may seem strange that the Germans should have managed to have numerical superiority over the Russians all the time. Regrettable as it may be, it is nevertheless true, for the strength of an army is determined not by the number of its men, but by the number of bayonets (infantry), sabres (cavalry) and guns (artillery). The it guns for consisted and, had bayonets of millions Army of Russian only one-tenth its but number." ("The it" likely a typo)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russia's future power is inevitable without fully addressing the impact of Bolshevism's current state.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the past war to speculating about future geopolitical dynamics without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence in "Where will Russia be then? Not the present-day Russia bleeding to death in its struggle against Bolshevism, but the future, once more powerful, Russia?..." could be clearer.
