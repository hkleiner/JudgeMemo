Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "She has led me beneath the counting board...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance vividness for modern readers (e.g., "luminous light" is poetic but somewhat generic).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing natural/scenic elements to focusing on the school/church without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The purpose/significance of the "counting board" and its legend could be more explicitly explained for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
