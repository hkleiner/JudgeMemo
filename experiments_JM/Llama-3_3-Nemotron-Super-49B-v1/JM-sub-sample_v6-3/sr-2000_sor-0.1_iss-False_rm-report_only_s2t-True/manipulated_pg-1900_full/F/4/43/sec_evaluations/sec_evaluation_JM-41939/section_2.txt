Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "manias", "sustained toil", "physiognomies") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between artistic development, personal life, and external events (e.g., the Republic's decree) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of art historical context (e.g., significance of "line-work", specific artists mentioned) could confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
