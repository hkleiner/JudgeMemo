Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Then hotel back more at the to the went lady and young once I interviewed the desk."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary (e.g., "somber", "supererogatory") might impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [SPELLING] None detected in the current segment.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the description of the room and the shift to "What was I to do in this war town...".
- [CLARITY] The sentence "However, there was still the morrow and Bar-le-Duc." feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the "CHAPTER" title within the segment disrupts the narrative flow, assuming it's part of the evaluated text.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
