Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "And if there be law it must at bottom be one law.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of abstract terms without clear explanation (e.g., "Unknowable Force", "Unconditioned Reality")
- [SPELLING/Grammatical Consistency] Minor inconsistency in punctuation and capitalization (e.g., "I say apparent vagueness and laxity because, subtly underlying all this varied usage, is the unifying conception of Source as the ultimate basis of all enforcement.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning in explaining the Unknowable (e.g., "We only know that it exists, and somehow produces the whole show.")
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Spencer's philosophy and the limitations of science (no clear connector)
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with multiple, intertwined ideas

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
