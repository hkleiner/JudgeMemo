Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "his let," standing favourite, cousin can said Marjorie Donald up; "for her try." (incomprehensible sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "cairngorm" (commonly spelled as "carnelian" for the stone, though "carn gorm" means blue rock in Gaelic, and the intended reference might be to a "carnelian" or more likely an "agate" or simply a descriptive error)
- [LEXICON] "man 's, Janet the tears was and brave girlcame little." (seems to be a jumbled phrase, possibly a typo or formatting error)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing the piper's uniform to discussing the bravery of Scotch regiments without a clear connector.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the castle visit to viewing the Crown jewels feels somewhat abrupt without a transitional phrase or sentence to guide the reader smoothly.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
