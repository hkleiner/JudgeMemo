Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure in several paragraphs, disrupting flow.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "fearsome disease eats into the very fibre of character") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but archaic language ("to-morrow", "quarrelled") might affect modern readers' fluency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between discussing the bookman's sacrifices and the philosophical reflection on tastes in pleasure.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment, jumping between the bookman's behaviors, his emotional state, and broader philosophical musings without clear connectors.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted (e.g., the paragraph starting with "He things restored..."), reducing clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
