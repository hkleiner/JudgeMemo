Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Patience the Him...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices or phrases feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "hutungs", "Hatamen Street" without context for unfamiliar readers).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Kuei Ping's departure preparations to her spiritual transformation without a clear transitional phase.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph starting with "Patience the Him..." contains confusing, possibly typo-ridden text that disrupts understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
