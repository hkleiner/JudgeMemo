Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "kutas", "kutas", "oxen hair") might require additional context for full understanding.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected within the provided segment.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between vastly different topics (e.g., from marriage customs to physical descriptions to intellectual capabilities).
- [CLARITY] Assumptions of prior knowledge about referenced groups (e.g., Sarö Yögurs, Kalmucks, Tanguts) without brief contextualization within this segment.
- [LOGIC] No logical inconsistencies detected, but topic shifts could improve with clearer sectioning or transitional phrases.
