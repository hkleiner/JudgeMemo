2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge (e.g., references to specific biblical figures/events without context) 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical periods and ideas (e.g., jumping from Abraham to Spinoza without clear connection) 
- [CLARITY] Dense, packed paragraphs hinder easy understanding of the argument's flow
