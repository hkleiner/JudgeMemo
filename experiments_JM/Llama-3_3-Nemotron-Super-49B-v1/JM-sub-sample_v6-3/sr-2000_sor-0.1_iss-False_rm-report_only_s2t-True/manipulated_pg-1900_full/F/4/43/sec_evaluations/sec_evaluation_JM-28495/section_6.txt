Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He was going to visit friends in the north. Aren't you, darling?" (informal tag in formal context)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some descriptions (e.g., "lumbering and ill-balanced body") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing Oxford comma in several places) but not distracting

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Excalibur's adventure to Chapter VII without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The curate's dream and its context in Chapter VII could be more clearly introduced
- [LOGIC] Excalibur's immediate recognition of the curate after years without clear prior indication of such strong memory

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
