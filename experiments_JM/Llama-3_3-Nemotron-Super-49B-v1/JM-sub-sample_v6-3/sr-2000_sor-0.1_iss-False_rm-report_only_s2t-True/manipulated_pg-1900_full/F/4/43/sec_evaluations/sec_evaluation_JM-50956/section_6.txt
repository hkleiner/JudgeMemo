Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Russia, although sapped by the Germano-Bolshevist conspiracy, was still formidable...")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "Russia" without variation
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent spacing around em dashes (e.g., "=162 divisions=")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers understand strategic implications without explanation (e.g., "strategy says plainly:...")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing losses to concluding chapter without a clear link
- [CLARITY] Overly technical language may confuse non-expert readers (e.g., "strategic deploying of forces")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
