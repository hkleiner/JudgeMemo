Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon the old stone bridge...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ceaseless stream", "necessaries of life", "forearmed") might slightly hinder readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Manila's life to the notice about supplies without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The shift in scene (e.g., from Manila to the journey to Bacalod) could benefit from clearer transitional phrases for smoother flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
