Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mitrailleuses", "horizon blue") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing war scenes to train travel observations without a clear connecting phrase.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the war's context (e.g., "the battle of the Somme", "â€˜70") without brief elaboration for unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
