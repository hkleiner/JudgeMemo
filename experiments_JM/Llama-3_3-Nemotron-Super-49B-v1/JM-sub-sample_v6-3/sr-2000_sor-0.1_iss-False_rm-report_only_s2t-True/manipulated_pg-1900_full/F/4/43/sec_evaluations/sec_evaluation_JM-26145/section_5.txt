Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "unparalleled", "tenfold") might require additional mental processing for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from discussing the prince of Alashia to Tushratta and Napkhuria's interaction feels somewhat disconnected without clearer transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different topics (e.g., commercial matters, plague, diplomatic exchanges) without strong cohesive links.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
