Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "It long to then he began a smoke stemmed that-was pipe." (Incorrect sentence structure and wording)
- [SPELLING] "Te much his felt more as call his father as Boyet every of to, attention seem unto little ’s day not," (Multiple spelling and grammatical errors in a single sentence)
- [SYNTAX] "Fuh Tang’s earnings, plus some money he had possessed at the time of their taking the small home in Peking, had been sufficient for only a very simple mode of life." (While understandable, the sentence is overly complex and could be simplified for better flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from Fuh Tang's illness to his opium use feels somewhat abrupt without clearer emotional or logical bridging.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between multiple time frames (e.g., the baby's first steps, Fuh Tang's illness, the death of the second son) without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "Even fascinating he himself grew Te much his felt more as call his father as Boyet every of to, attention seem unto little ’s day not," is completely obscured due to errors.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
