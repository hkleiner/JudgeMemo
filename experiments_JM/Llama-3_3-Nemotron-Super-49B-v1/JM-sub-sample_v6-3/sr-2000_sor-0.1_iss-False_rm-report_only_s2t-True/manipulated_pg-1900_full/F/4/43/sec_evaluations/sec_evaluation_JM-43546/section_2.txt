Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "You may read out-of-doors very often, in the northern cities and towns, at eleven o'clock at night."
- [LEXICON] Informal tone in explanations (e.g., "You must know porridge is a good thing...") disrupts narrative flow.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Uncle Clarke's news to breakfast details.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed explanations (e.g., marmalade origin, Scotland's daylight) slightly detract from main narrative.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between Donald's concern for Uncle Clarke and the subsequent school departure scene.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
