1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "nethermost", "unconstrained") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing historical evil and the importance of unity could be more explicitly connected.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between broad philosophical discussions and specific Bahá'í teachings without clear transitional phrases.
