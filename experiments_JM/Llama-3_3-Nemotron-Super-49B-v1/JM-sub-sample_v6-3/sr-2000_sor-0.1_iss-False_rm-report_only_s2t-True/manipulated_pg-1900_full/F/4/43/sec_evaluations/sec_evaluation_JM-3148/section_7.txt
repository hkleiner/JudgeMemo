Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Her heart was divided between a great throb of pity and sympathy for him and an irresistible sense of gratitude for herself.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more concise for smoother flow (e.g., "mendacious word" might be less common for some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic description to everyday dialogue (e.g., the shift from describing Lyddy's emotional state to the conversation about the boy's illness)
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the boy's condition and its progression (e.g., the severity and specifics of "fever with burning" could be clearer)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
