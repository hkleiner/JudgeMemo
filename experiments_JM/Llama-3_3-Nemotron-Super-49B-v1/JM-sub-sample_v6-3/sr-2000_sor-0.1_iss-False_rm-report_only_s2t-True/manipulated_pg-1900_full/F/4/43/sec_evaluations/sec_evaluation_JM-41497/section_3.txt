Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "has lost... faux pas are few" to "He keeps a liberal but ill-served table")
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "turgid", "faux pas", "flaneurs")
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph discussing Reynolds' studio crowds)
- [SPELLING] Potential typo: "roughly critic Joshua" (likely "rueful critic" or similar)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Reynolds' artistic techniques to his personal life and back
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the worst has been said" without clear context)
- [LOGIC] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about certain historical figures and events without brief explanation
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between paragraphs (e.g., from Chapter II to III)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
