2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Fragonard's death to discussing his legacy and the broader artistic context without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The sentence "His is the last word of that mock-heroic France..." could benefit from clearer explanation for readers unfamiliar with the historical context
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Fragonard's family's peaceful end to the artistic analysis feels disconnected
