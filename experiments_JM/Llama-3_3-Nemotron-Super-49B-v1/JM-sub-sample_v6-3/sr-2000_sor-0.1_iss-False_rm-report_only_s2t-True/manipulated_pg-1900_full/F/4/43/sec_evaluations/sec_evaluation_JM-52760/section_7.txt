Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The their they who was, hardship or would to, return any, homes when peculiar a discouragement the, of if never knew homesick not to rank." (Context, but affects transition)
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" (likely correct in context, but may cause pause for some readers; however, given the context, this might not be an error but rather a stylistic choice)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "penetrating rain", "despair", "extravagance") may hinder readability for general audiences.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and incorrect pronoun usage in scattered sentences (e.g., "When spring came to warm the air, there was a difference between the two opposing armies.")
- [SYNTAX] Repetitive sentence beginnings (e.g., multiple sentences starting with "Then", "When")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing the Episcopal bishop's visit to discussing Lee's military strategy without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., discussing events of March 2, then March 23, without clear transitional phrases).
- [CLARITY] Overly technical military terminology and location names without sufficient explanation for non-expert readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between paragraphs, especially when shifting from descriptive scenes to strategic planning.
