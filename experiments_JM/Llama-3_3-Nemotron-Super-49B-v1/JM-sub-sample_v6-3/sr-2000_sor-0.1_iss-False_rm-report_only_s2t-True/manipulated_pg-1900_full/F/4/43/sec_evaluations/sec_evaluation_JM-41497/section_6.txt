Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "rife", "finality", "civilised") might require a second read for full comprehension by all audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Reynolds' approach to painting men versus women/children to the impact of restoration on his works feels somewhat abrupt.
- [CLARITY] The assertion about Reynolds' interest in men vs. women/children could be more clearly connected to the preceding and following text for enhanced flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
