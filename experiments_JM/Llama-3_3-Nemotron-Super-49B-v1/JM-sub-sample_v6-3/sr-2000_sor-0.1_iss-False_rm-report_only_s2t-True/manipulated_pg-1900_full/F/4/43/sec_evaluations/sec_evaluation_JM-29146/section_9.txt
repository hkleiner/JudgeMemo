Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It Symm Garr was's voice." (inconsistent quotation mark usage)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of passive voice in some descriptions (e.g., "was lifted", "was gone")
- [SPELLING] Missing article in "a black rectangular object" (could imply a specific object, but context suggests a general description might be intended)
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency in "Ramsey had not breathed, not once, since they left" (could be clarified for better flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Contradiction: Irwadi's death from lack of air in a timeless world (undermines established rules)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the vision to the new characters' arrival (could benefit from a smoother link)
- [CLARITY] Unclear motivation behind Symm's sudden claim "The box is mine, mine!" (lacks preceding context for full understanding)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
