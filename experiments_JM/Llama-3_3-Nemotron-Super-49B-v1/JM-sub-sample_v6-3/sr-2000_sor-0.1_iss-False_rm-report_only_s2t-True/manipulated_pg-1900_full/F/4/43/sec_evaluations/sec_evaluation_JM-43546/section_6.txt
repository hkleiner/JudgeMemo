Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "Both the 's ornament see and much picture the were to brooches swords daggers the, to tartans used in into set stones ancient often used these, of as piper Scotch were andfasten you." (Severely disjointed sentence)
- [SPELLING] "andsfasten" (Typo, likely "and fasten")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "and" in listing items (e.g., "little claymores and daggers for pins, and copies of old-time brooches, and all kinds of quaint things.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from shopping to visiting the Scott Monument without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Much has been written by Scottish authors and poets about the daring deeds of the Border Clans of that time." feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate context of visiting Abbotsford.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the day's end to introducing the next chapter ("CHAPTER: THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS") is abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
