Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or specialized vocabulary (e.g., "tshi", "t'idu", "t'umus") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical context, demographic details, administrative divisions, customs, and marriage practices without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of Chinese and YÃ¶gur historical and cultural contexts may leave some explanations unclear to uninformed readers.
