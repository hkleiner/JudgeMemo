Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "heterogeneous", "inartistic", "sylvan cells") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph describing the violin's sound) could improve with simpler punctuation or division.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps abruptly from describing Lyddy's home life to her emotional response to the violin music without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The lengthy, poetic description of the violin's music, while beautiful, slightly detours from the main narrative flow, potentially confusing some readers about its immediate relevance.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
