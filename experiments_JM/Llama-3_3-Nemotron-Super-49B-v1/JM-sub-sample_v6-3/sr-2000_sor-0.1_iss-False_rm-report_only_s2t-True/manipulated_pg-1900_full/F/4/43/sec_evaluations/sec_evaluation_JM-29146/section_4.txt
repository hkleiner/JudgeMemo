Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure (e.g., "So you told me. I couldn't have wished for more.")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial expressions (e.g., "Darn her hide", "Gmph!")
- [SPELLING] Potential typo ("inducements, and costumeobvious" appears to be a jumbled phrase, possibly a typo or formatting error)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and inconsistent verb tense in some dialogue (e.g., "I'm prepared to pay you one thousand credits; what do you say?")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained actions (Ramsey kissing Margot without clear buildup)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene changes (e.g., from the apartment to the street without transition)
- [CLARITY] Unclear motivations (Margot's true intentions and the significance of the letter are not fully explained within this segment)
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the discovery of the letter and the continuation of the plot

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
