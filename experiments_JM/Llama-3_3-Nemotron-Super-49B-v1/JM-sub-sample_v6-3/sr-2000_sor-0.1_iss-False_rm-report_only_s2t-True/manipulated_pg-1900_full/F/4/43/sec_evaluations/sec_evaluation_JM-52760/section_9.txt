Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "The result had been the capture of Petersburg and Richmond, but more important, it had led to the flight of the remnants...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "relentless attrition") might require additional cognitive effort for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the fall of Petersburg to shifting focus towards the broader outcome of the war (e.g., the jump to "On the Sunday following...").
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Petersburg had fallen, but it was at a heavy price." feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding context without clearer transitional phrasing.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
