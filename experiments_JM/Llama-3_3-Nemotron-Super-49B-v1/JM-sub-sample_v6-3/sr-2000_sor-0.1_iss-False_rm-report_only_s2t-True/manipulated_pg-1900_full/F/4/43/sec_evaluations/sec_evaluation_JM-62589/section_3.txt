Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure (e.g., "me with you proper share place")
- [LEXICON] Word choice could be more precise (e.g., "bedraggled" might not be the best fit for the context of entering an army headquarters)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors (e.g., "Iâ€™ll be eighteen soon" in a historical context where age representation might be handled differently)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Debby's decision to the introduction of "Robert Shirtliffe" without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or wordy, slightly hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the explanation of old Mason's bravery)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
