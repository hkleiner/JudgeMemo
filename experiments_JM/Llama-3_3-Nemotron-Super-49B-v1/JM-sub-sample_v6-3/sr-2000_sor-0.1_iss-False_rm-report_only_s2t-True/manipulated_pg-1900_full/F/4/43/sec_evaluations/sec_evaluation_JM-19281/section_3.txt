Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist audiences (e.g., "inescapable requirement", "reconsideration of received doctrine")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "What has not changed is the inescapable requirement...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about religious systems' inability to adapt are stated without explicit evidence within the segment
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing global integration's effects to the dilemma faced by Bahá'ís without a clear connecting sentence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
