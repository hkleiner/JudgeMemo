Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "One from knew another was day to to what never going one happen."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "seething with revolution", "grim determination")
- [SPELLING] Typo in "one from knew" (likely "one knew from another")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "a timely advance of one hundred francs" (should be "a timely advance of one hundred francs" is correct, but "obtained for him from the Minister" could be clearer)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's struggles to describing the 1848 European political situation without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological jump in the narrative (e.g., introducing Millet's second wife without prior context in the current segment)
- [CLARITY] Unclear implication of "The issue was for long in the balance" without specifying what "the issue" refers to

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
