Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "One of them was retained by the Lodge and now occupies a prominent place in the East, there to remain for all time to come, never to be used again except it be by the President of the United States, the governor of Texas, or the Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "Estered Apprentice", "Fellow Craft")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issue: "in 1914 a resolution was passed, instructing the worshipful master to present..." (missing article "a" before "resolution" for clarity, though not strictly grammatical error)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Masonic Lodge to introducing new chapters without clear connectors.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Masonic terms and historical figures without brief explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs, especially when shifting topics (e.g., from lodge history to college buildings).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
