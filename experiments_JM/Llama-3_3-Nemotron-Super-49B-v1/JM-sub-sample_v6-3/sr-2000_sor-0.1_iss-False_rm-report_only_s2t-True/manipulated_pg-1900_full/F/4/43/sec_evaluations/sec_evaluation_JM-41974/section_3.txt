Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "And the to had the in prodigy he is all have," (incoherent sentence structure)
- [LEXICON] "Loyal the that was the declared thus, of competition taken he own who the he painters was of and Veronese had votes, in himself voice artist solicited and winner noble his by part the competitors." (word choice and sentence structure obscure meaning)
- [GRAMMAR] "it was also the period in which he executed his largest and most celebrated paintings, notably his famous canvas of the Wedding at Cana, his Feast at the House of the Pharisee, his Feast at the House of the Leper, and his Feast at the House of Simon." (missing Oxford comma for clarity, though not strictly an error, it affects readability)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Veronese's general work and the specific "CHAPTER: THE WEDDING AT CANA" without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of the time period, artists, and locations without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
