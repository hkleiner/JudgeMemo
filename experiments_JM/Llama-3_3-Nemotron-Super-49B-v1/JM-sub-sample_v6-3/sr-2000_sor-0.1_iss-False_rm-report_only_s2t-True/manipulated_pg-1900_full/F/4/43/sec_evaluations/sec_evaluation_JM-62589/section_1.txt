Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "After to his had upon her she was and leaving, she suffered turning his as her borne, fare back sake all he for might." (incomprehensible sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "thou thee, will, tell who when my," (appears to be a jumbled, uncorrected thought process without clear narrative intent)
- [SYNTAX] Frequent use of archaic language ("thou", "thee") without consistent narrative voice or clear stylistic justification

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional turmoil to a detailed description of her life under Mrs. Lane without a clear connecting thought
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from present suffering to memories of her mother) without smooth transitions
- [CLARITY] Overly vague phrase "the untold story was never finished or asked for" without sufficient context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
