Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in "It was some little time the next morning before he could realize what he was doing out there under the tree."
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("yer", "g--a' mile'") may disrupt flow for some readers

- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the deer incident to the conversation about the boy's dad without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jump from the home trip to the conversation with Bud
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrase "going do guess n't I to Bud said?" lacks clarity
