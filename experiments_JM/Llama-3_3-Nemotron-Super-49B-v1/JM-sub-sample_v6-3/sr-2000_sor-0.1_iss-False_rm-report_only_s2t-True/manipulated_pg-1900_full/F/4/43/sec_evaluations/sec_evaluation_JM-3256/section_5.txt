- [SYNTAX] Complex, winding sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., the anecdote about the bookman's struggle)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative with abrupt shifts between historical references, personal anecdotes, and humorous advice (e.g., the pledge for bookmen)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between some paragraphs (e.g., from discussing Mary Queen of Scots to the hereditary nature of book mania)
