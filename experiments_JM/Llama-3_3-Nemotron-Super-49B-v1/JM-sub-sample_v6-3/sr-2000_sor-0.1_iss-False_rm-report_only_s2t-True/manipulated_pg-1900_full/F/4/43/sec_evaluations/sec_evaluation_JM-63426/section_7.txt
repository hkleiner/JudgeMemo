Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "During this type-display and foundry-publicity period...").
- [LEXICON] Some outdated terms ("swaddling clothes", "rompers") might require additional context for modern readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage across different narrative sections.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between biographical narrative and industry commentary (e.g., shift from personal story to magazine industry history).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., "Gibson Girl hangover") without brief explanation for unfamiliar readers.
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnect between the expectation of a "newsstand disappointment" and the lack of elaboration on its implications.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
