Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "reticulated stonework", "foliated capitals") might slow comprehension for non-specialists.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between architectural descriptions and historical figure anecdotes (e.g., Archbishop Howley's incident).
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of referenced texts (e.g., Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales") and historical events (e.g., Magna Charta) without brief context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
