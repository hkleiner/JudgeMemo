Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [LEXICON] Informal language and slang may impede readability for some readers (e.g., "yer", "nigger", "hyah")
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but names and terms (e.g., "Mr. Ollendorf's French method") could benefit from context

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from the boy's emotional outburst to the agent's interrogation
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow within the segment (e.g., shifting between dialogue and description without clear transitions)
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and relationships (e.g., Jim's decision to take the boy) could be more explicitly stated

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
