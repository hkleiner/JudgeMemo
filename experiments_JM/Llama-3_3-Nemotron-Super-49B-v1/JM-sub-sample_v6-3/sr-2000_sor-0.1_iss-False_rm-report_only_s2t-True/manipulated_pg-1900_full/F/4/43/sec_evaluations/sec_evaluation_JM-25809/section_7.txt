1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in "They had shadow and the threw ca√±on upon of--wild day-thewhen 's sun work--cat certain mark side the 's was wall western the a mark hole the, the finishedon was a it." (appears to be a corrupted or incomplete sentence)
- [LEXICON] Informal dialect ("Bime-by", "yer", "ol' beggar") may hinder readability for some readers
- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "finishe**d**on" (should likely be "finished")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from tunnel work to a hunting trip without clear transitional context
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different scenes (tunnel, cabin, hunting) without smooth transitions
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It all looked so easy. It was as if the dirt were very soft, and not the striker very strong." could be clearer in conveying its point about Jim's strength vs. the dirt's hardness
