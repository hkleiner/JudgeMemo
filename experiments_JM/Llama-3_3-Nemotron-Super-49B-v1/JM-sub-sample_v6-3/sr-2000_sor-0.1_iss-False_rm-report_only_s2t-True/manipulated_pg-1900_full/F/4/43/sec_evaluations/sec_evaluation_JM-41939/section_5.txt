Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the an, in artist place the sent met order had" (incoherent sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "Mocquard" (inconsistent capitalization, though likely a name, context suggests it should be capitalized if a proper noun, but the rest of the text capitalizes names properly)
- [SYNTAX] "Many power whole young in was the not included among herself, it of the if and give career pupils being pupils worthy honourable Rosa her," (illogical and poorly structured sentence)
- [LEXICON] "purplish and cottony" (while not incorrect, this phrase feels out of place without further context on why it's criticized, slightly affecting fluency due to its abruptness)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the Universal Exposition to introducing Rosa Bonheur's art school without a clear connecting sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from 1867 back to 1849 without a smooth transition).
- [CLARITY] The purpose of mentioning "Mlle. Maraudon de Monthycle" is unclear without additional context on her relevance to Rosa Bonheur's story.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Rosa Bonheur's personal life to her artistic output (e.g., listing specific works) feels disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
