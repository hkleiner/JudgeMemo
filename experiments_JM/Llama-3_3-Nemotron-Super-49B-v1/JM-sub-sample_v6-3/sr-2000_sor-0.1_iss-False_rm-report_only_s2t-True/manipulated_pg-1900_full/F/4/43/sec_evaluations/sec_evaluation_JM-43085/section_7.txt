Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "I discovered, in the little court adjoining the ch√¢let, Meissonier out in the blazing sunlight astride of a bench that did duty for a horse"
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "cumbered", "redingote", "breeches of white cashmere")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Meissonier's sketching to discussing his collection of relics without a clear connecting phrase
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about linen being cut on the bias, while illustrative, feels somewhat tangential and disrupts the flow focused on Meissonier's artistic process

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
