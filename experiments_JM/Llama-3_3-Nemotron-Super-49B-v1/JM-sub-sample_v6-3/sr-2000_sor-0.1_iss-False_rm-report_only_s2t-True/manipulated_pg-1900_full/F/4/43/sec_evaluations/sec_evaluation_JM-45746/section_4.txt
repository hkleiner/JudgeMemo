- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different school activities (athletic association, literary society, school news) without a clear overarching structure or transition
- [CLARITY] The quote from the Seattle high school principal feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative without explicit integration
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the story about the board and the introduction of "SCHOOL ACTIVITIES"
