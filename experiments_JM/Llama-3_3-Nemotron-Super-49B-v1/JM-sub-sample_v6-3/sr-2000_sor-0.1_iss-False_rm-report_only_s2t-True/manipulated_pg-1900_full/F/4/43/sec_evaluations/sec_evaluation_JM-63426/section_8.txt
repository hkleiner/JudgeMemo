(Severely garbled sentence structure and word order)
- [SPELLING] "the shook given had that; to head been that orders be clerk to no calls put were his through phone floor." (Apparent typo or transcription error)
- [SYNTAX] Frequent use of long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph starting with "One morning a request came from Mr. Hearst...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing work on Cosmopolitan and the introduction of the Hearst International project without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Overly technical jargon (e.g., "signature distribution of colors") without explanation, potentially confusing non-specialist readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal or logical connection between the "Patria" project and the subsequent independent production ("Moongold").
