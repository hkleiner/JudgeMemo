Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The aspirations shadows of 'events'; to but Irish brain no progress;..." 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "nebulous", "counterintuitive" not present but similar complexity)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing articles, unclear commas)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Tennyson's allegory to criticizing modern literary preferences
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression of ideas within paragraphs (e.g., jumping between Tennyson's work and broader Victorian context)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly dense and require re-reading for clarity (e.g., "It is the opposite failing from that of Macaulay...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
