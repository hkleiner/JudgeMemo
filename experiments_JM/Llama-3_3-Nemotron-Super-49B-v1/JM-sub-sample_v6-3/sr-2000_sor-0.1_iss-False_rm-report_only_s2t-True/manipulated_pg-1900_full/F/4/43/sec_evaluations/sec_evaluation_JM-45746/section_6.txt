- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between narrative and analytical/discursive sections without a smooth integration, affecting the overall flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., "The use of tests and measurements has demonstrated the wide range of abilities that can usually be found in different pupils of the same grade.").
