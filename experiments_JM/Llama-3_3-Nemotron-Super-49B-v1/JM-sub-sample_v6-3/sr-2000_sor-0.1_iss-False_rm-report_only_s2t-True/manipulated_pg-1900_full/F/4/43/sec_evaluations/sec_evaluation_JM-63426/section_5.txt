Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., the description of Colonial typography and the introduction of Mr. Moses).
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "Ã¦sthetic awakening", "fallow field").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing typography's historical context to the personal story of the Wayside Press's location and setup.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph starting with "Wearing me of..." is confusing due to unclear sentence structure and missing context for the apron's significance initially.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
