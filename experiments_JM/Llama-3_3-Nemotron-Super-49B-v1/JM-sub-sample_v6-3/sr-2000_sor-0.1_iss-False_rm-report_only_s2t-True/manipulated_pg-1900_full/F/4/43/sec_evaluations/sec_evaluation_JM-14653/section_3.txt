Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The custom is a most striking one--so long as we have sufficient imagination to remember vividly that we are all in the same boat--I mean, on the same planet--and clinging desperately to the flying ball, and dependent for daily happiness on one another's good will!"
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in "mischief", "contrivances", "stale", and "insincerity" may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "a Christmas card sent by one human being to another human being is more than a piece of coloured stationery sent by one log of wood to another log of wood"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing social justice to the importance of Christmas festivals
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear paragraph breaks or headings to distinguish between different ideas (e.g., shift from social reform to Christmas customs)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrase "the corporate human existence bearable amid the menaces and mysteries" without clear context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
