Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "scepticism", "claptrap rhetoric", "fervour") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between discussing social conditions, literary figures, and philosophical underpinnings could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical figures (e.g., Carlyle, Ruskin, Plato) and events might reduce clarity for some.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
