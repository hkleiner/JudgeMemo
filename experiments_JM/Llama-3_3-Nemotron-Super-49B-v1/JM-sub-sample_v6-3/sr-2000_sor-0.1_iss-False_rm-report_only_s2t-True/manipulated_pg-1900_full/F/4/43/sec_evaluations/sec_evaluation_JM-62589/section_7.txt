Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "For during the time which lay between his leaving Boston and now as he sat beside the Delaware river in New Jersey, Shirtliffe had not seen, or heard of Morley."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some dialogue (e.g., "I was but binding up my feet") may disrupt natural flow for some readers.
- [SPELLING] None detected

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's personal struggle to the encounter with Washington without clear transitional context.
- [CLARITY] The significance of finding Morley and its connection to the broader narrative could be more explicitly reinforced in this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
