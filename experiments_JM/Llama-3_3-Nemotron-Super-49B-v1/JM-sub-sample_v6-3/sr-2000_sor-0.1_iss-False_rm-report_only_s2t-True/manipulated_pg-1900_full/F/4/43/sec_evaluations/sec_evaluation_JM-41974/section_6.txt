Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Veronese the remaining to privilege had rare young of end the." (incomprehensible sentence structure)
- [LEXICON] "prodigious facility" (while not incorrect, somewhat archaic and less common in modern writing, may cause slight pause for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] "No one knows all the pictures which he painted for private individuals, nor all the frescoes with which he adorned certain dwellings that have since disappeared." (complex sentence structure, though clear, contributes to a slightly dense reading experience)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's work to "But Veronese was no longer young..." (could benefit from a smoother connection)
- [CLARITY] "Veronese the remaining to privilege had rare young of end the." (completely unclear, disrupts understanding)
- [TRANSITION] From "CHAPTER: THE LAST YEARS" to the preceding text lacks a clear thematic bridge (though the chapter title somewhat mitigates this)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
