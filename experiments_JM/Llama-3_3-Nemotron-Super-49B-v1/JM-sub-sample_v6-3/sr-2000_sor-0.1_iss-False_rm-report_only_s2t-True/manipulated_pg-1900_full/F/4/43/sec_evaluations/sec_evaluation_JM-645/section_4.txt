Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I hadn’t so much as hinted at that: no wonder the writer hadn’t been flattered!")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "vulgar" in context, "supersubtlety") might require a second read for full comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the narrator's personal struggle to the introduction of George Corvick's reaction without a clear connecting phrase
- [CLARITY] The narrator's emotional state and motivations (e.g., why the search becomes "humiliating") could be more explicitly stated for smoother understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
