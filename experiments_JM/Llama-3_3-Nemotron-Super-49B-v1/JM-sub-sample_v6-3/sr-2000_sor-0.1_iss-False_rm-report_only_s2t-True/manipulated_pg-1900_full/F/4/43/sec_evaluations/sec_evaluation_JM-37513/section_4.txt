Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "And what about force? ...")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "whence", "sanctioned by custom")
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are too long and convoluted, hindering immediate understanding

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning in the discussion of "energy" and "force" (revisiting the same conceptual debate without clear resolution)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's views to introducing Mill's perspective without a clear connector
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between critiquing Spencer, defining terms, and discussing scientific interpretation without a clear overarching structure for the section

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
