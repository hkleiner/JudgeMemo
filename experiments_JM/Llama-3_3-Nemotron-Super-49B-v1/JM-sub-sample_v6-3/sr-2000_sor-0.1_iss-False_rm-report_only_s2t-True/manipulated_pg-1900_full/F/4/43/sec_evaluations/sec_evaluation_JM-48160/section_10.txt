Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling corrections noted (e.g., "uremitting", "euphenism", "miliary", etc.) as per Transcriberâ€™s note, though not directly observed in the provided segment.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "euphemism", "unremitting", "haute bourgeoisie") might slightly impede readability for non-native or less literate readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between describing hospital conditions, a specific patient's story, and a broader appeal for aid, which might slightly disrupt the flow for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, especially when shifting from hospital descriptions to the economic situation of the French noblesse.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
