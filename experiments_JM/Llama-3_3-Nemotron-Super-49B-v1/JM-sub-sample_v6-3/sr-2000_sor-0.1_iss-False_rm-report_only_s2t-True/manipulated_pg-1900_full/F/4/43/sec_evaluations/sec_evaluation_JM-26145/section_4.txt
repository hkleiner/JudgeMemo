- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "proportionately", "broad", "cuneiform" in casual context)
- [SPELLING] Apparent typo ("Napkhuriaâ€”i.e., Akhenaten" lacks clarity on connection without prior context in this segment)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "times had changed sadly for him and men of his type" could imply unclear subject reference)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between discussing Tushratta's letters and introducing Napkhuria/Akhenaten
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumps between historical figures and events without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "Our Lady of Nineveh" without immediate context for unfamiliar readers)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from Tushratta's grief to Napkhuria's accession)
