Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "inexperienced", "barbarians") may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing trapper stories to introducing Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, reducing clarity (e.g., the paragraph comparing Henry Esmond and another character)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between some paragraphs (e.g., from _Monte Christo_ to the discussion of Scott)
