Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It was a beautiful clear morning, not a breath stirring and we thoroughly enjoyed the splendid day.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "croached", "resembled reeds more than grass")
- [SPELLING] Potential typo ("conple" instead of "couple")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing the journey and the detailed description of the monastery's appearance
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of locations (e.g., "the village Kanchenp'u", "Li-yen") without clear context for unfamiliar readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of the journey description and the start of the monastery description

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
