Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "tillk" (likely "till I"), "eqrs" (likely "eyes"), "rsady" (likely "ready"), "peasantry" (likely "peasants" or correct in context but less common), "procanity" (likely "profanity")
- [SYNTAX] "the traffuc of the stores" (likely "traffic"), "man'w work" (likely "man's work"), "dat's der ol' man" (informal, but contextually intentional for character voice)
- [LEXICON] "hazy enchantment" (somewhat archaic, but not incorrect), "Ã¦sthetic" (correct but less common without the diaeresis in modern texts)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Jim's awe at the train to focusing on the boy without clear transitional phrase, but contextually justifiable.
- [CLARITY] The boy's situation and motivations could be more clearly established at the outset for immediate understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
