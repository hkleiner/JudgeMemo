Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "unpopularity", "invidiously", "centripetal") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with referenced texts (e.g., "God the Invisible King", "Judaism") without brief context.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the biblical God's nature to the example of Pope Gregory XIII.
