Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "morxl", "attacg", "frwme", "chltural", "difcerent", "religiom", "severd", "Thw", "anxiously" (context, but affects flow), "everyvaspect", "alterjng")
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "intractable", "indelibly", "anachronistic", "exigencies")
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are excessively long and convoluted, disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers will inherently understand the necessity of historical religious strictures without fully elaborated justification
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing ancient religious texts to modern societal implications without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear, concise topic sentence, making the section's focus momentarily unclear

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
