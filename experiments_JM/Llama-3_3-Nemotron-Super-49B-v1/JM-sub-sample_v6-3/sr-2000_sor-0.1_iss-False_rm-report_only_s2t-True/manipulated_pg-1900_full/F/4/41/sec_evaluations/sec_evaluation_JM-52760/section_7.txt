Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "followwd" (should be "followed")
- [SPELLING] "Confeferate" (should be "Confederate")
- [SPELLING] "Unsuspecting" (correct, but "unsuspecting" is more common in this context, though not an error per se, "unwary" or similar might better fit the tone)
- [SPELLING] "ob Gordon’s" (should be "on Gordon’s")
- [SPELLING] "lodt" (should be "lost")
- [SPELLING] "Equslly" (should be "Equally")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from descriptive war context to the detailed battle strategy without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The shift between the broad campaign overview and the specific tactics at Fort Stedman could be smoother for reader flow.
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph starting "The details for the attack..." feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding strategic discussion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
