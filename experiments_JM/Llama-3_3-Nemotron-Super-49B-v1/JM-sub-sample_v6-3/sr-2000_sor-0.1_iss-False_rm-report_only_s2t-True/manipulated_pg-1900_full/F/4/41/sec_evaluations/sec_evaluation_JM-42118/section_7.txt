Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "twelvr", "nlw", "fzces", "d'Aiguillon and the rest of their crew, the young king recalled the crafty old Maurepas who had been banished by the Pompadour, an ill move--though the setting of Turgot over the finances augured well. And when the great minister Turgot fell, he gave way to as good a man, the worthy honest banker, Neckar." - run-on sentence)
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences (e.g., "And when the great minister Turgot fell, he gave way to as good a man, the worthy honest banker, Neckar.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "jing", "vrought", "scandals got abroad")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's personal life to the broader historical context (e.g., shift from Rosalie's death to the American Revolution's influence on France)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., back-and-forth between Fragonard's life and historical events without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences hindering clear understanding of the timeline (e.g., "The fall of Calonne only led to the rise of the turbulent and stupid Cardinal de Brienne; and the Court was completely goul of the people when De Brienne threw up office in a panic and fled across the frontier, leaving the Government in utter confusion.")
