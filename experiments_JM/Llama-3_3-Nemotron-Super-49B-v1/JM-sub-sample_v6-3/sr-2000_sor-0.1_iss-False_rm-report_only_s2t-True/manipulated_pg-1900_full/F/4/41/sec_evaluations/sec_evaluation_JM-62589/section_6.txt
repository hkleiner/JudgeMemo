Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "Lrt's", "vaint", "doe for", "qt", "tue", "ovwr", "sufferkng", "yearning" -> "yearning" is correct, but context suggests "yearly" might be intended in some cases, however "yearning" fits)
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense shifts (e.g., "had left" to "was leaving")
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language in some parts (e.g., "sickening sensation", "awful agony") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences or sentences needing clearer punctuation for clarity (e.g., "He must make the best of what time and strength he had left.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Robert's escape to the detailed description of his ride without clear time/frame setting
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment can confuse without prior context (e.g., "the quiet figure by the road")
- [CLARITY] Character motivations and backstories (e.g., Robert and Martin's past) are hinted at but not clearly explained within this segment
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in focus from the group's realization of their mistake to Robert's solo ride without a clear bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
