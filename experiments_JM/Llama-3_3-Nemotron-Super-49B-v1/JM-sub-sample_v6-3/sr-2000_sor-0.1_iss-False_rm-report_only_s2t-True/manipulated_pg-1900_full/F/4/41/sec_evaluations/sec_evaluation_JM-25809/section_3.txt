Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple instances of intentional non-standard spelling for dialect (e.g., "wot", "yer", "hyah") which may affect readability for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "smasher", "kerplection") that might require additional context or familiarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the intense confrontation scene to the more lighthearted, comedic interaction with Happy Jack without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The boy's rapid emotional shifts (from fury to sobbing to defiance) while understandable, are somewhat jarringly presented without deeper emotional context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
