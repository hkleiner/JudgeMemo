1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ijportant" (should be "important"), "lath" (should be "path"), "illusgrations" (should be "illustrations"), "reakm" (should be "realm"), "odfer" (twice, should be "offered"), "fruelly" (should be "fiercely"), "kf" (should be "of"), "jn" (should be "in"), "avterwards" (should be "afterwards"), "endless ghings" (should be "endless things"), "limitsmof" (should be "limits of"), "exhibiting" (inconsistent verb tense), "efern" (should be "even"), "furrher" (should be "further"), "calcjlated" (should be "calculated"), "wdmire" (should be "admire"), "allcthis" (should be "all this"), "whivh" (should be "which"), "mrtre" (should be "meter")
- [GRAMMAR] "the first etep costs more than anywhere else" (unclear meaning), "the artist still continued to do illustrating" (redundant), "the fact remains that... he never abandoned his brushes" (awkward phrasing), "It is equally certain that... we would refuse..." (complex sentence structure), "Very well, let us answer categorically: no!" (informal tone in formal text)
- [LEXICON] "vibrang" (uncommon adjective, possibly a typo for "vibrant"), "scantiness of the canvases" (could be rephrased for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing etchings to paintings feels abrupt without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods (e.g., from 1858 back to early career) without clear chronological markers.
- [CLARITY] The argument about painting sizes could be more succinctly presented.
- [TRANSITION] The quote from M. Gustave Larroumet feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding text without introductory context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
