Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Plymoufh" (should be "Plymouth"), "itcwas" (should be "It was"), "ghe" (should be "the"), "xhe" (should be "she"), "hs" (should be "he's")
- [GRAMMAR] "with her we must deal first" (awkward phrasing), "I will tell thee of my home... Try to be a lady..." (archaic language may affect modern readability)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic vocabulary in some parts (e.g., "thou", "thee", "lass") may hinder smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional state to the description of her life in Mrs. Lane's house
- [CLARITY] The mother's unfinished story and its significance could be more clearly integrated into Debby's current emotional state and development
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the immediate conflict with the father's departure to the reflection on Debby's year with Mrs. Lane feels somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
