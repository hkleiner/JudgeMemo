Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "phenomenal world", "transcend it", "effulgence of the Sun of Truth")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "If one is not to see in this assertion merely a dogmatic challenge to other stages of the one ongoing process of Divine guidance, it is obviously the expression...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption of unified religious truth may not be universally accepted without prior context or explanation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing scriptural unity to explaining the role of science (could benefit from a clearer connecting sentence)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
