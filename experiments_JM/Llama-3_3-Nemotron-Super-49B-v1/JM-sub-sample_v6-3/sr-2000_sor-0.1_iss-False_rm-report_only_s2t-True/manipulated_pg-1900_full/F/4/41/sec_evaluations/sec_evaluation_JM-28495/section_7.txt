Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "instrujent", "sgall", "unhurf", "bouleversement" (contextually incorrect, likely meant "bouleversement" but used inappropriately), "lver", "kw", "Cavsrsham", "oe", "fonfederate", "shakdn", "lodging-house-drudge" (not an error but overly complex))
- [GRAMMAR] "There were fourteen of these altogerher" (agreement error)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary for general readability (e.g., "bouleversement", "lodging-house-drudge")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the train accident and the introduction of Lord Caversham's conversation in the hotel (lack of clear temporal or spatial connection)
- [CLARITY] The character "Mary Ellen" is introduced without clear context or relevance explanation initially
- [LOGIC] The curate's immediate concern for "those poor folks in the sleeper" feels unconnected to his actions post-accident (inconsistency in character behavior)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
