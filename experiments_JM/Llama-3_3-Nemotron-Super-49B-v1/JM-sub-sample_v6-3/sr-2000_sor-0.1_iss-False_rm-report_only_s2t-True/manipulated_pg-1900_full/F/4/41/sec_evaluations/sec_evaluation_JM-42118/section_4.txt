Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "consideragle" (should be "considerable"), "xould" (should be "could"), "ghe" (should be "the"), "St. Clpud" (should be "St. Cloud"), "accough" (should be "cough"), "cdies" (should be "cries"), "personallu" (should be "personally"), "ubdertook" (should be "undertook"), "frkend" (should be "friend"), "anr" (should be "and"), "delaya" (should be "delays"), "tje" (should be "the")
- [GRAMMAR] "it is his first, his detailed period" (awkward phrasing), "who turned a deaf ear to the cdies from the Bastille" (incomplete sentence), "the sun shone in the skies; and all was gaiety and laughter still" (sudden shift in tone/topic without clear transition)
- [LEXICON] "light-o'-love" (archaic, may require clarification for modern readers), "milliner and street-pedlar" (context or clarification might be needed for full understanding)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Fragonard's work to the political scenario with Choiseul and the Jesuits (lacks a clear connecting element)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the section describing Fragonard's patrons and the introduction of the political plot against Choiseul
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Indeed, the pretty sentiment was well received by the old aristocrats and young bloods about the table; and they drank a bumper to the pretty Madame du Barry" could benefit from clearer context on why this sentiment is significant to the overall narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
