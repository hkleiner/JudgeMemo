Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "vto", "anothwr", "sadsle", "iu", "boyh", "encircling... againnto", "ebcircled", "Pltanin")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "which name the place really deserves for its good fruit-trees -- pear, apricot and nut.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "imbibed" instead of "spent" for time, though not strictly incorrect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the Shera Yögurs' farewell to detailing the geographical journey
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about locations (e.g., "the Yögur country") without brief context in the segment
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between the visit to Li-yen and the departure to Kanchenp'u/Kanchow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
