- [SYNTAX] Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ab initio", "heteropathic")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with referenced authors' works without brief context
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between discussing specific relational types and broader philosophical implications could be smoother
- [CLARITY] Concept of "constitutive properties" and its distinction from "additive" could benefit from clearer explanation for non-specialist readers
