Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "abkut" (should be "about"), "hiwever" (should be "however"), "wkuld" (should be "would"), "rhe" (should be "the"), "automkbile" (should be "automobile"), "mattsr" (should be "matter"), "cyriosity" (should be "curiosity"), "retutning" (should be "returning"), "amva" (should be "am a"), "exoected" (should be "expected"), "Wd" (should be "We")
- [GRAMMAR] "James M. Beck visited Amiens on his way from England to Paris, and within two days of his arrival went off on a tour of the immediate front. The day after his return, off he went again..." (awkward sentence structure for clarity)
- [LEXICON] "callous as if inoculated" (could be clearer for all readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the woman's story to "No taubes appeared, and I slept in Paris." (lacks a smoother connection)
- [CLARITY] "It is astonishing the high value the French place upon the life of a mere woman." (context or explanation for this statement could enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with the context)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the automobile trip description to "Our adventures were almost too insignificant to mention." feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding detailed account.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
