Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "llaced", "tearz", "uer", "tje", "soafrron", "thw", "mynsterious", "irrdgular")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the pattern that a moonbeam mace", "Noiselessly she slid the bar and stood without the compound" could be more fluid)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common (e.g., "seeming", "stilled her own trembling" is effective but less common in modern narrative)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the wedding feast to the moonlit night scene without clear temporal marker
- [CLARITY] Kuei Ping's decision to leave the compound feels somewhat sudden without deeper emotional setup in the current segment
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the wedding festivities to Kuei Ping's nighttime escape lacks a smooth connector

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
