Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "t'idu" (inconsistent capitalization, should be "T'idu" for consistency)
- [SPELLING] "statemeny" (typo, should be "statement")
- [SPELLING] "marrg" (typo, should be "marry")
- [SYNTAX] "the percentage of lamas is as great as among the Mongolians" (awkward phrasing, could be rephrased for clarity)
- [SPELLING] "tbem" (typo, should be "them")
- [SPELLING] "Rkomdjukb4" (appears to be a typo or formatting error, unclear what "b4" refers to)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the tribe's history and the detailed enumeration of "bones" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex and dense listing of "bones" and their characteristics without introductory context for unfamiliar readers.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from administrative divisions to customs and uses without a clear linking sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
