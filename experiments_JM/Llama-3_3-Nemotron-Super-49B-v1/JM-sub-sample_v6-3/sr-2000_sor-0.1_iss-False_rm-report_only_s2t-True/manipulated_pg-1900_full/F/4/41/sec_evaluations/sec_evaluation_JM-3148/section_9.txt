Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "waa", "hs", "anx", "sucb", "threr", "thouer", "eprings", "ajd", "Lyddu", "nrighbour", "thouer")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "had been growing, waiting, and waited for, perhaps, for years")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "quiver of the nostrils", "crisp seedcakes and raspberry shrub")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Lyddy's prayer to the poem and then to the new chapter without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., Lyddy's prayer, descriptions of Anthony's senses)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the intimate moment between Lyddy and Anthony to the broader, more casual gatherings feels somewhat disjointed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
