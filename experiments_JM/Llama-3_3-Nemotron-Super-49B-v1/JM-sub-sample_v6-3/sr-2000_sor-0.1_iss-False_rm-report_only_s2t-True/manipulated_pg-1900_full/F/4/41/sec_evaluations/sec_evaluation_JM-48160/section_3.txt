Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor typos (e.g., "sioent", "tpwn", "oeuvre" possibly intended as "oeuvres", "voutée" possibly a stylistic choice but stands out, "tuey" instead of "they", "ghe" instead of "the", "pêle-mêle" is correctly used but may cause reading pause for some)
- [LEXICON] Occasional word choice may cause slight pause (e.g., "sioent" if intended as "silent", "somber" for room description, "surging mass of soldiers" is vivid but slightly formal)
- [SYNTAX] One instance of slightly awkward sentence structure ("However, there was still the morrow and Bar-le-Duc.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from narrative to descriptive paragraph about Bar-le-Duc without clear transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in "the war zone which it took weeks of plotting..." (refers to reaching the zone, but could be slightly clearer)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt end of the section without concluding the narrative thread started (e.g., the anticipation of potentially spending time in a "cave" due to air raids)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
