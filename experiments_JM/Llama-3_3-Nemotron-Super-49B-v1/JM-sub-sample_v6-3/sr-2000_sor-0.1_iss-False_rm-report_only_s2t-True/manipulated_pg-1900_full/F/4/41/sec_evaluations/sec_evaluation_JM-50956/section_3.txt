- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russian actions alone dictated German strategy without fully considering other Allied efforts
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the Warsaw battle and introducing the chapter "New Opportunities for the Allies" without a clear link
- [CLARITY] Overly technical or assuming prior knowledge in some military strategy explanations (e.g., division numbers and movements)
