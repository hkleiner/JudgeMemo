1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "regehcy" (should be "regency"), "fhrough" (should be "through"), "innumerable tasks which incessant orders" (redundant "which"), "sebse" (should be "sense"), "wprk" (should be "work"), "Grom" (should be "From"), "sufferinh" (should be "suffering"), "ptoperty" (should be "property"), "ue" (should be "to" in "it is necessary uere"), "beint" (should be "being"), "instructionnand" (should be "instruction and"), "schkol" (should be "school"), "estavlished" (should be "established"), "shapemof" (should be "shape of"), "wkth" (should be "with"), "daye" (should be "day"), "constantly more urgent" (could imply increasing urgency over time, but clarity on what "more urgent" refers to is lacking)
- [GRAMMAR] "the single exception of the Sheep on the Seashore, which was the ptoperty of the Empress" (awkward phrasing), "I must at once add" (somewhat abrupt transition), "certain pictures brought speculative prices... even before they were finished" (sentence structure clarity), "the artist possessed anong her portfolios" (should be "among"), "all that she needed to do was to transfer them to her canvas" (implies ease, potentially misleading about the artist's process)
- [LEXICON] "purplish and cottony" (subjective criticism, not a fluency issue but notable for tone), "innumerable tasks" (could be more precise), "relieved of all outside interruption" (somewhat formal, but clear)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the art school to describing Rosa Bonheur's life at By without a clear connecting sentence, and from her work period to the war of 1870 (lacks transitional phrases for smooth flow)
- [CLARITY] "It is necessary uere to open a parenthesis" (archaic and unclear to modern readers without context), "the period of her art school" (could benefit from a clearer connection to the preceding narrative), "certain pictures... were done rapidly" (lacks clarity on what "rapidly" means in the context of her usual meticulous process)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Empress's visit to the discussion of the Universal Exposition of 1867 feels somewhat disconnected (needs a smoother link between events)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
