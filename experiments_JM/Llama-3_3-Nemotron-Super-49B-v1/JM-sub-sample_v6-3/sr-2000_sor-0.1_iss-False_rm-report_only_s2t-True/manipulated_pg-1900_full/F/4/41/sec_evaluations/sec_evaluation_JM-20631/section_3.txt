Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "altruism", "eugenists") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the Old Testament's ideal and the biological/sociological superiority of Jews could be more clearly justified.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from biblical analysis to the discussion of Jewish superiority and back to spiritual mission feels somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
