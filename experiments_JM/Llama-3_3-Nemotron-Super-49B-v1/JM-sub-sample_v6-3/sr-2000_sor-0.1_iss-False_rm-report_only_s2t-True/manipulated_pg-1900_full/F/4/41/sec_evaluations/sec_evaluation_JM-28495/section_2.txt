Evaluation Form:

- [SPELLING] "qhimpering" instead of "whimpering"
- [SPELLING] "ikpossible" instead of "impossible"

- [SPELLING] "ghe" instead of "the"
- [SPELLING] "onbearth" instead of "on earth"
- [SPELLING] "tnirteenth" instead of "thirteenth"
- [SPELLING] "panting" (inconsistent hyphenation not an issue, but "panting" is correctly used, however, "frightenwd" in previous segment is an error, yet it's not in the current segment to evaluate)
- [GRAMMAR] "I hasped" instead of "I gasped"
- [SPELLING] "frightenwd" is not in the current segment, error in previous segment

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the dog's name to describing its growth and behavior without a clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the scene at the pond to deciding on a name for the puppy without a connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The comparison between the puppy and Excalibur could be clearer for readers unfamiliar with the legend.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
