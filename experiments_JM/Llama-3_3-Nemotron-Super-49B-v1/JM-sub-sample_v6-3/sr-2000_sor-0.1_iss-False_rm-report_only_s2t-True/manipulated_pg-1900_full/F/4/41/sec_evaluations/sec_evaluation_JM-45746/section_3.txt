2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of the "TEACHERS' MEETINGS" chapter and the start of "MEETING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD" without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of listing specific English classics and their discussion outline, while illustrative, feels somewhat disconnected from the broader discussion on effective meeting strategies without explicit explanation of its general applicability.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing teacher meetings to the personal talk initiative, while related, could benefit from a smoother transition to enhance flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
