Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "oresided" (should be "presided"), "unpdubted" (should be "undoubted"), "waok" (should be "walk"), "anr" (should be "and"), "byvmaking" (should be "by making"), "establidhed" (should be "established"), "cdmtre" (should be "centre"), "Itvat" (should be "It was at"), "repfesenting" (should be "representing")
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., the paragraph starting with "The years which followed...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Rosa's childhood activities to the family's move and the revolution of 1830 (could benefit from a clearer connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] The introduction of Mlle. Micas feels somewhat disconnected from the surrounding narrative (briefly mentioning her significance earlier or after her introduction could enhance coherence)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
