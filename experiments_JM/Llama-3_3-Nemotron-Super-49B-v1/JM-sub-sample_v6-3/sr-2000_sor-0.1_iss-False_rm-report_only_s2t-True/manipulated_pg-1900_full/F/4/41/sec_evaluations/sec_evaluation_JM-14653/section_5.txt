Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "thks", "yo", "friennial", "daugnter", "omniscient" misspelled as "omniscisnce", "pwople", "thzt", "itcit", "effortlrss", "nukber", "fwults")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "You will perceive, if not at once, later, that you have bitten off just about as much as you can chew.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "bitten off just about as much as you can chew" is idiomatic but may not be universally clear in this context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that personal goodwill cultivation automatically benefits humanity without clear explanation
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs transition abruptly (e.g., from discussing society inefficiency to focusing on personal cultivation)
- [STRUCTURE] The section on children's perception feels somewhat tangential to the main argument until its later connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
