Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "ith" instead of "is", "Ttansfer" instead of "Transfer", "wsll" instead of "well", "unrerhanded" instead of "unrehearsed", "Eartggirl" instead of "Earthgirl", "thah" instead of "that", "thay" instead of "say", "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain", "ethpect" instead of "expect", "uth" instead of "us")
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some dialogue tags (e.g., "toldvhimself" should be "told himself")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "th-" substitutions for "th" sounds to indicate lisps, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramwr's mind" without prior context or explanation
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the spaceport scene to the Englanders' flat without a clear temporal or spatial bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
