- [SYNTAX] "the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in permanent form" (slightly awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "sneep" (should be "sheep"), "m√©nage" (used correctly but may require explanation for some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced artworks without introduction.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing "La Baigneuse" to stating "Millet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter" without a clear link.
- [STRUCTURE] The section on Millet's Early Life feels disconnected from the preceding artistic analysis without a transitional paragraph.
