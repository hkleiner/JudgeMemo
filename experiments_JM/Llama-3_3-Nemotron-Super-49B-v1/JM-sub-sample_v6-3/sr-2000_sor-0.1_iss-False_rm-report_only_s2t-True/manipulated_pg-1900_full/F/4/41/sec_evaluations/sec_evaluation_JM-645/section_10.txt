Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "jgnorance", "doormwas", "relevqnt", "thay", "vompensation", "ocassipn", "perioducals", "subjedt")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the figure in the carpet might take on another twist or two")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly complex for modern reading ("renannouncement", "gaolers")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Vereker's health and the narrator's reflection on Mrs. Corvick's independence
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly convoluted, requiring re-reading for understanding (e.g., "The writer might go down to his grave: she was the person in the world to whom—as if she had been his favoured heir—his continued existence was least of a need.")
- [TRANSITION] The jump from the immediate conversation to the narrator's future observations and expectations feels somewhat disconnected
