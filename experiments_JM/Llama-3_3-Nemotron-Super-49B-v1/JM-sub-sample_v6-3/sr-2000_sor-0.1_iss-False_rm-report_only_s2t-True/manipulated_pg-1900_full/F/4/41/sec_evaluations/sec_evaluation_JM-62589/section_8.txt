Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "sgowing", "frof", "aeary", "weaxry", "lkk", "tev", "nqpping", "dowm", "yku", "ah", "lsss", "pteveiled", "minhled", "tk", "frol", "shxll", "departsnto")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "something likr a sob mingled with the drum beats")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "thou", "thee", though contextually appropriate for the period setting)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the battle scene and the reflective moment by the campfire without clear temporal cues
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in "the story" Robert hopes to know (could be clarified for better understanding)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in tone from intense battle preparation to poetic reflection on the drummer's thoughts without smooth bridging

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
