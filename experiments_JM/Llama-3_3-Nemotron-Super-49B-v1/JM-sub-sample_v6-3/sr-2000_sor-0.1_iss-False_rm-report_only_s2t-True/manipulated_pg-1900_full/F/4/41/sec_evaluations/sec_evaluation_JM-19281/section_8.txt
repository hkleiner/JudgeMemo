Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "womrn", "fhe", "eisasters", "invasions" of incorrect words)
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are excessively long, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that unity is the sole root cause of global issues might not be fully convincing without additional evidence
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraph transitions could be smoother to enhance the narrative flow
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are densely packed with ideas, slightly obscuring the main point

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
