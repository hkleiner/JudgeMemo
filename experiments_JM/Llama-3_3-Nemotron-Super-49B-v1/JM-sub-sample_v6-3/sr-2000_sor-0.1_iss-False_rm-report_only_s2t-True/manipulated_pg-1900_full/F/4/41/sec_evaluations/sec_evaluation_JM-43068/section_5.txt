Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "nekd", "guikde", "utilised" (non-standard in American English, though correct in British), "wlrds", "xalled", "imagibed", "wnd")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It was during this short visit to his native country that he met his first wife, a Mlle. Ono, whose portrait he had painted.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "endeavoured", "thougt", "strenuous existence")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Millet's personal life and the broader political context of 1848
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the political situation in 1848 feels somewhat tangential and disrupts the focus on Millet's life
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of the struggle in Paris and the introduction of Barbizon in 1850

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
