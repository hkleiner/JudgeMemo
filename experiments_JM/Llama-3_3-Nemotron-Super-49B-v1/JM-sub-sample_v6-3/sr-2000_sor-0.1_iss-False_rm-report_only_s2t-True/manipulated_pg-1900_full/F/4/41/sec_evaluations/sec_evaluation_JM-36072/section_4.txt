- [SYNTAX] "It was the mausoleum of certain generous hopes." (somewhat abrupt transition, lacks clear connection to preceding sentence)
- [LEXICON] "enrag√©s of Europe" (assumes reader's familiarity, could benefit from brief explanation for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from discussing foreign politics to the Great Exhibition and then to literary movements without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "We have to remember that the prosperity and security of the happy time which we are now considering were due to temporary causes, which can never recur." feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate preceding and following content.
- [TRANSITION] The digression about Thomas Carlyle and the comparison of Victorian figures with contemporaries, while engaging, disrupts the flow from discussing literary movements to focusing on Tennyson.
- [LOGIC] The assertion about the Victorian era having more "magnificent types of the human countenance" than any since ancient Greece is subjective and lacks clear relevance to the preceding literary analysis.
