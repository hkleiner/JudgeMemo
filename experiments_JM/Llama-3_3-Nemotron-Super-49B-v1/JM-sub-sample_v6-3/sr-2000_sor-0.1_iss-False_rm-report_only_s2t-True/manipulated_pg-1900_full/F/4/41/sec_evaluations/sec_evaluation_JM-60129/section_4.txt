- [GRAMMAR] "the number of deaths still outnumber thembirths" (should be "outnumber births" or similar for clarity)
- [LEXICON] "croached" (likely should be "crouched")
- [SYNTAX] "It must be confessed that it resembled reeds more than grass and seemed better fit to be used as knitting needles than as food for cattle." (wordy, could be more concise)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the tribe's decline to the morning departure without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "Yellow Tanguts", "Kalmucks", "Tangutans", "Khirgis" without introduction.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the narrative of traveling to the descriptive passage about the landscape without a smooth transition.
