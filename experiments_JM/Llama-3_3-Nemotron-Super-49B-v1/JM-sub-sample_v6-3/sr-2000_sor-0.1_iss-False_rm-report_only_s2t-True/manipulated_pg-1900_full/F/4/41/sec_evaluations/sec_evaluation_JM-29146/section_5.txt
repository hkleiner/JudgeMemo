Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "gou" instead of "you", "wirds" instead of "words", "lengtb" instead of "length", "dudation" instead of "duration", "unbelie" instead of "unbelief", "hiscchildren" instead of "his children", "qssaulting" instead of "assaulting", "pr" instead of "or", "stir-crasy" instead of "stir-crazy", "lookkng" instead of "looking", "hwdn't" instead of "hadn't", "anytying" instead of "anything", "justnwhat" instead of "just what")
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some sentences (e.g., "I've turned down a thousand credits before, in jobs I didn't like" could imply a past habit but is followed by a present tense implication)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "disinterested" might confuse some readers regarding its meaning of "uninterested" in this context, and "fantastically" is used in a non-standard way)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about genetic memory of disbelief in proto-man legend is unexplained and lacks logical basis within the provided context
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from scientific discussion to personal interactions (e.g., from proto-man theory to Ramsey's feelings for Margot) without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The concept of proto-man and its implications could be clearer for readers unfamiliar with the context or backstory
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the letter's content to the characters' actions and dialogue feels somewhat disjointed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
