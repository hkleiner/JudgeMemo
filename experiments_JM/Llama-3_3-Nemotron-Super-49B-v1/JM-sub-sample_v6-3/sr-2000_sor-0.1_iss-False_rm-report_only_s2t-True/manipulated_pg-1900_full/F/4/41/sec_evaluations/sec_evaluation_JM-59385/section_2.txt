Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "stoox", "indulgejce", "rntered", "wasfe", "xacred", "humbel", "fuh", "waite", "arxngement", "suffocating" not present but "near to suffocation" is, "fingders")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the tenseness of the principalâ€™s voice", "the marvel of the opportunity")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common (e.g., "squandered your valuable time", "bowed out")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the memory of the mission school and the soothsayers' examination (could benefit from a clearer link)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or long, slightly hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the description of the soothsayers' process)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Kuei Ping's internal conflict to the detailed description of the wedding preparations feels somewhat disconnected
