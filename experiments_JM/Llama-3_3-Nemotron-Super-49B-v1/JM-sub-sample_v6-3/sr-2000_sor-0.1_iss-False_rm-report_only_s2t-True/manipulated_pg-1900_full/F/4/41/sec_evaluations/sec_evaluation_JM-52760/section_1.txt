Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "bpth" (should be "both"), "oate" (should be "late"), "Virgijia" (should be "Virginia"), "censuw" (should be "census"), "vdis" (should be "did"), "hsrd" (should be "hard")
- [SYNTAX] "the story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told" (somewhat abrupt transition)
- [LEXICON] "dierce" (should be "fierce"), "outfkank" (should be "outflank"), "petsistent" (should be "persistent"), "Confeferate" (should be "Confederate"), "Strdman" (should be "Stedman")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing the broader war strategy to focusing on Petersburg's details without a clear transitional sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "We must destroy this army of Grantâ€™s before he gets to James River..." could benefit from context on why this is crucial at this point.
- [TRANSITION] The move from Grant's decision after Cold Harbor to the description of Petersburg feels somewhat disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
