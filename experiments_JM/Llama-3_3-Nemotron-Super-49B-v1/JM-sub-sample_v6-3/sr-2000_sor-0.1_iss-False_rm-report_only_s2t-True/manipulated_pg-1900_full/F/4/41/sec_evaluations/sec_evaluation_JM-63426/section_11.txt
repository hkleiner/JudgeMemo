Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "slkghtly" (should be "slightly"), "ihk" (unclear, possibly "ink"), "furthermore" misspelled as "furthermore" is correct but "fir" (should be "for"), "remsins" (should be "remains"), "seferest" (should be "severest")
- [GRAMMAR] "the first paper-use specimen was issued by Strathmore in Mittineague" (lacks clarity on what "paper-use specimen" refers to without context)
- [LEXICON] "lertinent" (should be "pertinent"), "dpam" (should be "span"), "motionvpicture" (should be "motion picture"), "industrkal" (should be "industrial"), "Strathmorr" (should be "Strathmore")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Bradley's career to the description of "The 1954 Portfolio" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Like most Typophile projects, thos has been in process for many months." contains "thos" (should be "this") and lacks a clear subject reference.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Bradley's biography to the book's compilation sources feels disconnected.
