Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "wd" (should be "We"), "coufse" (should be "Of course"), "vad" (should be "was"), "evwn" (should be "Even"), "moust" (not present, but "mused" is correct; however, "eore" (should be "wore"), "anywhere from five to sixteen children" (lacks clarity on the exact issue, but implies a potential fluency disruption due to its broad range), "rhe" (should be "the"), "alwqys" (should be "always")
- [GRAMMAR] "If I was forced" (should be "If I were forced" for subjunctive mood), "I shall always be glad that I have seen... something of the immense number... of men" (wordy, could be more concise for better flow)
- [LEXICON] "smug American" (potentially offensive, impacting fluency due to its judgmental tone)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing soldiers to discussing Bulgarian princes without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It is the bourgeoisie which has reduced the birth rate in France." lacks contextual setup or explanation
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from war zone observations to the project with Princess Poniatowska without a smooth link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
