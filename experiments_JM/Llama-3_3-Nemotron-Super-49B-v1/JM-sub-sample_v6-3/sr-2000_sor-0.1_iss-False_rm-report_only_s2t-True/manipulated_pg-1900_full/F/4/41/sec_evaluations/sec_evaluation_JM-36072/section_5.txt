Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "severak", "amov", "disgracefuk", "muck-rake" contextually correct but "muckrake" is more common, "Oedipjs", "Miltkn", "thd", "eduvatedcclass")
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "scabrous", "muck-rake", "Pantisocracy")
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between topics (Tennyson's style, Victorian longevity, literary critiques, Tennyson's beliefs, and broader Victorian era reflections) without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume a high level of prior knowledge about referenced literary works and historical figures without brief contextualization
- [LOGIC] The connection between Tennyson's work and the broader societal commentary could be more explicitly stated in some sections

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
