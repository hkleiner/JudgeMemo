Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms (e.g., "sdlf-consciousness", "vulgar language") and less common vocabulary (e.g., "vehemence", "platonist") might require additional effort for comprehension.
- [SPELLING] Minor typos (e.g., "pauperising" should likely be "pauperizing", "sas" instead of "was", "tx" in "tk be", "rxther" instead of "rather", "makibg" instead of "making") detract from perfection.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between discussing the working class, literary responses, and philosophical critiques without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge (e.g., specifics of the Hammonds' books, details of Plato's texts) might confuse those unfamiliar with the references.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from economic analysis to literary figures (Carlyle, Ruskin) without a bridging statement.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
