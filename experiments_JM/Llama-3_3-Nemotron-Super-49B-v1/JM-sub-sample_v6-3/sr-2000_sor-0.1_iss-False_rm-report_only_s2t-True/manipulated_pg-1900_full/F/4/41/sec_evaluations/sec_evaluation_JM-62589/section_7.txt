Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "vare" instead of "bare", "anf" instead of "and", "nrar" instead of "near", "thdir" instead of "their", "unhis" instead of "within", "lisery" instead of "misery", "frautht" instead of "fraught", "ghe" instead of "the", "withun" instead of "within")
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some sentences
- [LEXICON] Occasionally awkward word choice (e.g., "lisery" error aside, "painful task" is clear but "fainting strength" could be more idiomatic)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Robert's reflection to the encounter with Washington without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, slightly hindering immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
