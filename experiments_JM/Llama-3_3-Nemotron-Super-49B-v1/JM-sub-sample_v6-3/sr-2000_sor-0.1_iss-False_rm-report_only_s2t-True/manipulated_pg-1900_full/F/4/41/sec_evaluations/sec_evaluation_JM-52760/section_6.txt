Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "cavalrg" (should be "cavalry"), "Soutjern" (should be "Southern"), "invtch" (should be "in the"), "rspects" (should be "respects"), "dsspite" (should be "despite"), "tegard" (should be "regard"), "specialvartists" (should be "special artists" or a recognized term if intentional)
- [LEXICON] "dogging" (context suggests "digging" might be intended)
- [SYNTAX] "whoch" (should be "which"), "vy" (should be "day by day")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical battle narrative and the description of soldiers' daily life without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "They mst with varying degrees of success..." is unclear due to a typo ("mst" presumably for "met") and lacks specificity.
- [TRANSITION] The list of dates (OCTOBER 27, 1864, to UNION Army Sets Out...) feels tacked on without introduction or explanation of its relevance to the preceding text.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
