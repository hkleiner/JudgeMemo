Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "soldiet" (should be "soldier"), "wuoted" (should be "quoted"), "sr" (should be "the"), "hsr" (should be "her"), "atras" (implied, should be "across"), "min" (should be "in"), "sajned" (should be "says"), "thir" (should be "their"), "tr" (should be "the")
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia lies in seas of blood and tears" (idiomatic awkwardness), "the number of casualties is latger" (should be "larger")
- [LEXICON] "enormohs sacrifices" (should be "enormous"), "self-sacrificing services to humanity" (somewhat vague)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russia's role is underappreciated without direct comparison to others' contributions in the second chapter.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing casualties to the impact of Russia's actions on the war's outcome without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., the explanation of Russia's impact on German troop movements).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
