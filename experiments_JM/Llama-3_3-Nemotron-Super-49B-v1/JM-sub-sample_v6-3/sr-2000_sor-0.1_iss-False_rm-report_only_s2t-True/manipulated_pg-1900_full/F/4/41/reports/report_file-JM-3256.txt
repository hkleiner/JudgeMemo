    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasional complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Non-linear narrative with anecdotes that, while illustrative, slightly disrupt the linear exploration of "bookman" definition
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumed knowledge of literary references (e.g., Elia, Spenser, Chaucer) might confuse less literate readers

        • Assumptions about shared knowledge of various authors and their works might confuse readers unfamiliar with the referenced literature.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, particularly from the discussion of literary critiques to the bookman's personal preferences and back to broader literary themes.
