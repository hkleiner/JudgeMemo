Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "neihnourhood" (should be "neighbourhood"), "splwndid" (should be "splendid"), "paonting" (should be "painting"), "lont" (should be "long"), "traditkonalists" (should be "traditionalists"), "Rhe de Jouy" (should be "Rue de Jouy"), "damnatory" (uncommon, but not incorrect; however, "exploded" is an odd choice of verb)
- [SYNTAX] "with stumbling fingers, upon the laborious mission which was dsstined to cease only with his life." (minor punctuation or wording adjustment for clarity could enhance flow)
- [LEXICON] "lumbering and trammelled flight" (somewhat archaic or less common phrasing, though not incorrect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to his birth and early life without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Are we at liberty to attribute..." and its following paragraph could be more directly connected to the narrative flow or made more clearly speculative.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the anecdote about Meissonier's insistence on realism to the historical context of French art feels somewhat disconnected without a smoother transition.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
