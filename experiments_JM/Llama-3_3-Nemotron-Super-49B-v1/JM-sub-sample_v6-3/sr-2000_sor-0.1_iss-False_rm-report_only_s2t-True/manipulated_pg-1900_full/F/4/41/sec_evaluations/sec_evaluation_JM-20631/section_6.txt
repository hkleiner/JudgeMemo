Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", in quoted texts) might require additional interpretation time.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing England's historical expansion and comparing its mission evolution to Israel's could be more explicitly connected.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from analyzing "Rule, Britannia" to introducing Kipling's spiritualization of the Chosen People doctrine.
