Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "What, then, becomes of the scientific conception of energy? ...")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "xmudgy", "jnstinctive" - assuming typos, if not, [SPELLING])
- [SPELLING] Potential typos (e.g., "xmudgy", "jnstinctive", "teh" - assuming not intentional)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning in the discussion of "energy" and "cause" (e.g., looping back to Spencerian concepts without clear resolution)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between criticizing Spencer and defining "effective" relations (e.g., paragraph breaks without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in distinguishing between "Source", "force", and "cause" without clear, concise definitions upfront

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
