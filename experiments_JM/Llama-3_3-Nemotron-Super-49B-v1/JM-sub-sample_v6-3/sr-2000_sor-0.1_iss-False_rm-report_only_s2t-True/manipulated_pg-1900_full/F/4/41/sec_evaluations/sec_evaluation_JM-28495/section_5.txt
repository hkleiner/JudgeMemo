Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "slways", "steetched", "forgivijg", "Excapibur", "wqs", "swt", "ssparately", "coram populo" typo not present but "coram populo" is correctly used, however, "collqrs" is incorrect)
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It was quite impossible to move Excalibur once he had decided to remain where he was")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading ("coram populo", "exhausting, for he loathed exercise of every kind")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Excalibur's adventures to the curate and Eileen's serious conversation without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, slightly hindering immediate understanding
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between Excalibur's perspective and the humans' conversation without a clear narrative bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
