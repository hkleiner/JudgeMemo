Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "populabn" (likely "popular"), "tk" (likely "to"), "huj" (likely "how"), "lropose" (likely "propose"), "plwasantly" (likely "pleasantly"), "roxburghe" (correct, but rare; assuming typo for "Roxburghe"), "favoyrable" (likely "favourable"), "arf" (likely "art"), "hjs" (likely "his"), "depaptment" (likely "department"), "inconsequence" (contextually unclear, possibly "inconsistently" or intentional poetic license)
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially hindering immediate clarity (e.g., the paragraph discussing the bookman's preferences).
- [LEXICON] "inconsequence" (as mentioned, unclear; assuming a typo or poetic license, but it disrupts flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing specific books, the characteristics of a "bookman," and philosophical views on literature without clear transitional phrases, making the flow somewhat disjointed.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about shared knowledge of various authors and their works might confuse readers unfamiliar with the referenced literature.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, particularly from the discussion of literary critiques to the bookman's personal preferences and back to broader literary themes.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
