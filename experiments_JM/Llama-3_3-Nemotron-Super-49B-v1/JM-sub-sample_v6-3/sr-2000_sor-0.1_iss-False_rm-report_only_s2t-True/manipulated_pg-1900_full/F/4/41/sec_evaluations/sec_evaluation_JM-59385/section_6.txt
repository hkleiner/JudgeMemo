Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "thxt", "mpst", "ttadesman", "conwul", "fsear", "inbthe", "forw", "freedom" misspelled as "freesom")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the poison of selfish despair did its work upon the heart of Kuei Ping")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common (e.g., "haggled", "faggots", "hutungs", "Hatamen Street" without context for unfamiliar readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Kuei Ping's departure preparations to her watching the city awaken (could benefit from a clearer link)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of characters' past actions and settings (e.g., Miss Porter, the western Bible, without brief reminders for context)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in Kuei Ping's emotional state from seeking freedom to finding joy through self-forgetfulness (feels somewhat rushed)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
