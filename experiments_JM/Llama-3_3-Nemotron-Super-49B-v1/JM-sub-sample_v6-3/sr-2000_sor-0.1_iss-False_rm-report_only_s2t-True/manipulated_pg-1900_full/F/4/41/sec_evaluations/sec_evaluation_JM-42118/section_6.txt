- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Wit and ruthless fatuity were the order of the day; these folk were wondrous full of the neatly turned phrase and the polished epigram.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading ("thou", "t'was", "ay", etc.), potentially affecting flow for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between discussing Fragonard's art and the political/historical context (e.g., the shift from "La Chanteuse" to Boucher's death and then to political intrigue).
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and paragraphs that may confuse readers due to dense historical and artistic references without clear connections.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, making the text feel somewhat disjointed.
