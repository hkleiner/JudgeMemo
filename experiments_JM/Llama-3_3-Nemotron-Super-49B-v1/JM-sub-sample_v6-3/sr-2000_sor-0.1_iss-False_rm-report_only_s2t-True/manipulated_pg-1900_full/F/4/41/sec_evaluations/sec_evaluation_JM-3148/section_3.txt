Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "wjere" (should be "where"), "unobjectionable" (repeatedly used, may be intended but notable for its rarity), "nuisances" (not present, but "dajgerous", "be ruinex" indicate potential inconsistency in typo severity)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., the long, descriptive passages)
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sentry-bird", "freaks of nature") might challenge some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the quoted text to the narrative about Anthony's development (e.g., the poem excerpts feel somewhat disconnected without clearer thematic linkage)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or dense with information, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the description of wood preparation)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Anthony's personal growth to the teacher's comment feels somewhat abrupt

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
