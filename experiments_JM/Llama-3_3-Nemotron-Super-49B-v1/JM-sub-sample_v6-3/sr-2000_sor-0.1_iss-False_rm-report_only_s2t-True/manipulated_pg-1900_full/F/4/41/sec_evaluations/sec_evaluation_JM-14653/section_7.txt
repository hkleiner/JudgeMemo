- [LOGIC] Assumption that all real motives are selfish without clear justification within the text
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Christmas to the reaction between Christmas and New Year without a clear connector
- [CLARITY] Philosophical concepts (e.g., the nature of ideals and self-conceit) could be more clearly explained for a general audience
