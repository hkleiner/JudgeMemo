Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "irrdgular", "mpre", "vibrztion", "cild", "xn", "drqstic", "autust", "fwmily", "q son")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Noiselessly she slid the bar and stood without the compound." feels slightly disconnected)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common (e.g., "thither", "gracikus"), potentially affecting smooth reading for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shift from Kuei Ping's emotional state to the introduction of Chang An) without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] A few instances where character actions or motivations could be more clearly explained (e.g., the full context of Chang An's arrival is somewhat assumed)
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between time periods (e.g., from daily life to the birth of the child) could be smoother

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
