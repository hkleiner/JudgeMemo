Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "unfamiliwr" (likely "unfamiliar")
- [GRAMMAR] "Raksey's" (inconsistent name spelling, should be "Ramsey's")
- [LEXICON] "libidinal vitality" (potentially confusing for some readers due to its specificity and formality)
- [SYNTAX] "You make a girl blush." (informal, somewhat jarring in an otherwise formal sci-fi context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Margot's sudden departure without clear motivation or foreshadowing
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the apartment exploration to finding a letter with significant plot implications
- [CLARITY] The letter's content (proto-men, hyper-space pattern significance) is introduced without sufficient context for immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
