Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "intelkectual", "vAmerica", "wjth", "ezch", "endmin", "indulgejce", "hds")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading (e.g., "thou", not present but overall tone)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to the memory of the mission school (could benefit from a clearer connector)
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly long or convoluted, slightly hindering immediate understanding (e.g., the description of Kuei Ping's thoughts on the pearls)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
