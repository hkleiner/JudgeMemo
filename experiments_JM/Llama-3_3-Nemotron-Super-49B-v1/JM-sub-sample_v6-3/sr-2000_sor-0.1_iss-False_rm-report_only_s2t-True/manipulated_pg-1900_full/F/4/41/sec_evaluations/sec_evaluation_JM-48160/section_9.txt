- [GRAMMAR] "any one who is kind enough to answer this appeal with a donation will please send it there" (could be more concise, e.g., "Please send donations to..."), "I had gone to France to write about the work of its women in the war and in the hope of doing something for that great country in my own way, but with the firm intention of not being drawn into any organization" (long, convoluted sentence), "how sad abtarrying place they are" (should be "how sad a barren place it is")
- [LEXICON] "abtarrying" (should be "barren"), "enough that they are delicacies, not luxuries" (slightly informal in a formal context), "youse" (not present, but "yhose" should be "those")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers understand the significance of the Battle of the Marne without brief context.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing hospital conditions to the importance of the French military genius at the Marne.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph starting with "Military discipline is inexorable").
