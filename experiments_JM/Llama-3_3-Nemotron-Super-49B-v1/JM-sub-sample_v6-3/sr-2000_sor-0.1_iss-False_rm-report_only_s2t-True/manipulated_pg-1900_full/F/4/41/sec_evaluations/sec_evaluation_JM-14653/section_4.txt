- [SYNTAX] "Of course, excess usually exacts its toll, within twenty-four hours, especially from the weak." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that "excess in moderation and dignity" is universally understood and accepted without explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the benefits of feasting to critiquing a hypothetical alternative festival without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph starting "He who girds at an ancient established festival..." could benefit from clearer structuring to enhance the flow of ideas.
