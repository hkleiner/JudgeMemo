Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling errors (e.g., "mrmbers", "Johnaon", "sezsore", "centrr", "calculatedly" not present but "calculated" is, "cevntury" not present but "century" is, etc.)
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the crowds that thronged the studio? Certainly mere words cannot picture the scenes thatbthe old house in Leicester Square witnessed in those stirring times." - missing conjunction or transition)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "faut pas", "sezshore", though this might be intentional for the subject matter)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the Royal Academy's formation and Sir Joshua's personal achievements/experiences without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the final paragraph discussing regrets over Reynolds' use of pigments).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially when shifting from historical context to personal biography and back.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
