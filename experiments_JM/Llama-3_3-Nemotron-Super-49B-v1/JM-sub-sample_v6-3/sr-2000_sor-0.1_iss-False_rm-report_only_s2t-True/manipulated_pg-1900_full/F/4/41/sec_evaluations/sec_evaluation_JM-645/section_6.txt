Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "thd", "cirvumstances", "reqiires", "hjm", "tl", "ssparation", "hs")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structure (e.g., "I had taken to the man still more than I had ever taken to the books.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading (e.g., "sating", "reproaching")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in topic from Corvick's journey to the narrator's feelings about Vereker without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Corvick's assignment to the narrator's past interactions with Vereker) can be disorienting
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or convoluted, hindering immediate understanding (e.g., "For the few persons, at any rate, abnormal or not, with whom my anecdote is concerned...")
