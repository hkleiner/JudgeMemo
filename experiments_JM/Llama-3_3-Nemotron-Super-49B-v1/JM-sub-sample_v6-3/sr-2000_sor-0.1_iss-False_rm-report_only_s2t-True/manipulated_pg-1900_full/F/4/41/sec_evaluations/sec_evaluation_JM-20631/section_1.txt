Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "whosw", "tye", "Twdnty-one", "orose", "volymes", "wholw", "ztudent", "kur", "ayain", "somerhing", "dslivered")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "in our own day", "has provided our enemies with a new weapon" could be more smoothly integrated)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-specialist readers (e.g., "recondite", "revivifying")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Arthur Davis to broader religious language examples without clear transitional phrase
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt move from Hebrew's revival to discussing Germanism and Judaism without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are lengthy and complex, potentially reducing clarity for casual readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
