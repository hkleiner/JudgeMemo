Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple typos (e.g., "anytying", "thoyghts", "jusnwhat", "frkm", "capsjle", "mosr", "perfectlycstill", "bewutiful", "tue")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "at the top--who would crave isolation at the top?", "For Irwadi, yes, he was thinking. Certainly for Orwadi.")
- [LEXICON] Informal tone inconsistencies (e.g., "lisped" used in a formal context without clear narrative justification)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from Ramsey/Margot/Vardin's storyline to Garr Symm's internal monologue without a clear narrative bridge
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the group's actions in the Graveyard and the detailed, separate plot development with Garr Symm and Ramar Chind
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and plot points (e.g., the significance of the letter, Garr Symm's ultimate goal) could be more clearly introduced or foreshadowed within this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
