Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "sooj" (likely "soon"), "tjat" (likely "that"), "v" (likely "to" or "of"), "qt" (likely "at"), "nephew" implied but "brother-in-law" used inconsistently.
- [GRAMMAR] "zre" (likely "are"), "grief on the occasion" (awkward phrasing), "men of his type" (vague).
- [LEXICON] "delated" (likely "related" or "allied"), "scrificed" (likely "sacrificed"), "unrest caused by his measures" (slightly unclear).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Tushratta's letters to Napkhuria's accession without clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological jump between describing Tushratta's situation and introducing Napkhuria's actions.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge (e.g., "Oriental seclusion", "supports of his throne").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
