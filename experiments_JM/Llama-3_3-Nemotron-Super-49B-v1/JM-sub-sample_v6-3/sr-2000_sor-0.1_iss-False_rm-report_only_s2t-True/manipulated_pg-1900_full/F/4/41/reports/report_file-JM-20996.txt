    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "have furnished the material for this book" (passive voice, though not incorrect, could be more engaging), "Our ship was now under way" (sudden shift in subject focus without clear connection), "Late in the afternoon..." (abrupt scene change without transitional phrase), "We were alone" (feels disconnected from the preceding sentence)
    - [LEXICON]:

    - [LOGIC]:
