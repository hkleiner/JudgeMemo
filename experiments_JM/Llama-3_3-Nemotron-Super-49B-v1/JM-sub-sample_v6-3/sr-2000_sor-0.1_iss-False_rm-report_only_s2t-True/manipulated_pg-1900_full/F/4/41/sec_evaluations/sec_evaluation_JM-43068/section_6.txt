Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward sentence structures (e.g., "The sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in constant fear of thebbrokers.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise or contemporary (e.g., "beneath his little abode a large garden stretched away almost to the fringe of the forest itself" could be more concise)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Millet's life and artwork without clear transitional phrases, causing slight disjointedness.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are overly complex or contain too much information, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the paragraph detailing the sale history of "The Angelus").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
