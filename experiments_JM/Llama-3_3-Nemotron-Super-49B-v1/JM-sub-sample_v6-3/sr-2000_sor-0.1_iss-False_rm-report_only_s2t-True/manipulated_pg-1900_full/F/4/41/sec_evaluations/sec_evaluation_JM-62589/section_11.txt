Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "at lastbthe" (typo: "at last the"), "wbere" (typo: "where"), "onxe agajn" (typo: "once again"), "formmhad" (typo: "had formed"), "safeyy" (typo: "safety")
- [SYNTAX] "the glory is beginning" (could imply an unclear reference without context, though understandable in this standalone segment)
- [LEXICON] "troublous" (archaic, may affect readability for some readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Washington's scene to "A week later" without a clear narrative bridge (though common in episodic structures)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge about "the glory" and its significance to Debby (minor, as context can be inferred)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in tone and scene without transitional phrases (e.g., from emotional reunion to Doctor Bell's confession)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
