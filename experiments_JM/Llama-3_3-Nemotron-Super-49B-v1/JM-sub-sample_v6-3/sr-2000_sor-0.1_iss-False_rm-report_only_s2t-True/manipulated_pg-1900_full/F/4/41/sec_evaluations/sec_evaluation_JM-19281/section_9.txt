Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "abwndonment" (should be "abandonment"), "ans" (should be "and"), "mnihilistic" (should be "nihilistic"), "leadefship" (should be "leadership"), "servicbthat" (should be "service that")
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede readability for some readers
- [LEXICON] Occasionally overly formal or less common vocabulary (e.g., "paradoxically but necessarily", "insistent self", "unconstrained") might reduce accessibility

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing evil and the importance of unity without clear linking
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it hard to discern the main point at first read
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the general discussion of evil to the specific topic of Covenant-breaking feels somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
