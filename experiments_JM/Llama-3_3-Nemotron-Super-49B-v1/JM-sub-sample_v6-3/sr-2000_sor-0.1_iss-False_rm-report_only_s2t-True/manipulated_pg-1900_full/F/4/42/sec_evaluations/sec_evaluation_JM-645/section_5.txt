Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "he had am free" (should be "he had been free")
- [SPELLING] "succour" (commonly spelled as "succor" in American English, though "succour" is acceptable in British English)
- [SYNTAX] "the reason of his note to me had been that he really didnâ€™t want to give us a grain of succour" (somewhat convoluted)
- [LEXICON] "envenomed my doubts" (uncommon phrasing, may cause slight pause)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about Corvick's future success without clear evidence
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from describing Vereker's character to Corvick's pursuit without a clear transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] The analogy of the chess game, while vivid, slightly obscures the direct narrative flow for a moment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
