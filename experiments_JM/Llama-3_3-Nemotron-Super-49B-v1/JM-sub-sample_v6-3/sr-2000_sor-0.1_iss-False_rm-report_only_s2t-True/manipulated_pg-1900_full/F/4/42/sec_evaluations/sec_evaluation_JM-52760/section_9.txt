Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "kill" instead of "killed" (in "at least 42,000 Union soldiers had been kill")
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward phrasing in "the Petersburg campaign had been turned by him into a form of relentless attrition"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the fall of Petersburg to the broader outcome of the war without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Although the northern forces had lost more men than their opponents, they had been able to replenish them more readily." feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate context of Petersburg's fall

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
