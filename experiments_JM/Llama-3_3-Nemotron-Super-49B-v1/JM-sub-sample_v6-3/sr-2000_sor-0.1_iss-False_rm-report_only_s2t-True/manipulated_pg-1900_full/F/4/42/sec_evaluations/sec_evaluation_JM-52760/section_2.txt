Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "which lead south" (should be "led")
- [SPELLING] "am given" (should be "were given")
- [SYNTAX] "the damage done by such raids was quickly patched up" (somewhat awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden transition from describing Petersburg's importance to the start of the Battle of Petersburg without a clear connecting sentence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods (e.g., spring 1862, June 1864, June 15-18) without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
