Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structures in dialogue (e.g., "Treated me wuss'n a dog")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquialisms and slang (e.g., "wuss'n", "yer", "hoits") may hinder readability for some readers
- [SPELLING] Consistent use of non-standard spellings for dialect (e.g., "wot", "dat") which, while stylistic, may cause initial confusion

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the boy's anger to sadness without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of new characters (e.g., Benny, Happy Jack) without prior context
- [CLARITY] The boy's backstory and motivations could be more clearly integrated into the narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
