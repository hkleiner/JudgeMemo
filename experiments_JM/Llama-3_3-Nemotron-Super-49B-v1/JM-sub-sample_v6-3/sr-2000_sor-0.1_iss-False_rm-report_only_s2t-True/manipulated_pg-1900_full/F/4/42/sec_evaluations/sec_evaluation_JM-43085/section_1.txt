Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "we was" (subject-verb agreement error, e.g., "we were")
- [LEXICON] "lumbering and trammelled flight" (archaic or less common phrasing may hinder smooth reading for some)
- [SPELLING] "bear" (should be "born")
- [SYNTAX] "It is true that, by way of ransom, he spent much time..." (awkward transition)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about maternal influence on artistic vocation feels speculative and slightly disrupts the narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from discussing Meissonier's early life to the broader art movement context without clear transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It is true that, by way of ransom, he spent much time..." is unclear in its intent and connection to the preceding text

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
