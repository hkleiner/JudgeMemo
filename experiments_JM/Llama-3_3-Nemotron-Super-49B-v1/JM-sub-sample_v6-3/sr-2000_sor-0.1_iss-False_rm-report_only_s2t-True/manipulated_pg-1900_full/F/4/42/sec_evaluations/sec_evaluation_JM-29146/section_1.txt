Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "it was rumored... he couldn't return to Earth because of some crime he **have** committed." (Subject-verb agreement error: "have" should be "had")
- [SPELLING] "thith", "thurrender", "ecth-captain", etc. (Intentional lisp portrayal, but affects fluency for some readers)
- [LEXICON] "planetarithed" (Uncommon word choice, may cause pause)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts without clear transition.
- [CLARITY] The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
