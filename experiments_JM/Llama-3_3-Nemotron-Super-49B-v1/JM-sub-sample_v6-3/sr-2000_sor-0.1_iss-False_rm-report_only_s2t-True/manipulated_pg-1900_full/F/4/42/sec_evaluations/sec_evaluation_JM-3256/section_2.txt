Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gossip Pepys", "whimsical, discursive") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between various literary references without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of numerous literary works and authors may alienate readers unfamiliar with the references.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
