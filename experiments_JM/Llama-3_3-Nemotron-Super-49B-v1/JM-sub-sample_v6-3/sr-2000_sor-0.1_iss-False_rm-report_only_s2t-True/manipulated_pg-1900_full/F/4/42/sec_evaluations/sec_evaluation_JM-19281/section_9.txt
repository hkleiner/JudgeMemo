Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "nethermost", "unconstrained") might require additional effort for general readers.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "was" instead of "were" in "...because they was evidence..." and "grew" instead of "grow" in "...the Bahá'í community to grew...".

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between discussing evil, unity, and the Bahá'í Cause's role without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making it hard to discern the main point without close attention.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion to organizational growth strategies without a clear link.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
