Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was" and "had" in close proximity without clear temporal distinction)
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("yaller bone-heap", "git me wits tergedder") may affect readability for some audiences
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spellings for dialect/emphasis (e.g., "tergedder", "scart") without clear contextual justification

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from mail route narrative to mine collapse without clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression within the segment (jumps between Ches's actions and reflections without smooth transitions)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in initial description of the tunnel collapse's cause and effects

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
