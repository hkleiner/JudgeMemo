Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slight awkwardness in "She was clinging with both hands to the collar of an enormous dog. Its tongue lolled..." (quick transition from Eileen's action to the dog's description)
- [LEXICON] "curvilinear attitude" might be overly complex for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Humorous assumption that "ladies did not wear pockets" feels slightly forced
- [CLARITY] Brief, potential confusion when Eileen says "in" instead of "up" (quickly resolved)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
