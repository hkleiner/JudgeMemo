Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "am filled" (should be "were filled")
- [SPELLING] "at last." (inconsistent punctuation usage throughout, but this one stands out due to abruptness without a clear narrative pause)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of passive voice in some sections (e.g., "were laid", "was laid")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Kuei Ping's story to the narrator's experience without a clear transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] The narrator's integration into Kuei Ping's life feels somewhat convenient and lacks detailed buildup
- [TRANSITION] The leap from discussing the school and church to the narrator's encounter with Kuei Ping as a teacher is jarring

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
