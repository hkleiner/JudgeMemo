Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I'm went to" (should be "I'm gone" or "I'm through")
- [SPELLING] "prospected" (should be "prospected" is incorrect in this context, likely meant "prospecting" or a similar term)
- [LEXICON] "snaking over that fall" (could be clarified for non-domain readers, though contextually understandable)
- [SYNTAX] "You was bound to help your pardner" (informal, but consistent with character voice; minor)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from emotional reunion to practical chores without transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] Assumption of reader familiarity with "Uncle Sammy" and "the inspector" without context
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of the letter without preceding emotional setup within this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
