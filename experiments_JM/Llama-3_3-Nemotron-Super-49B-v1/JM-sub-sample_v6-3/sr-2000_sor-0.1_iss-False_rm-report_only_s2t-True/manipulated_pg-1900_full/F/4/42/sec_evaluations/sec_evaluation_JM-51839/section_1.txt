Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, poetic language may impede immediate understanding for non-specialist readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "homsun centaurs", "spilled wine and scattered musk") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic verse to historical narrative without clear connective tissue.
- [CLARITY] Some historical references (e.g., "the seven cities of the Cibolo") assume prior knowledge for full clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
