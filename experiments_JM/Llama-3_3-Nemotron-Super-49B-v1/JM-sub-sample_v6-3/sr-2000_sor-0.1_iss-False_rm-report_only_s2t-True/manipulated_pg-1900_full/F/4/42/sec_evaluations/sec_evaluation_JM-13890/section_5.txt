Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "coulded burn" (incorrect verb form, should be "could burn")
- [LEXICON] "unwholesome concourse" (archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers)
- [SPELLING] "was a bearer of the great iron-bound chest... Henry III. was present, but he was not old enough to was" (repetition of "was" and incorrect sentence structure)
- [GRAMMAR] "...woulded have saved it" (incorrect verb form, should be "would have saved")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical events and architectural descriptions without clear connectors.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences (e.g., the final paragraph of the section) may confuse readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal markers between centuries (e.g., jumping from 1220 to 1378 without transitional phrases).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
