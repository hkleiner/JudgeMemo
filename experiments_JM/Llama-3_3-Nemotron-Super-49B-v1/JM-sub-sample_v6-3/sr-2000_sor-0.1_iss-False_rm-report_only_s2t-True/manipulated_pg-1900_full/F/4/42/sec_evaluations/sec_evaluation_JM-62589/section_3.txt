Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "woulded", "coulded", "wasn't" in some contexts feels out of place with the period language)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may impede smooth reading for modern audiences (e.g., "woned", "you'dsed", "you'lled")
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spellings for emphasis or dialect (e.g., "woned", "you'lled") - while stylistic, may cause minor pauses

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's decision to the introduction of Chapter IV without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Assumption of external context (e.g., the significance of George Washington, the situation at Prospect Hill) without sufficient in-text explanation for new readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in protagonist focus from Debby to "Robert Shirtliffe" (Debby in disguise) without clear narrative signaling

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
