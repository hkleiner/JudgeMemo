Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "receive" should be "received" (subject-verb agreement)
- [SPELLING] "turn" should be "turned" (correct past tense)
- [LEXICON] "draw and twisted" could be more clearly expressed (clarity in description)
- [SYNTAX] "I could was almost instantly overcome" (inconsistent verb usage, likely "could have been" intended)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from danger to a successful second attempt without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt move from describing the leper colony visit to the "Hike" chapter without a connecting element
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the first unsuccessful visit's detailed description is somewhat unclear in relation to the overall narrative arc

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
