Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "If Corvick had broken down I should never know; no one would be of any use if _he_ wasnâ€™t.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "out-Herod", "priggishness")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few instances (e.g., "had taken" to "have taken" in similar contexts)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Corvick's journey to the analogy with gamblers at Monte Carlo
- [CLARITY] The depth of emotional and intellectual investment in "the game of skill" could be more clearly introduced for new readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in focus from Corvick's personal life to the telegram without a clear connecting phrase

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
