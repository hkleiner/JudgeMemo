Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "she have prepared")
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic language may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but overall tone)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly hinder flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between poetic interludes and narrative
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations and emotional shifts could be more explicitly stated for clarity
- [TRANSITION] The leap from the festival to the years passing ("The years that followed...") feels somewhat abrupt

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
