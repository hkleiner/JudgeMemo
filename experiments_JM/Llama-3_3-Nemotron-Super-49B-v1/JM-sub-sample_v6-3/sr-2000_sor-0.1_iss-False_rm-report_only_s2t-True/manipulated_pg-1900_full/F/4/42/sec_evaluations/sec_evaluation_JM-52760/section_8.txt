Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "desperateness") might slightly hinder readability for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing the Battle of Five Forks to the Fall of Petersburg/Richmond could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different battle fronts (Five Forks, Petersburg, Richmond) without clear transitional phrases.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
