Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Having at length committed ourselves to the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as breed, sex, and age.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase discussions, and the quest for the Lost Dogs' Home, which, while mostly coherent, could benefit from smoother transitions
- [CLARITY] The humor in the boy's response and the decision to follow the official could be more clearly set up for immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
