Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "c. As a professional leader." ( abrupt section start without clear transition)
- [SPELLING] "couldnot" (missing hyphen or space in "could not")
- [SYNTAX] "The best evidence that a principal can show that he wishes to help the teacher is really to helped her" (incorrect verb form "helped" instead of "help")
- [LEXICON] Overly formal tone in some sections (e.g., "coupled with the need of interpretation") may impede smooth reading for some audiences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing teacher support to "CHAPTER: THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY" without a clear link
- [STRUCTURE] Subsections (e.g., "II. In an administrative way.") feel somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative examples
- [CLARITY] The example of the algebra teacher, while illustrative, disrupts the flow of the discussion on principal-teacher relationships
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs, especially when moving from specific examples back to general advice

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
