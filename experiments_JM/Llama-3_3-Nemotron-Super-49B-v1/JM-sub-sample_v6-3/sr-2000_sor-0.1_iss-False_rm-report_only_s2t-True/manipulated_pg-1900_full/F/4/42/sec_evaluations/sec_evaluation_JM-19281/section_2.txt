Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "inasmuch", "patrimony") 
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "has bring" instead of "has brought")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that materialism's failure directly leads to spiritual search without explicit connection 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing materialism to introducing global integration without a clear link 
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear, concise topic sentence, making focus unclear 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
