Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "potatow-noses" (likely "potato-noses" or more accurately, "potato-shaped noses")
- [LEXICON] "antediluvian type" (while correct, may be less familiar to some readers, potentially disrupting flow)
- [SYNTAX] "A true Finnish turned up nose, with an insignificant bridge was to was seen" (redundant "was to")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from describing daily life to discussing physical appearance without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Or perhaps they appeared relatively less shy..." could be more clearly connected to the preceding thought for better flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
