Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SPELLING] "coulded" (incorrect past tense of "could")
- [SYNTAX] "the greater resources at the command of the Lincoln administration were beginning to count more heavily with each passing day" (slightly awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the war's broader strategy to the specifics of Petersburg's importance without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The shift in focus from military strategy to the description of Petersburg's layout and infrastructure could be smoother for better flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
