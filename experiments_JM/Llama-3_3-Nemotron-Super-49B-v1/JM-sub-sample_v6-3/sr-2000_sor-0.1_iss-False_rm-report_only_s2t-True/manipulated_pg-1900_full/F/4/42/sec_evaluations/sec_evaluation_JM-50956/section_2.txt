Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sonov", assumed typo, "sanguine") might require additional interpretation.
- [SPELLING] Assumed typo ("sonov" instead of "war").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of specific historical events and figures without brief contextualization.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt transition between criticizing Ludendorff's memoirs and the chapter title "Russia's Sacrifice" slightly disrupts flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analyzing historical strategy and debunking a memoir, which, while related, could be more seamlessly integrated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
