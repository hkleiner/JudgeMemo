Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Her heart was divided between a great throb of pity and sympathy for him and an irresistible sense of gratitude for herself.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more contemporary or accessible (e.g., "mendacious", "suited the pretty action to the word")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic description to mundane task (e.g., from emotional revelation to searching for hat and butter)
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in character motivations (e.g., Lyddy's sudden decisiveness, though contextualized, feels somewhat abrupt)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
