Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I had gave her pleasure" (incorrect verb tense consistency)
- [SPELLING] "coulde" (typo, should be "could")
- [SYNTAX] "the only effect I cared about was the one it would have on Vereker up there by his bedroom fire." (slightly awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrator's emotional state towards Vereker without clear buildup (from "cruelly conceited" to affection)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt move from dinner conversation to narrator's dejection and encounter with Vereker (could benefit from smoother transition)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
