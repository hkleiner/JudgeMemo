Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mephistophelian", "literal-minded") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the Emperor's visit to the "Eleven years later" segment without a clear connecting phrase.
- [CLARITY] The text jumps between biographical narrative, artistic critique, and personal anecdotes without a strongly cohesive thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
