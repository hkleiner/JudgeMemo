Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "gulped a lungful of air" should be "gulped" is correct, but "a lungful" is informal; consider "took a deep breath" for clarity.
- [SPELLING] "t'ump" (should be "lump"), "smeller" (informal for "nose"), "extries" (should be "exteriors" or "fronts"), "g'nigh" (should be "goodnight")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial expressions ("gutted like an anaconda", "g'nigh") may reduce readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] "It was some little time the next morning before he could realize what he was doing out there under the tree." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the deer fight scene to the conversation about Ches' father without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "A good incident is an opal among gems in a lonely life." feels out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from the immediate aftermath of the deer fight to a reflective moment the next morning without a smooth transition.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
