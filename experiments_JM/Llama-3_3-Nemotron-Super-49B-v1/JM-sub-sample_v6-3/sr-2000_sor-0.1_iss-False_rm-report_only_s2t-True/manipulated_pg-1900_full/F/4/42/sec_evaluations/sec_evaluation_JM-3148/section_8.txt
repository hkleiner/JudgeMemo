Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded" (incorrect past tense of "should")
- [SPELLING] "gaze" (should be "gazed")
- [SYNTAX] "I havenâ€™t got a thing to do in my own house." (informal tone inconsistency)
- [LEXICON] "unmerciful tyrants" (somewhat archaic, may affect readability for some)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing Lyddy's actions to Anthony's introspection about his life (could be smoother)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt change from the doctor's visit to Anthony's walk and sensory descriptions (needs clearer connection)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and complex, potentially reducing clarity (e.g., the final paragraph describing Lyddy's feelings)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
