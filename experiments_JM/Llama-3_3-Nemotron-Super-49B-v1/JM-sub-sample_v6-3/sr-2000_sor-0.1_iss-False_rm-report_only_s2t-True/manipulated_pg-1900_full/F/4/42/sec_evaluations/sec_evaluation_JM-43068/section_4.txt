Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "he coulded never overlooked" (should be "could never overlook")
- [SPELLING] "allot" (should be "allotted")
- [SYNTAX] "It was this same spirit which impel" (should be "impelled")
- [LEXICON] "meagre" (non-standard spelling in American English, though correct in British English; assuming a broader audience, this might cause minor confusion)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's artistic influences to introducing the struggle against the Empire style without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph discussing Millet's preferences among artists) may hinder immediate understanding.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Millet's study period to choosing Delaroche as a master feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
