Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "There am seven or eight lamas" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "Tshulma" (likely a transcription or less common spelling, assuming "Tshalma" or similar might be intended, though not definitively incorrect without context)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary for general readability (e.g., numerous proper nouns and specialized terms without explanation)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the village to discussing the temple's decorations without a clear link
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about various ethnic groups and their languages without brief explanations for clarity

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
