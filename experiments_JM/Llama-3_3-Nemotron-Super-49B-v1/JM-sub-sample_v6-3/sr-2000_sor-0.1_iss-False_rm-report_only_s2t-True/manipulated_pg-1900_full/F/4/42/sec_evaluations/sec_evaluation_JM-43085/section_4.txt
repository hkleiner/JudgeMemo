Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic expressions (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "whilst" and "aforementioned" could be considered slightly formal) might slightly hinder readability for some modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Meissonier's response to critics and the detailed analysis of his works (e.g., from "Fortunately for him..." to the in-depth "The Game of Chess" success story).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of certain awards (e.g., third-class and second-class medals) and figures (e.g., Paul PÃ©rier) without brief contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
