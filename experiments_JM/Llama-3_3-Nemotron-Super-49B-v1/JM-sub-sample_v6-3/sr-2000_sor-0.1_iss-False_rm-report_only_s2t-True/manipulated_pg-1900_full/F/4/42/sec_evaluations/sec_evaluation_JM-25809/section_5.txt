Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "He do not want to waken" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" (contextually inappropriate, though spelled correctly; suggests a fluency issue due to jarring tone)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some parts (e.g., "the true lumina for reverie") juxtaposed with colloquialisms

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from introspection to snake encounter without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative flow (e.g., the song critique feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding and following adventure elements)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
