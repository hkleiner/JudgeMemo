Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly abrupt transition between sentences (e.g., "And the truth of it all was, both boys were right." after the debate)
- [LEXICON] Informal tone with colloquial expressions (e.g., "lots and lots of ships", "you know you would") may affect perceived formality
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense ("none of them have been lucky enough to brought back the cup" should be "brought")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing Glasgow excursions to concluding the story ("So many little cousins...") without a clear narrative bridge
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the steamer cruise and the introduction of the American cousins' visit
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., "the Highlands", "America's Cup") without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
