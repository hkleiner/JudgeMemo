Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Confederated" (should be "Confederate")
- [LEXICON] "cheerless camps" (somewhat archaic, may reduce clarity for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in paragraphs 5-7 may impede smooth reading for some

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from military strategy to soldiers' daily life (paragraphs 8-10)
- [CLARITY] Overly broad time frames (e.g., "the rest of the South") without clear connections to the main narrative
- [TRANSITION] List of dates (OCTOBER 27, 1864, to NIGHT OF APRIL 2-3, 1865) feels disconnected from the preceding text

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
