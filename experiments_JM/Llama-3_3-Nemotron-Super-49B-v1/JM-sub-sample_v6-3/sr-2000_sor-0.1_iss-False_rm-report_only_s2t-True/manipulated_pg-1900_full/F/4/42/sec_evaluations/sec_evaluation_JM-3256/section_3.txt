Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "toadied", "bashfulness") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text's thematic transitions between different book references could be more explicitly guided for the reader.
- [CLARITY] A few sentences are lengthy and packed with multiple references, potentially causing slight confusion without careful reading.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
