Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "This very short description...", "A century ago...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "desecrating", "furtive", "desultory").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Cathedral to introducing the city's walled aspect without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about specific historical figures and events without brief contextualization (e.g., Queen Bertha's significance).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
