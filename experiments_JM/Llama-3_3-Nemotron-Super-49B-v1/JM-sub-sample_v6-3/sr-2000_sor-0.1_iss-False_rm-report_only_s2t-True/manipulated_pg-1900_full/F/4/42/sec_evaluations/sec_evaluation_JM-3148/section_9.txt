Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded" (incorrect past tense, should be "could")
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (incorrect past tense, should be "would")
- [SPELLING] "quiver of the nostrils" (idiomatic expression, but might imply a slight awkwardness in phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "it’s ’most worth while being sick just to have her in the house" (informal, somewhat awkward structure)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Lyddy's prayer to the description of Davy's sickness and subsequent events (lacks a clear connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] Aunt Hitty Tarbox's dialogue feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative, lacking contextual introduction
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different timescales (e.g., "as the autumn grew into winter" without clear temporal markers)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
