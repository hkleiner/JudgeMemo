Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If any one had ever given him a task...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("guerdon", "caedn't") might require additional effort for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Minor error: "have" instead of "had" in "At fifteen he have taken...".

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Tony's natural explorations to the detailed account of instrument repairs.
- [CLARITY] The narrative's thematic focus occasionally blurs between showcasing curiosity and practical skills.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
