Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "potatow-noses" (likely "potato-noses" or more accurately "bulbous noses")
- [SPELLING] "tangutans" (likely "Tanguts")
- [SPELLING] "on the contrarys" (should be "on the contrary")
- [SPELLING] "nephew and aunt; sisters and brothers-in-law may not marry, nor stepchildren with stepfather or mother." (missing "and" for clarity, though not strictly an error)
- [SYNTAX] "A younger brother steps into his elder brother's place, in case of the death of the latter, despite the difference of age, but if the marriage has already take place" (should be "has taken")
- [SPELLING] "a month's separation the joint bed is again resumed." (missing "after" for clarity, though not strictly an error)
- [SPELLING] "village Yench'i" (inconsistency in accent mark usage, if intended)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing physical characteristics to customs without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The table's description and its implications on the tribe's population dynamics could be more clearly integrated into the narrative.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from detailed customs to the departure on the 16th feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding content.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
