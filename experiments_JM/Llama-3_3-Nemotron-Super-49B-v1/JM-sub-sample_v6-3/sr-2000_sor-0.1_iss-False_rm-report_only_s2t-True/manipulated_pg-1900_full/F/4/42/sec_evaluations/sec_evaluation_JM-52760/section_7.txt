Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Shoulded" (incorrect verb form, should be "Should")
- [GRAMMAR] "Lee agree" (subject-verb agreement, should be "Lee agreed")
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" (contextually correct but may indicate inconsistent tone/formality)
- [SYNTAX] "the line of retreat was raked by a vicious crossfire" (somewhat unclear without prior context on the layout)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the attack's plan to its execution without a clear temporal marker.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the strategic importance of Fort Stedman and its location relative to other forts.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the Battle of Fort Stedman to the introduction of the "FIVE FORKS" chapter without a concluding summary or clear connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
