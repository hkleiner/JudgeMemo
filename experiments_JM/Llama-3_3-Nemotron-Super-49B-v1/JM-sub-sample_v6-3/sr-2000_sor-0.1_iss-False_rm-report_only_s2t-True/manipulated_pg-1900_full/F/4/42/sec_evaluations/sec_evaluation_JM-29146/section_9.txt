Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in several places (e.g., "You didn't breathe on a timeless world. You merely--somehow--existed.")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similar adjectives for emotional descriptions (e.g., "loveliest", "sad", "lovely", "awed")
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency in a few instances (e.g., "Ramsey have ever been vouchsafed" should be "had ever been vouchsafed")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or excessive commas in dialogue tags for clarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Contradiction regarding the possibility of death on a timeless world (character dies from lack of air despite previous establishment that this isn't possible)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the description of the music to the revelation of the teleporter without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear resolution or explanation of the vision Ramsey experiences and its immediate relevance
- [TRANSITION] Sudden appearance of new characters without prior hint or smooth introduction
