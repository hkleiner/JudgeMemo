Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "The greatness of the age, as I have said, depended on a combination of circumstances in their nature transient.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "pernicious habit", "sentimental brutalism")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor error: "The signs was" should be "The signs were"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing literature to social class fusion and industrial impacts
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear, singular focus (e.g., the final paragraph jumps between future prospects, the role of the younger generation, and the speakers' generational transition)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between distinct topics (e.g., from Victorian literature to the Industrial Revolution's impact)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
