Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "And so the disturbances of 1848, once more kindled by Paris, just failed;" 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "enrag√©s", "sentimental antiquarianism")
- [SPELLING] "was" instead of "were" in "Russia, Prussia, and Austria, acting together, were not to was resisted."
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement issue in "nearly all the despotic governments of Europe were overthrown in 1848, and nearly all were restored a year later." (implied subject shift)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing European politics to the Victorian Age's prosperity without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and somewhat disjointed discussion of literary movements (e.g., sudden digression on Tennyson's portrait)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous statement: "We have to remember that the prosperity and security of the happy time which we are now considering were due to temporary causes, which can never recur." (Lacks clear explanation of "temporary causes")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
