2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from dialogue to detailed description of Margot's appearance without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene change (e.g., from the apartment to the street and back) without clear temporal markers
- [CLARITY] The letter's content and its immediate relevance to the plot are not clearly explained within the segment
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Ramsey's decision to take Margot to Centauri to the scene in her apartment feels rushed
