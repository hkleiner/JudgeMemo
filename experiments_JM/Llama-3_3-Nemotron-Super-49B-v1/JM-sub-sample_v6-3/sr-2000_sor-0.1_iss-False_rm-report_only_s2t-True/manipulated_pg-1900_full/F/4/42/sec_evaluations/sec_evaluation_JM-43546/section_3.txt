Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The schools and colleges in Scotland was" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] "you am very 'chief'" (incorrect use of "am" instead of "are")
- [SPELLING] "lived" (incorrect past tense, should be "lived" is correct, but context suggests "returned" or similar might be more appropriate, however, this is not a spelling error, removing)
- [SYNTAX] "which could be easily reached from Kelvin House" (slightly awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from educational topics to game description ("Let's play 'beezee'...")
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "Tales of a Grandfather" without introduction
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from daily activities to the "CHAPTER: A WALK IN EDINBURGH" without clear connection
