Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "avidity", "trevaille", "connoisseur") might require additional mental processing.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing the protagonist's brother to George Corvick's activities without a clear transitional link within the evaluated segment.
- [STRUCTURE] The section's connection to the broader narrative arc (especially regarding Vereker and the "figure in the carpet") is assumed rather than clearly contextualized within this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
