Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "perplexed", "apologist", "Pilpul") might slow comprehension for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between historical examples and modern comparisons feel abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between critique, historical context, and philosophical interpretation without clear sectioning or transitional phrases.
