Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "fenced in" should likely be "fenced" (context suggests enclosing land, not an action on the prairies themselves)
- [SYNTAX] "gradually settle down" should be "gradually settled down" (verb tense consistency)
- [LEXICON] "flourished" should be "flourishing" (adjective form inconsistency in the context)
- [GRAMMAR] "am" should be "were" (subject-verb agreement with "Mexican officers")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the town's decline to its revival with the railroad (lacks a connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] The sentence "The promise of cultured prosperity... was at length realized." is somewhat vague without specifying what "promise" refers to
- [TRANSITION] The shift from historical events to the list of flags at the end feels disconnected from the preceding narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
