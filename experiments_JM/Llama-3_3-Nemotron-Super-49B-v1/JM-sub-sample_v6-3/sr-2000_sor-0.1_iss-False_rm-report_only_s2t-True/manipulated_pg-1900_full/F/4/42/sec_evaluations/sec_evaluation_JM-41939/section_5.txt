Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "She woulded not excuse laziness" (incorrect verb form, should be "would not")
- [LEXICON] "purplish and cottony" (uncommon descriptors, may cause slight confusion)
- [GRAMMAR] "Rosa Bonheur have no sooner withdrawn" (subject-verb agreement error, should be "had")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Imperial Court visit to Universal Exposition of 1867 (lacks connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the "parenthesis" about the art school isn't fully clear in relation to the surrounding context
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing the artist's work to the war of 1870 (could benefit from a transitional sentence)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
