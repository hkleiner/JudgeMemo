Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward sentence structure in "We will went to this new land together" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] Overly sentimental language in some passages (e.g., "blessed chance", "loving and true welcome") may feel less nuanced

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the emotional reunion to the introduction of Jack Martin without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment (jumps between different times/events without clear transitions)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
