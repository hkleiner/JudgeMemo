Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "he have come" (should be "had come")
- [SPELLING] "renannouncement" (likely "renouncement")
- [SYNTAX] "it strike people" (should be "it strikes people")
- [LEXICON] "am" used instead of "are" in "They am both"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Vereker's death to analyzing the marriage's intellectual compatibility
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from the death of Vereker's wife to the narrator's expectations from Deane) without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures obscuring direct understanding (e.g., the paragraph beginning "I began with due promptness")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
