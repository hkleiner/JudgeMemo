Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "shoulded" (likely a typo for "should")
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "If wisdom at one entrance was nearly shut out, there was plenty left...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Reynolds' social life to the Academy Exhibition's location change without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain historical figures/artistic terms without brief explanation (e.g., "the Low Countries" visit's significance).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
