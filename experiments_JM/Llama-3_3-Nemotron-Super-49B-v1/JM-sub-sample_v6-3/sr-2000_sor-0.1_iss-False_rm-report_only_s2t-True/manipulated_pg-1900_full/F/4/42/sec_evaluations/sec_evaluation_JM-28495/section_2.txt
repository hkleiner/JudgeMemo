Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "We had overrun our quarry. He had just emerged from some hiding place...")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading (e.g., "quarry", "thou", "vernal")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and context between chapters without clear transition (e.g., from chase to naming the puppy)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt ending to the chase scene without resolution before moving to a new setting

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
