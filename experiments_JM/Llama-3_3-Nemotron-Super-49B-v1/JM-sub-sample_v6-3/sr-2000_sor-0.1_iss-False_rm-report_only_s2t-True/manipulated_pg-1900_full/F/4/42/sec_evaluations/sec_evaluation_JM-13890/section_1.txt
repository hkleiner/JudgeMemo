Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "whilst" implied in context) might require additional interpretation time.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from historical narrative to modern pilgrim commentary (between chapters).
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Thomas Becket's significance) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
