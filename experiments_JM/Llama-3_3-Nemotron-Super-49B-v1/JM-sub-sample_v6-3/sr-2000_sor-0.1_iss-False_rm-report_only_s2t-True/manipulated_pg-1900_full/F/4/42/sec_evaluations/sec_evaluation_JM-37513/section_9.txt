Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It may be said that Spencer accepted the so-called identity hypothesis...") 
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "antithesis", "reciprocal" in this context) 
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "we may call... we may speak... we may try")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with Spencer's works without clear context 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's theory to the concept of "cognitive relatedness" 
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient elaboration for clarity (e.g., "the relational meshwork of bewildering complexity")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
