Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "ausgechlossen", "apocalyptic visions") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between historical/cultural references and modern implications feel abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between various themes (critique of national legends, Jewish literature, future of religions) without clear sectioning or transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
