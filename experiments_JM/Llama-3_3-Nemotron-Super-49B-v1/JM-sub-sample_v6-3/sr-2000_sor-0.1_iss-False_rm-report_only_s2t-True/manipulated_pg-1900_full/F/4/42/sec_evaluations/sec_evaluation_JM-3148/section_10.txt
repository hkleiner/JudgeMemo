Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "he coulded write" (incorrect verb conjugation)
- [LEXICON] "the seeds am springing" (incorrect verb form, should be "are")
- [SPELLING] "was his wife if you could see my face; you could not love me an instant if you were not blind." (missing quotation mark at the beginning of the sentence, though this could be a formatting error in the provided text)
- [SYNTAX] "Davy did not quite understand this, though he thought it pretty; but Lyddyâ€™s husband do" (incorrect verb form, should be "did")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Anthony's work to the scene with Davy reading (could benefit from a smoother transition)
- [CLARITY] Some poetic descriptions, while beautiful, may slightly obscure the immediate understanding of the scene for some readers (e.g., the detailed description of the basket and its contents)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
