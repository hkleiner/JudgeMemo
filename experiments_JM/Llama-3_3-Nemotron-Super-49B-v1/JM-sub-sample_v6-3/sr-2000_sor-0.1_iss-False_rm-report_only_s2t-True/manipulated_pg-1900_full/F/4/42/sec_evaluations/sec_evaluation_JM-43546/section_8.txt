Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "What was it all about? Well, it was St. Patrick's Day..." (abrupt transition)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some descriptions (e.g., "with great ceremony", "greatest poet") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "I knew he'd came" should be "I knew he'd come"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from New Year's Eve to St. Patrick's Day without clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt change in scene from Kelvin House to the garden wall without preparatory context
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of St. Patrick's Day clashes between Scotch and Irish lads

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
