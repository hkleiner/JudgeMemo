Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "scabrous", "muck-rake", "Pantisocracy") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's familiarity with referenced literary works and historical events (e.g., Malory, Spenser, Milton, Victorian social context) without brief contextualization.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing Tennyson's work, Victorian era characteristics, and broader philosophical/religious trends, lacking smooth connectors.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
