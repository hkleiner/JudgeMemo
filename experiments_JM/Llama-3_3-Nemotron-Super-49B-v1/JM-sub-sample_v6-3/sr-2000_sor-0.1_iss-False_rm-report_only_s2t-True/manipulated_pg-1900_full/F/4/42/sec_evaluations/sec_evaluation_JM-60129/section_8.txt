Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some domain-specific or less common terms (e.g., "kutas", "ta jen") might require additional context for full understanding.
- [SPELLING] "one woulded" (should be "would have") in the sentence about cleanliness.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between various aspects of YÃ¶gur life (marriage, childbirth, physical appearance, intelligence, costume, hygiene) without clear transitional links.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of comparative groups (e.g., Kalmucks, Mongolians) might confuse readers unfamiliar with these references.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
