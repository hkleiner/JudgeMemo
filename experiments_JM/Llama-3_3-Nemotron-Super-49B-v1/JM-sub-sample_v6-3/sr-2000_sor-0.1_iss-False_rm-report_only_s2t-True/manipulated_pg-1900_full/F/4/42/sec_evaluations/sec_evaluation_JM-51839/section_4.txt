- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The news of victory soon restored the minds of the people to sanity, and they entered with alacrity into the work of establishing the new government of the Republic."

- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error: "he have other designs"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the "Run-Away Scrape" to introducing "The Republic" chapter without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological event presentation within the "Commercial Expansion" chapter
- [CLARITY] Unclear implication of "the war was not over yet" without specifying which war aspect remained unresolved
