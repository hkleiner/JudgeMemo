Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several passages (e.g., the lengthy, unpunctuated stream of thought in the bookman's reverie)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "lang and late", "ithers", "ae tow")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (not explicitly found but potential given the text's nature and length)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from literary analysis to the bookman's personal habits and fantasies
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear, connecting theme to the overall discussion (e.g., the detailed rearrangement of books)
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Jeanie Deans and Lady Castlewood feels somewhat disconnected from the subsequent narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
