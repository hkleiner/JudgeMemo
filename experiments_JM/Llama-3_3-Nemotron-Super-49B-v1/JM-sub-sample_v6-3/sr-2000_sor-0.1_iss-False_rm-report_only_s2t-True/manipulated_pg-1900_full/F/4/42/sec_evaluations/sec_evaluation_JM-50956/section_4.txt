Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "inopportune", "stupdendous") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes reader's prior knowledge of specific historical events (e.g., Verdun offensive context) without brief clarification.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing 1915's challenges to introducing 1916's Brusilov offensive without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
