Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "And it is because they are the surest way to happiness, that the most enlightened go after them.")
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "effervescent", "inmost", "futile") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing personal happiness and the inevitability of striving despite futility feels somewhat abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter jumps between philosophical reflection, hypothetical scenarios, and broader societal commentary without clear transitional markers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
