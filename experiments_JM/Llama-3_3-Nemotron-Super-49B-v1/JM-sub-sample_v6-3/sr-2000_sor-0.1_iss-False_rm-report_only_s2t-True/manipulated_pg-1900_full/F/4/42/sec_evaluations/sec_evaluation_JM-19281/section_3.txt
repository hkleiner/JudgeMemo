Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "What has not changed is the inescapable requirement of making such choices, whether for better or worse.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "inescapable", "reemergence", "simmering")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in one instance ("was made" instead of "were made" in "earnest attempts are was made")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with Bahá'í teachings and context without sufficient introduction
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the role of religions and introducing the dilemma faced by Bahá'ís
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, making the flow of thought somewhat hard to follow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
