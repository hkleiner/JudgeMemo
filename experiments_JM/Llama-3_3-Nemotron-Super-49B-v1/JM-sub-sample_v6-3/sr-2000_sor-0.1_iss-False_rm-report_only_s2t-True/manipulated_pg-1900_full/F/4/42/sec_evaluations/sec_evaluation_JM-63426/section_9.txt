Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "was to be have" (incorrect verb form, should be "to have")
- [SPELLING] "enjoy back" (should be "enjoyed back" for consistency, though "enjoy" might be intentionally colloquial)
- [SYNTAX] "the training to be have by" (awkward phrasing, should be "the training available to")
- [LEXICON] "am literally made to order" (could imply "was literally made to order" for clarity, though the original might be colloquial)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that modern opportunities are universally better without direct comparison evidence.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing personal history to modern design opportunities without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "so many opportunities yet to be grasped by the designer" is somewhat vague.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
