Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple paragraphs (e.g., "But one of the spiritual advantages of feasting is that it expands you beyond your common sense. One excess induced another, and a finer one.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "sirocco", "rejuvenators")
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs without clear subsections

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that critics would suggest replacing Christmas with a "shop-counter" and "shelves" without clear basis
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing feast excess to the Christmas Tree without a smooth connection
- [REPETITIVENESS] Repeated defense against unspecified sceptical views without adding new insights

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
