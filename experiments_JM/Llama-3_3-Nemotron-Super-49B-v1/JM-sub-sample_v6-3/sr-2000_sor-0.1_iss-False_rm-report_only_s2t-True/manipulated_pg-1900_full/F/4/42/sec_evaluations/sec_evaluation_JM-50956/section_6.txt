Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Russia, although sapped by the Germano-Bolshevist conspiracy, was still formidable...") 
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "the enemy" without variation 
- [PUNCTUATION] Lack of commas for clarity in long lists (e.g., "in East Prussia, Galicia, on the fields of Poland, Lithuania, Roumania, in the Caucasus and Armenia")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers understand strategic implications without explanation (e.g., "strategy says plainly: 'Errors in the strategic deploying of forces...'") 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing losses to concluding Russia's role (between "12,000,000" section and "CHAPTER: Conclusion") 
- [CLARITY] Overly technical language without explanation (e.g., "the fundamental idea of Moltke's plan")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
