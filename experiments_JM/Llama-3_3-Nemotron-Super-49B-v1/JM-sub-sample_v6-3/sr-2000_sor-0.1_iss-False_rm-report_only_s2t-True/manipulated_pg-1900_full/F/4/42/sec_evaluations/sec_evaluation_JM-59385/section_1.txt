Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the shadows was long" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "moustaches" (commonly spelled as "mustaches" in American English, though "moustaches" is acceptable in British English)
- [SYNTAX] "as she could went no farther" (incorrect verb sequence, should be "as she could go no farther")
- [LEXICON] "ventured up through the paved stones were worn away" (slightly awkward phrasing for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewel selection scene to the memory of the mission school (lacks a smoother connection)
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the memory flashback isn't immediately clear in relation to the current scene (could benefit from a clearer link)
- [TRANSITION] The ending of the current segment feels somewhat incomplete regarding the jewel selection's conclusion (though this might be due to it being a segment of a longer text)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
