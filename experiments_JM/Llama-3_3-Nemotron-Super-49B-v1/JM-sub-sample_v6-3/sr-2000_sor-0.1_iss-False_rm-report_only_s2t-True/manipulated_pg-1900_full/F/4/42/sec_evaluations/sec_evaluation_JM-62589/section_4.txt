Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "You were long enough in coming, lad," he said, "I’m nearly frozen. What you doing in those togs?" (missing "are")
- [SPELLING] "tear" should be "tears" in "There am tears in the boy’s eyes." (subject-verb agreement)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some dialogue may feel less natural (e.g., "God help me!" while effective, contrasts with more modern expectations in some other phrasings)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of the second character extremely similar to Robert feels unprepared (lack of foreshadowing)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from the camp's situation to Robert's solo quest without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Mason's condition and actions could be more clearly explained for immediate understanding (e.g., how he ended up with the British)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
