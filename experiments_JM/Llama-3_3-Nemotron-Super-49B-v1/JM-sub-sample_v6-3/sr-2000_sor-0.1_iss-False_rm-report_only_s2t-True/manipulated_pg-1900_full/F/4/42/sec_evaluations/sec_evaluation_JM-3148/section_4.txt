Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "She had assisted in a secondary capacity at funerals in the families of other people, but she would have revelled in personally conducted ones.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "cabined, cribbed, confined", "revelled")
- [LENGTH] Extremely long paragraphs without clear section breaks

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical musings about Anthony Croft to the narrative about Aunt Hitty and Mrs. Butterfield's death
- [FOCUS] Tangents (e.g., detailed planning of the funeral, backstory on Aunt Hitty's funeral interests) slightly detract from the main narrative flow
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of the philosophical section and the start of the new chapter (CHAPTER III) within the evaluated segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
