Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "He could never study when a fly buzzed on the window-pane; he was always standing on the toes of his bare feet, trying to locate and understand the buzz that puzzled him.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "degraded", "palpitating mysteries", "jewâ€™s-harp")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the descriptive scene with Davy to the backstory of Anthony Croft without a clear connecting device.
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in quickly understanding the shift from dialogue-driven narrative to reflective, biographical narrative about Anthony Croft.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
