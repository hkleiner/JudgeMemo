Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fourpence-halfpenny", "MÃ¦cenas") might require additional cognitive effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between defining a "bookman", a personal anecdote, and a separate illustrative story, which might slightly disrupt the flow for some readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of specific literary works and authors (e.g., Elia, Spenser, Chaucer, Mark Rutherford) could alienate less literarily versed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
