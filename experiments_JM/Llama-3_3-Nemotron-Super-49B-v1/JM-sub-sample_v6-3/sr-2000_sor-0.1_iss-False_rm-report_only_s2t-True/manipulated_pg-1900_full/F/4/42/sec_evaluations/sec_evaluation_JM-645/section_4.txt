Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The failure of _my_ fun was at the moment of our meeting not complete, but I saw it ahead, and Corvick saw that I see it.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "maddening month", "vulgar", "supersubtlety") might require additional processing for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor assumption of prior knowledge about characters' relationships and context (e.g., George Corvick's situation with Mrs. Erme and his nuptial plans)
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting between narrative reflections and direct conversations (e.g., transitioning from the narrator's thoughts to Vereker's letter)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
