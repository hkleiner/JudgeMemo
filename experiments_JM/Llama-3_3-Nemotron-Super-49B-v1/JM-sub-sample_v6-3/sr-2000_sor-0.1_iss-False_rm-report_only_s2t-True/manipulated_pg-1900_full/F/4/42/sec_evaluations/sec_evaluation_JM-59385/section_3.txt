Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Noiselessly she slid the bar and stood without the compound." could benefit from clearer progression).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pilgrimages", "honorable") might reduce readability for all but the most literate readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past simple and past perfect without clear narrative justification).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The abrupt transition from the wedding festivities to Kuei Ping's nighttime escape feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding detailed descriptions.
- [CLARITY] The motivations behind Kuei Ping's decision to leave the compound could be more explicitly stated for clearer understanding.
- [TRANSITION] The shift in focus from collective wedding celebrations to Kuei Ping's solitary, nocturnal adventure lacks a smooth narrative bridge.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
