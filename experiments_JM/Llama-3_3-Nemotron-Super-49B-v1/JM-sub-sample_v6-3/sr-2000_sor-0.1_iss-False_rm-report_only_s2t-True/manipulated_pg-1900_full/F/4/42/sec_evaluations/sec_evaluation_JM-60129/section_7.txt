Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The bodies of richer people was burnt" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "am" (should be "are" in "who am in bad repute")
- [SYNTAX] "Marriages are not entered into among the members of the same 'bone', as said above" (slightly awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "a kind ol Governor General" (likely typo for "a kind of Governor General")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and detailed customs description
- [CLARITY] Overly complex and dense listing of "bones" without clear explanation of their significance initially
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the description of the tribe's demographics and the administrative division

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
