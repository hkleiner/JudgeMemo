Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "What were his hopes and sorrows now?" (feels out of place)
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language in "an awful agony took possession of his last conscious thought" (distracts from fluency)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "He gave countersign and dragged on" (should be "the countersign")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's exhaustion to detailed conversation without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene change from the group's apprehension to Shirtliffe's solo ride (could benefit from a clearer bridge)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
