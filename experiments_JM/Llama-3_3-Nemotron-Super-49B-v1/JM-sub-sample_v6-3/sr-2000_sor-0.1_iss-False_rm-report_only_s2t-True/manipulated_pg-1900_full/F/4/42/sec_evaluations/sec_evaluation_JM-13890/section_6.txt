Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or highly specialized vocabulary (e.g., "lierne vaulting", "campanilis Angeli") might challenge less knowledgeable readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive, historical, and somewhat philosophical reflections without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge (e.g., of Becket's murder, specific historical figures) could confuse readers without the context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
