Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (incorrect past tense of "would")
- [GRAMMAR] "he have not laid down" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [GRAMMAR] "I would not allow myself to enter the street" (incorrect use of "would" in this context)
- [GRAMMAR] "the pledge must be made of a solemn character with witnesses" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "I would never bought" (incorrect verb tense)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the anecdote about Quaritch and the subsequent discussion on family men and bibliomania
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph describing the bookman's struggles)
- [LOGIC] The analogy between dipsomania and bibliomania, while creative, slightly disrupts the flow due to its depth and length
