Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "drouth" (should be "drought") in the "EYES OF FATHER MARGIL" section

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic or chronological organization across sections
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences between distinct historical topics
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or packed with multiple pieces of unrelated information (e.g., the GRAVE OF WILLIAM GOYENS section)
