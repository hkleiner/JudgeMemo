Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Even in the country Rosa Bonheur have no chance to rested." (Subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "mighted" (should be "might")
- [SYNTAX] "And all this was only one part of her menagerie; the rest was domiciled at her country place at Chevilly, where she also had another studio." (Slightly awkward transition)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from describing the menagerie to discussing Rosa Bonheur's fame and orders without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different time periods and topics (menagerie, fame, travels, awards) without a smooth chronological or thematic flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
