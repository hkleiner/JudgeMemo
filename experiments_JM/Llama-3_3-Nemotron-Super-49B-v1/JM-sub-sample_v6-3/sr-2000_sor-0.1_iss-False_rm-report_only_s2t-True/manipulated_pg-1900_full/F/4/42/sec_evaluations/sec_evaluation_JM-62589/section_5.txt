Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The cutting winds of the March evening swept o’er him. Morley returned, and not seeing his prisoner gave a sneering smile and hurried away." (Lack of clear connection between clauses)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language ("'sed", "thou", "by Gad") may hinder modern readability
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "a last look to the face" (should be "a last look at the face")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Unexplained shift in Robert's actions from tending to Mason to waiting beside the road without clear motivation
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the emotional scene with Mason's death to the practical conversation between the Britishers
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "something I wanted to tell her, but I can’t remember all" without further context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
