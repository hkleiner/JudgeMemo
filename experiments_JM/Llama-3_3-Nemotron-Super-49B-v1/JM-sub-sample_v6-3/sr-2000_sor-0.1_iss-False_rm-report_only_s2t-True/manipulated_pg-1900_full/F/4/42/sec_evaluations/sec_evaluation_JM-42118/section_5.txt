Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is part of the irony of life that Fragonard...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "light-o'-love", "make-believe", "clogging its grace") might require additional context for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Du Barry and Fragonard's art to introducing the "MARRIAGE" chapter without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about Fragonard's inspiration from Dutch landscapists and his unique adaptation could benefit from clearer linking to the preceding and following text.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
