Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I spend a number of Saturdays" (should be "spent")
- [SPELLING] "we woulded attend" (should be "would attend")
- [LEXICON] "heartily welcomed the suggestion" (somewhat formal, but not an error, thus minor)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing board interactions and introducing "CHAPTER: SCHOOL ACTIVITIES" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The quote from the Seattle high school principal feels tacked on without thorough integration or explanation of its relevance.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
