Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey pick up his credit note but stand there." (Subject-verb agreement error: should be "stood")
- [SPELLING] None detected in the current segment.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, slightly hindering flow (e.g., the paragraph starting with "It was abruptly silent...").
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("thertainly", "thtink", etc.) for the Irwadian's speech may slightly affect readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency: The narrative implies Ramsey is used to insults but is notably affected by Garr Symm, without clear justification for the difference in reaction.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between the gambling hall scene and Ramsey's reflections without a clear transitional phrase or sentence in one instance.
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Garr Symm's actions) could be more clearly explained or set up within the provided context.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the personal interaction with Englander to the gambling hall could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
