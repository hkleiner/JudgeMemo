Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I is prepared" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "déjeûner" (possible misspelling, though contextually understandable as French, yet inconsistent with expected English spelling in the text)
- [SYNTAX] "I woulded go" (incorrect verb conjugation)
- [LEXICON] "viscous flies" (inaccurate adjective usage; "viscous" refers to fluid thickness, not a characteristic of flies)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing the hotel's conditions and the vision of flies from Verdun
- [CLARITY] Overly abrupt ending without fully resolving the narrative's tension at the station
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from hospital descriptions to the drive within the city limits without clear connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
