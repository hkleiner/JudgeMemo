- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance clarity (e.g., "distant soldier suffering in grateful silence")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing the woman in the hospital and shifting to the HÃ´pital Central description
- [CLARITY] The example of the Frenchman's financial situation, while illustrative, slightly disrupts the flow from hospital description to appeal for aid
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the hospital tour and the discussion on French wealth and the appeal for American support

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
