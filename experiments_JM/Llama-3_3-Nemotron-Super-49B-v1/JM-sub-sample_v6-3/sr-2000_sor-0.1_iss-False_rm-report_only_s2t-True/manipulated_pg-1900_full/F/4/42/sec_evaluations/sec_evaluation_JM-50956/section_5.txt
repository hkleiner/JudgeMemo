Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "inconsiderable", "interfered with a broad development") might slightly hinder readability for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different time periods (1915, 1916, 1917) and events without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing readers.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense with information, reducing immediate clarity (e.g., the paragraph describing the aftermath of Brusilov's offensive).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
