        • Overly complex vocabulary in certain descriptions (e.g., "vacuous benevolence", "radiant, fragrant vision") may hinder readability for some readers - [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "It was his daily walk with Eileen, however, which introduced Excalibur to life--life in its broadest and most romantic sense. As I was not privileged to **was** present..." (redundant "was") - [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "The parcel in question **contain**..."

    - [CLARITY]:
        • The curate's statement about the hardships of living on a hundred pounds a year, while clear in intent, assumes a level of familiarity with the economic challenges of the clergy that some readers might not share.
