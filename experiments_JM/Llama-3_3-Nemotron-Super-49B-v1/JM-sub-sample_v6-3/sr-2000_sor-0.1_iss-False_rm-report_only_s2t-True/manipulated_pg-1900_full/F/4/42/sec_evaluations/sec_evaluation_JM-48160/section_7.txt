Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Naturally their homes were spared by their loyal countrymen. Germany not only knew who owned every square inch of ground in France, but where every work of art great and small is installed." (Lack of transitional phrase)
- [LEXICON] Word choice "moist trip" (could be more descriptive or clear)
- [GRAMMAR] "it woulded not be allowed" (typo/error in verb form)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from describing Gerbéviller to discussing German knowledge of French assets without clear connection
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the story of Gerbéviller and the anecdote about the hotel in Remiramont
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different locations and ideas (Gerbéviller, Remiramont, Thann, Dugny/Verdun) without a clear thematic or chronological link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
