Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "latten", "lowness of its vaulted roof") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between describing architectural features, historical events, and personal reflections without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of referenced works (e.g., Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales") and historical figures might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
