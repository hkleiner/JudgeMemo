Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "In his hand he held a tablet on which was fastened a sheet of white paper, and he was carefully sketching himself, studying his reflection in a mirror.")
- [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "cumbered", "redingote", "breeches of white cashmere") might require additional effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Meissonier's sketching scene to discussing his collection and "working library" without a clear connecting phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between specific anecdotes and broader descriptions of Meissonier's habits and collection, which, while mostly coherent, could benefit from smoother transitions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
