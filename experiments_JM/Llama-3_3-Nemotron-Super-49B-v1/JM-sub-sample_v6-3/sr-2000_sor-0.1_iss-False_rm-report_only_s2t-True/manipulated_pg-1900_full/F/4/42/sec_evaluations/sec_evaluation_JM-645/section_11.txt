Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "have thought him worth marrying" (should be "had thought")
- [GRAMMAR] "She had married him for something else." (sudden shift in tense consistency)
- [LEXICON] "unmentioned, and still less any unmentionable" (somewhat archaic phrasing may affect readability for some readers)
- [SPELLING] "I have no sooner speak" (should be "I had no sooner spoken")
- [SYNTAX] "What I see, though I couldn’t say it, was that his wife hadn’t think him worth enlightening." (should be "hadn't thought")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about Mrs. Deane's reasons for marriage feels somewhat forced without explicit setup.
- [TRANSITION] Shift from conversation to narrator's introspection about Drayton's worthiness to be trusted feels slightly abrupt.
- [CLARITY] The narrator's immediate shift from accusing tone to empathy ("My compunction was real") could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
