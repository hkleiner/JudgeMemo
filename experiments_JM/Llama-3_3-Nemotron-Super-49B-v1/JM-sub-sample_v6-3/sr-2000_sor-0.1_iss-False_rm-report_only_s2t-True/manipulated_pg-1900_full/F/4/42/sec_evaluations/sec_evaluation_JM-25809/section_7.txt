Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (archaic/non-standard verb form, e.g., "would" instead of "would have")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquialisms ("Bime-by", "yer", "neider") may hinder readability for some readers
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of the hunting trip) may slow reading flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the intense tunnel work description to the leisurely hunting trip scene
- [CLARITY] The shift in Jim's character from relentless worker to compassionate hunter could be more smoothly integrated
- [LOGIC] The hunting trip's purpose (as a holiday from overwork) feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding intense labor descriptions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
