Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the war do not interrupt" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] "did during the war" (awkward phrasing, more natural: "what they did during the war")
- [SYNTAX] "We must remembered" (tense inconsistency, should be "We must remember")
- [SPELLING] "saviour woulded" (incorrect past tense, should be "would have been needed" or simply "was needed")
- [SYNTAX] "carlyle have also learned" (subject-verb agreement error, should be "Carlyle had also learned")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from discussing the war's impact to literary figures without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and somewhat disjointed discussion of economic, social, and literary themes
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder understanding for non-expert readers (e.g., the paragraph on Ruskin's views)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the critique of industrialization and the introduction of Carlyle and Ruskin's philosophies

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
