Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "The exercise may put a strain upon you; but its effect is a scientific certainty.")
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "exacerbation", "scotches", "effervescent") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that practicing goodwill inevitably leads to increased happiness without direct evidence in the provided segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the exercise's benefits to introducing "The Feast of St. Friend" without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
