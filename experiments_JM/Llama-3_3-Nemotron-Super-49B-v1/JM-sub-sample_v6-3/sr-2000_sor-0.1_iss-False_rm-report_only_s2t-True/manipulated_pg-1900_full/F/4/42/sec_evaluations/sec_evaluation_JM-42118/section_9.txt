Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "frizzed out", "gaiety of heart") might slow some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Fragonard's life to discussing the broader artistic and historical context (e.g., the paragraph starting "To understand the atmosphere...").
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumping between biography and art historical commentary) could confuse some readers.
