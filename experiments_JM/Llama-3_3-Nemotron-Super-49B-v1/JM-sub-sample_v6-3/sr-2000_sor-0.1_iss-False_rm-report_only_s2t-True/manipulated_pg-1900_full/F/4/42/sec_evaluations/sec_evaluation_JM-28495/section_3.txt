Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was quite impossible, too, short of locking him up, to prevent him from accompanying us when we took our walks abroad, if he had made up his mind to do so.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "perambulators", "d√©tour", "patrician calm") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different anecdotes about Excalibur without a clear transitional link, potentially disrupting the flow.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from Excalibur's antics to the dinner party and its aftermath might slightly confuse readers without contextual preparation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
