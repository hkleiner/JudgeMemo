Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "But, expensive though it was, it was very pleasant to live there...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "quaff the cup of its delights", "coup de main").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing life in Manila and a hamlet to describing a Filipino sitting-room without a clear connecting thought.
- [CLARITY] The shift in focus (e.g., from lifestyle contrasts to specific home furnishings) could be smoother for better flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
