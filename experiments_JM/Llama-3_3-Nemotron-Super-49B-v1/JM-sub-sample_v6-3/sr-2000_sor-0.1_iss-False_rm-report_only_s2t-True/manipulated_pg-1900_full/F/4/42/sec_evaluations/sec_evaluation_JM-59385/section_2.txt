Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "had been selected and to paid homage" (missing "to" after "paid" in context, but not in current segment; however, "she could went" in context and "she have been dressed" in current segment show tense inconsistencies)
- [GRAMMAR] "she have been dressed" (incorrect verb tense)
- [LEXICON] "sickened sweet perfume" (potentially confusing adjective combination)
- [SYNTAX] "the culmination of the alliance had waited but the year" (slightly awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption of prior knowledge about Chinese customs and calendar without explanation
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from introspective memory to detailed description of wedding preparations without clear transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences may hinder immediate understanding for some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
