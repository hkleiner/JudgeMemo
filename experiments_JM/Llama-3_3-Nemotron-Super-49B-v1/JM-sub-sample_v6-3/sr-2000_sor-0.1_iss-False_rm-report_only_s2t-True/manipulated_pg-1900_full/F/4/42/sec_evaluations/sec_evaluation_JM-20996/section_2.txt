- [SYNTAX] "Long waving bamboos...penetrated it only at intervals" (slightly unclear, consider rephrasing for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Manila's life to the notice about supplies without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the mass meeting and the cablegram could be more clearly explained.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the emotional farewell to the new chapter ("A DRAMA IN ACTUAL LIFE") feels somewhat disconnected.
