Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "invidiously", "centripetal", "dynast") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing biblical examples to quoting modern Jewish movements without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge of various religious texts and historical figures (e.g., Maimonides, Spinoza, Ibn Gabirol) could confuse less informed readers.
