Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "it have always been" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [GRAMMAR] "the time thus spend" (typo: "spent")
- [GRAMMAR] "which would had sufficed" (incorrect verb form: "would have sufficed")
- [GRAMMAR] "she woulded add" (incorrect verb form: "would add")
- [SPELLING] "Rue de la Bienfaisance" (assumed correct, but if not, it would be an issue; no clear errors in provided text)
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially affecting flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between artistic development and domestic life details (e.g., introduction of Germain Bonheur).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of certain art movements or figures (e.g., Ingres' principle) without brief explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Salon successes to personal life events without clear connecting phrase.
