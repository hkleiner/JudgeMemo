Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "What she had left of material things woulded last until the news of her departure reached the Chia compound.")
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error ("woulded" instead of "would last")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance vividness (e.g., "colorless dreams" is effective, but a few descriptions rely on familiar tropes)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Kuei Ping's departure decision to her morning prayer without a clear temporal marker
- [CLARITY] The shift in Kuei Ping's emotional state from seeking freedom to finding joy could be more subtly developed
- [TRANSITION] The poem excerpts ("Wherein...") feel somewhat disconnected from the narrative flow without clearer integration

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
