Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "as he go about his duties" (should be "as he went")
- [SPELLING] "coulded" (should be "could")
- [SYNTAX] "Washington has sent for you to thank you for what you did at Trenton, He would probably promote you for bravery;" (missing comma or period after "Trenton" for clearer sentence separation)
- [LEXICON] "tore my punishment likeâ€”a man!" (idiomatic expression could be more naturally phrased as "face my punishment like a man")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from military to personal backstory without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene changes (e.g., from Doctor Bell's tent to Washington's presence) without bridging narrative
- [CLARITY] Debby's emotional state and thoughts could be more explicitly connected to actions for deeper understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
