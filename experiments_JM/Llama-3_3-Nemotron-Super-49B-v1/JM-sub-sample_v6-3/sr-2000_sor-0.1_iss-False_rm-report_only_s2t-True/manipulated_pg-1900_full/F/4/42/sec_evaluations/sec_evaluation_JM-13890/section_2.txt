Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "began to brought in many converts" (incorrect verb tense consistency)
- [LEXICON] "the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church" (somewhat archaic or less common phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "it would not be an easy matter to say whether the building were older" (subjunctive mood could be more clearly indicated for modern readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing St. Martin's historical significance to the broader impact of the Reformation on Canterbury (lacks a smoother connection)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in paragraphs discussing the multiple churches and their timelines (may confuse without close attention)
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Augustine's time to the Dane's attack in 1011 feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding detailed architectural and religious history

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
