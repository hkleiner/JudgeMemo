Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., the transition between discussing Cromwell and Marvell)
- [LEXICON] Occasional archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "naïveté", "exalt", "smote") may hinder smooth reading for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few places (e.g., "becomesed" should be "became")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing England's empire to comparing with Israel's evolution without clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression of ideas, jumping between historical figures and poetic analyses without clear sectioning
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs require re-reading due to dense, abstract concepts (e.g., the explanation of national missions and their evolution)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
