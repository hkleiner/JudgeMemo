Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If the military machine was forced to appear callous, individually it recognized the necessity...").
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "Réformé Numero II", "taube") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, with some topics feeling somewhat abruptly introduced (e.g., the shift to bathtubs for the wounded).
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge (e.g., specifics of French military structure, the significance of the Battle of the Marne) might slightly obscure understanding for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
