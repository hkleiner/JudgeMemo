Evaluation Form:

- [GRAMMAR] "am begun" (should be "had begun"), "am lost" (should be "was lost"), "succeed in returned" (should be "succeeded in returning")

- [LEXICON] None detected

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between discussing the loss of the Weldon Railroad and the raid by Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological insertion of the "JULY 30, 1864..." timeline section disrupts narrative flow
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences, making the direction unclear at times
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs (e.g., from Hampton's raid to the resumption of the westerly advance)
