Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Shirtliffe have not seen" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "frosted feet" (contextually unclear if intentional or error, assuming typo for "frostbitten")
- [SYNTAX] "What they suffered, he shared" (simple, yet somewhat awkward structure for emphasis)
- [LEXICON] "stinging tears of agony" (somewhat clich√©d, but not fluency issue per se; removed as per instruction clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Robert's personal struggle to the encounter with Washington (lacks a smoother connective phrase)
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter title "CHAPTER VII. - A STRANGE CHRISTMAS." feels abruptly introduced without contextual lead-in within the provided segment
- [CLARITY] Washington's prayer and its context could be more seamlessly integrated into the narrative flow for new readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
