Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "They spend the next three days sleeping and slowly going stir-crazy." (could be rephrased for better flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of passive voice in some sections (e.g., "were being watch", though corrected in context to "being watched" would improve)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor error: "We'lled work" should be "We'll work"
- [PUNCTUATION] Lack of Oxford comma in some lists for clarity (personal preference, not a hard rule)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from technical spaceship repairs to romantic tension without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment (jumps between action, dialogue, and introspection without clear connectors)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "proto-man" and its implications without sufficient context within the segment
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt end with "Ramsey felt thoughts of proto-man nibbling at his consciousness." without clear connection to the preceding action

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
