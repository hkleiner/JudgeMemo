Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "fickle fashion", "gallantry") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's artistic development to the detailed list of his works without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the social context and Fragonard's rise to fame could benefit from clearer connections to the preceding artistic analysis.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
