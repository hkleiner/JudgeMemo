Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, complex sentences (e.g., the first sentence of the "CHAPTER: INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" section)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "horse-car", "cravat tied in a flowing bowknot")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense (e.g., switching between past and past perfect in some paragraphs)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the Wayside Press narrative to the "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" chapter
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly verbose, slightly obscuring their main point (e.g., the description of the protagonist's attire)
- [LOGIC] The shift in tone from melancholic (end of Wayside Press) to jubilant (meeting with Richard Harding Davis) feels somewhat disjointed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
