Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "mighted be used" (incorrect verb form, should be "might be used")
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded possess" (incorrect verb form, should be "should possess")
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sentences (e.g., "thought-quickening trend", "stimulative influence") may hinder smooth reading for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the author's printing experiences and the description of the office location (could benefit from a clearer link)
- [CLARITY] The purpose of detailing the author's apron and initial meeting with Mr. Moses could be more clearly connected to the broader narrative arc.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
