Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I is listened" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "taubes" (inconsistent capitalization, should be "Taubes" if referring to the aircraft type)
- [LEXICON] "smug American" (potentially ambiguous without context, though understandable)
- [SYNTAX] "and, in the second place, a certain type..." (somewhat awkward transition)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from describing soldiers to discussing American reconstruction efforts without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from Nancy's description to the anecdote about Bulgarian princes)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge about "the Marne" and its significance without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
