Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple paragraphs (e.g., "If then, there is to be a festival...") 
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "goodwill" without variation 
- [SPELLING] "you woulded feel" (should be "you would feel") 
- [GRAMMAR] "the fault is not in the custom but in ourselves" (could be clearer with "ourselves" specified) 

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing social justice to introducing Christmas as a festival 
- [STRUCTURE] The section feels like two distinct essays (social justice & Christmas appropriateness) loosely connected 
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., "faith effervesces") without clear explanations for general readers 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
