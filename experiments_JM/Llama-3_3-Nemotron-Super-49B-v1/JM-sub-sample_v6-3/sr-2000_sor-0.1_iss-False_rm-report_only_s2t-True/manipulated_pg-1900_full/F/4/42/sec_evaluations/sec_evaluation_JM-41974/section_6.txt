Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", not present but "monumental buildings" and phrasing like "had had the palace adorn") might slightly hinder modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different aspects of Veronese's work and life without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Venetian geography and historical figures (e.g., Duke of Savoy, Emperor Rudolph II) could reduce clarity for some.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
