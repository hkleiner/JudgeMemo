Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or highly specialized vocabulary (e.g., "heteropathic laws", "ordinal correlation") could hinder understanding for non-experts.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few places (e.g., "we may was able" should be "we may be able").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with referenced authors' works (e.g., Spencer, Mill, Lewes) without brief context.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing emergent properties and the challenge to Spencer's unification goal.
- [CLARITY] Concept of "constitutive properties" could benefit from clearer differentiation from "additive properties" early on.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
