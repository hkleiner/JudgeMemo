Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "what do you suppose gravely walked out?" (should be "what do you suppose walked out gravely?" or similar for clarity)
- [SPELLING] "tewky" (likely a deliberate phonetic spelling, but may cause confusion)
- [LEXICON] "ben room" and "but room" could benefit from brief explanation for clarity to all readers
- [GRAMMAR] "Marjorie was delighted, for she have so often admired" (subject-verb agreement error: "she had admired")
- [GRAMMAR] "you can imagine how pleased Marjorie was." (informal, but not fluent in formal writing contexts)
- [SPELLING] "cheep" (likely intentional for sound effect, but may distract)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the walk to the party preparations
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "shepherd's plaid" without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from "Auld Wullie's" story to the gift of pebbles without clear connection
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps quickly from one scene to another without smooth transitions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
