Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing Oxford comma in several places) 

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with specific historical contexts (e.g., Muhammad's struggle, Bahá'u'lláh's mission) without brief clarification 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing ancient religious texts to modern societal issues (between paragraphs 3 and 4) 
- [CLARITY] Overly broad statements without specific examples (e.g., "moral, intellectual, cultural and economic achievement")
