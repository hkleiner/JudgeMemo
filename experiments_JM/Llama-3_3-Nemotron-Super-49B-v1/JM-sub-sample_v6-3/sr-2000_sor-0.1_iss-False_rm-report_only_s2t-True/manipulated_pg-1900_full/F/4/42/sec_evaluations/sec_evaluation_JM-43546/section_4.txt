Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "Boules and the button-game, where buttons was thrown..." (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] "the lassies am devoted chums" (incorrect verb form "am" instead of "are")
- [SPELLING] "cairngorm" (commonly spelled as "carnelian" or "topaz" in some contexts, though "cairngorm" is correct in Scottish context)
- [SYNTAX] "The little girls am much interested" (subject-verb agreement error, "are" instead of "am")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from game description to Doctor Gordon's call without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] Information about the Highland Regiment and its uniform feels somewhat tangential to the main narrative of the outing.
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps quickly between different points of interest in Edinburgh without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
