Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He had friends, but no confidantes.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "gall," "comportment" implied but not listed, "gilded coach" contextually clear but somewhat dated)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumps between biography, artistic philosophy, and historical context without clear transitions)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., "the quarrels and intrigues of the artists of the day") without brief explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
