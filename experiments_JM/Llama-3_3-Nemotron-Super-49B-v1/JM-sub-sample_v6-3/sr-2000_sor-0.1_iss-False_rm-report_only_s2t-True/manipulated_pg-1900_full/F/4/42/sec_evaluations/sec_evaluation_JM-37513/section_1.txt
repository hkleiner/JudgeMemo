Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "while I is still in my teens" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] "potted essence" (uncommon phrase, may cause slight confusion)
- [SYNTAX] "the more heterogeneous the products... the stronger the evidence for the law" (complex sentence structure, slightly hard to follow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the friend's lack of response implies ignorance of modern science (unproven)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's essay to evaluating his overall contributions (could be smoother)
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with multiple complex ideas (reduces readability)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
