Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "It is almost incredible how rapidly Becket became St. Thomas of Canterbury...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "sumpter-mule", "half-civilized nations")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the murder scene to the discussion of Becket's canonization process 
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the description of the monks' reaction to Becket's attire)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
