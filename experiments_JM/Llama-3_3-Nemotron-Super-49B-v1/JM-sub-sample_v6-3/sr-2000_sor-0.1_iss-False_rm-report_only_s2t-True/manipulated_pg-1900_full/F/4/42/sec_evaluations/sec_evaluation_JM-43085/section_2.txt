Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bourgais", "reliquary" not present but similar antiquated terms) might require additional mental processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different periods of Meissonier's life without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 19th-century French art and culture (e.g., immediate recognition of "The Indian Cabin" or "Paul and Virginia") could reduce clarity for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
