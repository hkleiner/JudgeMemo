Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure in some paragraphs (e.g., abrupt shifts between short and long sentences)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in certain descriptions (e.g., "vacuous benevolence", "radiant, fragrant vision") may hinder readability for some readers
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "It was his daily walk with Eileen, however, which introduced Excalibur to life--life in its broadest and most romantic sense. As I was not privileged to **was** present..." (redundant "was")
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "The parcel in question **contain**..." (should be "contained")
- [SPELLING/Grammar] Minor error: "I thought you must **had** been," (should be "must have been")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unannounced shift from describing Excalibur's daily activities to introducing a new character (the curate) without clear transitional context
- [CLARITY] Some sections assume prior knowledge of characters' relationships or context not provided in the evaluated segment (e.g., Eileen's absence and return)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the curate's breakfast scene to the narrative about Excalibur's role as a chaperon in "CHAPTER: V" without a clear link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
