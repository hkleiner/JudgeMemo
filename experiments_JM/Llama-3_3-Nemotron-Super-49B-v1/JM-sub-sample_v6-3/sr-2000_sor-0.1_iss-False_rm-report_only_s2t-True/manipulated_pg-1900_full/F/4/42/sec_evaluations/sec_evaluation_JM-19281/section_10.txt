Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "The process bears within itself...").
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic language ("behoovethed", "thou") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in "The revelation of Bahá'u'lláh... has been set in motion" (could imply ongoing action, whereas the context suggests a completed action).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the philosophical discussion and the introduction of the "CHAPTER" subtitle without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume prior knowledge of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and historical context, potentially confusing new readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between discussing the universal awakening of historical consciousness and the specifics of Bahá'u'lláh's message.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
