Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "ostentatiously", "unparalleled") might require additional effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different storylines (e.g., from Alashia to Napkhuria to Tushratta) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume prior knowledge of the characters' relationships and historical context, potentially confusing new readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
