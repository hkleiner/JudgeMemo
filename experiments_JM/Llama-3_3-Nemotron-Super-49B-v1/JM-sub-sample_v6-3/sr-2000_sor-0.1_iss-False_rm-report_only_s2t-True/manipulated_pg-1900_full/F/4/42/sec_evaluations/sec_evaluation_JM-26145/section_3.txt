Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded deceive" (should be "could deceive")
- [GRAMMAR] "measures that might was taken" (should be "measures that might be taken")
- [GRAMMAR] "ordered a military expedition" (should be "ordered a military expedition" - context suggests "to order" is correct, but "ordered" without "to" is slightly awkward)
- [GRAMMAR] "or to turned a sceptical ear" (should be "or to turn a sceptical ear")
- [GRAMMAR] "had made similar evasive excuses" (tense inconsistency in a paragraph, though not strictly incorrect in the broader context)
- [SPELLING] None detected in the current segment.
- [SYNTAX] "the stream of rhetorical devotion flowed on in the letters" (slightly awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "Pidati" and "Shirtani" lack immediate context for unfamiliar readers (though likely intentional for subject-specific terminology)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption about the impact of Egypt's distance without clear connection to preceding context within the segment.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Habiri's actions to the introduction of Akhenaten and the archives.
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the explanation of matrimonial alliances and divine honours).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between the end of the historical analysis and the start of "CHAPTER: III. LETTERS FROM ASIATIC KINGS."
- [CONSISTENCY] Tense shifts in narrative voice (e.g., moving between past and a more analytical present without clear markers).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
