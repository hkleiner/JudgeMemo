Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "In virtue of its 'inheritance from the past', it would continue at uniform velocity in one direction.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fire-mist", "cognita")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in verb tense ("was" instead of "were" in "We take them as they was given")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions without clear evidence (e.g., the nature of "awareness" in non-human entities)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing physiological and cognitive processes without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient explanation for general understanding (e.g., "heredity-relatedness")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
