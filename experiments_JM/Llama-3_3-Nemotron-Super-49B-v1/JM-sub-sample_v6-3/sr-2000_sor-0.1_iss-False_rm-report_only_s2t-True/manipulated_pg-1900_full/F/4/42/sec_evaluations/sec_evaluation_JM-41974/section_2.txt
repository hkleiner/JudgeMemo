Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "How could he had failed" (should be "How could he have failed")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similarly nuanced adjectives (e.g., "sumptuous", "luxuriously", "precious", "copious") without sufficient variation
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "If he wish to paint a Last Supper...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Veronese's artistic style to discussing his personal life without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about specific art historical references (e.g., "the great Titian", "Sansovino") without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs, especially when shifting from artistic analysis to biographical details

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
