Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "I had been told at Châlons that it was the “least bad,” and started off with resignation."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some contexts (e.g., "surging mass of soldiers", "incursions") may hinder smooth reading for general audiences.
- [SPELLING] "taube" (should be "Taube" for proper noun, the German aircraft)
- [GRAMMAR] "as I is the only stranger" (should be "as I was")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the town's layout to discussing air raid precautions without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Overly descriptive passages (e.g., the walk to the hotel) slow the narrative without significantly advancing the plot or character development.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the hotel search to the commentary on French politeness feels disconnected from the immediate context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
