Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent sentence structure (e.g., "And could not stop Garr Symm from ran past them")
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "tremulously", while not incorrect, may detract from fluency for some readers)
- [PUNCTUATION] Potential overuse of simple punctuation (e.g., multiple consecutive sentences ending with "!")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained transformation of Garr Symm without clear setup
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from action to philosophical explanation (Vardin's backstory)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the explanation of the "equation" and its implications

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
