Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "As the glovemaker looked out...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for modern readers (e.g., "bewigged", "fopperies")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from detailed biographical/historical context to the sudden, pivotal event ("bolt from the blue") without clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the timeline of events (e.g., the exact timing and impact of historical events on the protagonist's life could be clearer)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
