Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stultify", "inimical") might require additional effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing religious evolution and the parable of the landowner, while thematic, feels somewhat abrupt without clearer contextual bridging.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between addressing objections, explaining evolutionary religion, and critiquing theological presumption without a fully cohesive narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
