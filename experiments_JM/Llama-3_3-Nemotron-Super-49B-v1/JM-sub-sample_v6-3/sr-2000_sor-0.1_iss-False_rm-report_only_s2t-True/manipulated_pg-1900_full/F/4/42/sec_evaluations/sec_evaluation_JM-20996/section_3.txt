Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the necessity of easy communication... was rendered somewhat less indispensable" 
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "dizzy heights of his climaxes", "send us nerve dispatches")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the social event to focusing on food without clear transition 
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the "baile" and its significance could be more clearly established at the outset

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
