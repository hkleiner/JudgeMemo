Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "to-morrow") might hinder readability for modern readers.
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistency in hyphenation (e.g., "to-morrow" vs. contemporary "tomorrow").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced artworks without introduction.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing artistic style to introducing "Millet's Early Life" without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] The text blends analysis, biography, and art criticism without a clear sectioning or transition to guide the reader through the shift in focus.
