Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was arranged that the house should be shut up and the children sent to their grandmother at Bath.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and ill-balanced body", "leonine head") might require additional processing for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the emotional goodbye scene to the sudden, unrelated event in Chapter VII ("THE coroner's jury...") without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The narrative leap from Excalibur's pursuit of the taxi to the detailed account of the train accident lacks a smooth transitional explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
