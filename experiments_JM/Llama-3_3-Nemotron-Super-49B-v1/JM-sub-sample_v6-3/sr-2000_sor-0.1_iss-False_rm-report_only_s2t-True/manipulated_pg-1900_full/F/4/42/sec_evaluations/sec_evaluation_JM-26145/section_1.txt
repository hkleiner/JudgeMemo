- [LEXICON] "dusky fellows" (potentially outdated or offensive terminology)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing tablet findings and shifting focus to the Egyptian Court in Chapter II without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events without brief introduction for potentially uninformed readers.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs, especially when moving from the discovery of tablets to the discussion of the Egyptian kings.
