Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "what appeared to was a dense early morning fog" (incorrect verb conjugation)
- [SPELLING] "arrive" (should be "arrived")
- [SYNTAX] "Youhad got to be" (typo, should be "You've got to be")
- [LEXICON] "several hundred yards across the Graveyard" (vagueness, could be more precise for sci-fi context)
- [GRAMMAR] "excepted followed them" (should be "except follow them" or similar)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Enterprise's preparations to Dog Star's crew without clear connection (initially)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear time explanation within dialogue disrupts flow slightly
- [CLARITY] Overly complex hyper-space explanations might confuse some readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from technical discussion to "The Enterprise...." (lacking smooth transition)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
