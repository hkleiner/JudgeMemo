Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" (incorrect past tense of "would")
- [SPELLING] "prosperity" (contextually correct, but in the given sentence, "prosperity" might be less fitting than "financial success" for clarity, however, this is more of a [LEXICON] issue)
- [LEXICON] "prosperity" (as mentioned, slightly less clear in context)
- [SYNTAX] "It seemed that after such a picture, it would be impossible for Rosa Bonheur to rise to a greater height of perfection." (somewhat formal and slightly awkward in a modern context, but not significantly impairing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing "Ploughing in the Nivernais" to the detailed description of "Horse Fair" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed financial transaction regarding "Horse Fair" might confuse readers unfamiliar with the art market of the time.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from "Horse Fair"'s success to the new studio in "The Years of Glory" chapter feels somewhat disconnected without a bridging sentence about the timeline or reason for the move.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
