Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "may I went to work" (should be "may I go to work")
- [SPELLING] "caednâ€™t" (should be "couldn't")
- [LEXICON] "was an artist" (should be "be an artist")
- [SYNTAX] "You are had trouble with arithmetic" (should be "You had trouble with arithmetic")
- [GRAMMAR] "was receiving fifteen dollars a week" (tense inconsistency, should be consistent throughout)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the print shop to introducing Frank Bromley
- [CLARITY] Unclear timeline in the transition from the print shop to the Chicago sojourns (could benefit from clearer temporal markers)
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from apprenticeship struggles to the discovery about wood-engravers without designers, feeling somewhat disconnected
- [TRANSITION] The end of the "First Sojourn" and the beginning of the "Second Sojourn" could be more smoothly connected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
