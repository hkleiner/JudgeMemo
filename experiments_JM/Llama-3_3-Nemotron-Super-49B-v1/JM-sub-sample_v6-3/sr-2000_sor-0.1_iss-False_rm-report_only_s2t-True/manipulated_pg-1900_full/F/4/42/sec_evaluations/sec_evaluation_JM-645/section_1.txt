Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional cognitive effort for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between past and present reflections without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Subtle, implied character motivations and relationships (e.g., Corvick's true beliefs about Gwendolen) could benefit from slightly more explicit handling for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
