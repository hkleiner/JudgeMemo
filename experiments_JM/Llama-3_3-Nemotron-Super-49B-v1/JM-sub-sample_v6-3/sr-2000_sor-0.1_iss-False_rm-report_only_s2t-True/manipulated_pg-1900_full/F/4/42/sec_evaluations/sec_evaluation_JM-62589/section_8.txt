Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the army was divide" (should be "divided")
- [SPELLING] "did" (should be "to do" in "there is one thing more to did")
- [LEXICON] "maddened Hessians" (could be more clearly introduced for unfamiliar readers)
- [SYNTAX] "sickness and cold were enfeebling the patriot army day by day" (wordy, could be more concise)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from battle description to Robert's memories without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative within the segment (e.g., jumping between Robert's actions and broader army movements) without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about characters (e.g., "Molly") and events (e.g., Robert's search for someone) without context in this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
