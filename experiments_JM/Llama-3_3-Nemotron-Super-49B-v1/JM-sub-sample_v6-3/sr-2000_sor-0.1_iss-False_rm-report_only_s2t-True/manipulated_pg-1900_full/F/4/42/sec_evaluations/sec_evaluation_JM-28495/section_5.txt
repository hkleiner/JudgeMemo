Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Panic-stricken, he run to his mistress" (subject-verb agreement error: should be "ran")
- [SPELLING] "It woulded mean starvation" (typo: should be "would mean")
- [SYNTAX] "Excalibur was so unstrung by this adventure that he ran back to where he had left Eileen and the curate." (could be rephrased for smoother flow, though not strictly incorrect)
- [LEXICON] "coram populo" (while correct, may be less familiar to some readers, potentially disrupting fluency for those unfamiliar with the Latin phrase)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from Excalibur's encounter with the hare to Eileen and the curate's conversation feels abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between Excalibur's adventures and the couple's serious discussion without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The curate's statement about the hardships of living on a hundred pounds a year, while clear in intent, assumes a level of familiarity with the economic challenges of the clergy that some readers might not share.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
