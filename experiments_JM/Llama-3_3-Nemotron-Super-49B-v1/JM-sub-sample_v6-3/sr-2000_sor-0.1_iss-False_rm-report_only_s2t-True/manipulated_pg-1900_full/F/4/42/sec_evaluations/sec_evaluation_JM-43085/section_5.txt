Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple paragraphs (e.g., "It is precisely this difference...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "faggots", "bespangled", "bonbonni√®res").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "Meissonier rediscovered...We get...").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing specific artworks to the "CHAPTER: MILITARY PAINTINGS" section without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with multiple artwork descriptions, potentially overwhelming the reader.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the detailed analysis of artworks and the biographical sketch of Meissonier's military involvement.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
