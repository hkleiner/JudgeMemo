Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The revolted brutality and vacancy of that face haunts the imagination.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "quasi-classic", "amelioration", "inured") might require additional effort for comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between biographical narrative, artistic analysis, and philosophical interpretation without clear transitional markers
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of art history and specific artworks (e.g., "The marvellous 'Breaking the Clod'") could reduce clarity for uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
