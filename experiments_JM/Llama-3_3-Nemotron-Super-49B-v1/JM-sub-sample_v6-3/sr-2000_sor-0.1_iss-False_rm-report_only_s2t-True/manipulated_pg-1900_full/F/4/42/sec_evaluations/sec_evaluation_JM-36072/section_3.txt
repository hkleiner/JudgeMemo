Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "The problem of mending or ending industrialism...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "solatium", "potations", "apoplexy").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor error: "coulded" (should be "could").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Universities and the Civil Service.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, making the connection to the overall theme less obvious.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between different departmental improvements (e.g., from Law to Universities).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
