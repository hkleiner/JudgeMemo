Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "had lain", "was consume", "woulded know")
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "gaby", "thou", "wert")
- [SPELLING] Minor typo ("was decent and respectable slipping from her" - missing preposition for clarity, though not strictly a spelling error)
- [GRAMMAR] "If she had only been a boy she would have fought against him simply to spite her mistress." (Conditional tense inconsistency, though contextually clear)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Debby's emotional reflection to the decision to disguise as a boy (could benefit from a smoother transition)
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of Chapter III without a clear narrative bridge from Chapter II's ending
- [CLARITY] Assumption of external context (e.g., the significance of the King, the battles mentioned) without brief clarification for standalone readability

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
