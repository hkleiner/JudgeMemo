Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "per impossibile", "puerile") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing Jewish election and comparing with other nations (e.g., America, England) could be more explicitly connected.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from theological discussions to historical examples (e.g., from Jehuda Ha-Levi to the Pilgrim Fathers) is somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
