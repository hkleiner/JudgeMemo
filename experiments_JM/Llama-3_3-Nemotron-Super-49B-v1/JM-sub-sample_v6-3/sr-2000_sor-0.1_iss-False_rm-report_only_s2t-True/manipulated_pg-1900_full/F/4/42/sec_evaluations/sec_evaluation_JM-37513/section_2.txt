Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It is true that the affairs of the mind give pause and seem to present something of a difficulty.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "fain", "thou", "whilst" implied in tone, though not directly used)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense ("We can think... We can thought")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning in discussing the Unknowable (e.g., asserting its existence without clear justification)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between criticizing Spencer's vagueness and discussing science's scope
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient elaboration for clarity (e.g., the distinction between Spencer's "Force" and scientific terminology)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
