Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The next morning you **was** seated..." (subject-verb agreement error)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of simplistic vocabulary in descriptive sections (e.g., "glorious departure", "thrilling work") without adding depth
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure for modern reading standards (e.g., "You tell him you havenâ€™t eaten since the previous night." could be more fluidly integrated)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different time periods and topics (e.g., from the snowstorm to the printing plant without clear connection)
- [CLARITY] Some sections assume prior knowledge of historical context or printing terminology that might confuse modern readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal or thematic connectors between paragraphs

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
