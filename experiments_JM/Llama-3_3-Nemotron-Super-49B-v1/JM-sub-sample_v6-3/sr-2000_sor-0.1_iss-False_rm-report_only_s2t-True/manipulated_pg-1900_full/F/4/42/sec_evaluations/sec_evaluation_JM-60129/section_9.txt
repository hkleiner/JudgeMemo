Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "You see them, humming a scrap of song, making their way carefully through the tightly packed flock of sheep, carrying one or two lambs under their arms, kissing and caressing the bleating animals.")
- [LEXICON] Some terms (e.g., "kekliks", "t'umu", "ch√ºn") assume prior knowledge without explanation within the segment.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between descriptive scenes and informational passages could be smoother (e.g., abrupt shift from daily life to tent description).
- [CLARITY] Assumed context for some practices (e.g., chanting prayers at "praying places") without brief elaboration within the segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
