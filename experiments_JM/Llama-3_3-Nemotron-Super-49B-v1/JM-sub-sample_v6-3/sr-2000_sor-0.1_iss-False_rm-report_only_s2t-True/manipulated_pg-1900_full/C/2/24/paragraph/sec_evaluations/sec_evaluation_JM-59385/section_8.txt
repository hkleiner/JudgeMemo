Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was then that she began to teach foreigners Chinese.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "cubby hole", "Hatamen Street", "Lung Fa Fsu") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the narrator's introduction to the detailed backstory of Kuei Ping without a clear connecting device.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative (jumping between Kuei Ping's life events and the narrator's present) may confuse without prior context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
