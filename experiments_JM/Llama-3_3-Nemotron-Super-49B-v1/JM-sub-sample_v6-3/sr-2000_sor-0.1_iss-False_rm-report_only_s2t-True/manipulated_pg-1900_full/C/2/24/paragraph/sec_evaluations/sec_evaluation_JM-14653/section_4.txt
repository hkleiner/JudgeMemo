Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "But the accompaniments of the feast are also excessive...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sirocco", "rejuvenators") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from defending feasting to critiquing the sceptic's potential festival alternatives feels slightly abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between philosophical defense, descriptive examples, and sarcastic counter-proposals, which, while engaging, slightly disrupts a linear coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
