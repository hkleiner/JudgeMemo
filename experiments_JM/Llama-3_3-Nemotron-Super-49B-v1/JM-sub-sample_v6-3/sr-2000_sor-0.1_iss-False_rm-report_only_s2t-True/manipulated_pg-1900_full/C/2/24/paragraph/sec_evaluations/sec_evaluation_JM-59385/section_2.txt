Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The utter futility of attempting to make East and West understand each other had stilled her lips...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full comprehension (e.g., "soothsayers", "cyclic animals").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Kuei Ping's memories to the detailed description of her wedding preparations without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The shift in time and setting (from memories to the wedding scene) could be more smoothly signaled to enhance reader flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
