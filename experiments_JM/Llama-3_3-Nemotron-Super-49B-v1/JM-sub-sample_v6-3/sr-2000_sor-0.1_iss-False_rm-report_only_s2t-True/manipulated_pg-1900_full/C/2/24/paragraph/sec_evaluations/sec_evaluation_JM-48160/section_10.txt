Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] Multiple minor spelling corrections noted (e.g., "euphenism", "miliary", "uremitting", "volunatry", "mininum", "flowering shrugs")
- [SYNTAX] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "the distant soldier suffering in grateful silence for “The Eternal France”")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., "raucous voice of war" is poetic but slightly unclear in context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing hospital conditions and the financial state of French nobles
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the text (appeal for donations) emerges somewhat late and could be more clearly integrated throughout
- [TRANSITION] The sentence "The automated gate slid open." feels disconnected from the surrounding narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
