Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "We have seen how important and essential a part Russia played in the overthrow of German militarism.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases ("...will always remain...", "will always be...")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptive leap regarding future Russia's power without clear evidence
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from historical context to speculative future scenarios (between paragraphs discussing 1918 and projecting future European dynamics)
