Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "intractable", "condign", "draconian") might hinder readability for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing religious texts to "A fax was received without delay" disrupts the logical flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between various religious examples and broader societal commentary without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
