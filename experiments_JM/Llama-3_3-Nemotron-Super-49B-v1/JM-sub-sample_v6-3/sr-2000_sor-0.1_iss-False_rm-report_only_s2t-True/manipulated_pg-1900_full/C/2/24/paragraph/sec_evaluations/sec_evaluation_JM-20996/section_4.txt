Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dulce", "St. Vitus", "Terpsichore") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the dinner and dance to discussing household management in the Philippines without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Filipino customs and St. Vitus without brief explanation for unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
