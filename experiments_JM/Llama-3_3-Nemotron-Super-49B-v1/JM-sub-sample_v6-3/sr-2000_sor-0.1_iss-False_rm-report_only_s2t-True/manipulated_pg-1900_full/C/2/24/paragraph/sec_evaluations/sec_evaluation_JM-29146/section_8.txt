Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He wondered if he could chance rushing her but told himself she meant what she said." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
  - [LEXICON] Overuse of simplistic dialogue tags (e.g., "said", "cried", "smiled") without variation
  - [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense in "Ramsey's face went white. / 'One,' Margot said." (consider adding a transition for better flow)

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Garr Symm's decision to follow the Enterprise without clear motivation
  - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Ramsey's internal monologue and the revelation about time's impact on the environment
  - [CLARITY] Overly complex, unexplained concept ("time does not exist in hyper-space") without sufficient setup for immediate understanding

3. FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
