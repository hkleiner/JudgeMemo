Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "It is only in sympathetically contemplating others that one can get oneself in a true perspective.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "exacerbation", "teleport pad" seems out of context and jarring)
- [LENGTH] Some sentences are excessively long, potentially hindering smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion to "The teleport pad dimmed after use" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential introduction of the "Feast of St. Friend" concept; could benefit from clearer buildup
- [LOGIC] Assumption that practicing goodwill leads to increased happiness might feel too conclusive without prior evidence in this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
