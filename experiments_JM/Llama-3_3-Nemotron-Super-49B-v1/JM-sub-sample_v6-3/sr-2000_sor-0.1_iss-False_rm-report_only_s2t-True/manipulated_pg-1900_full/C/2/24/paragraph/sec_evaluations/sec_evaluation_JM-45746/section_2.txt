Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some vocabulary choices (e.g., "coveted position", "ill will of a part of the community") might be less common in contemporary writing, potentially affecting readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between personal anecdote, educational advice, and administrative tasks without a clear thematic connector.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to guide the reader through the narrative and thematic shifts.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
