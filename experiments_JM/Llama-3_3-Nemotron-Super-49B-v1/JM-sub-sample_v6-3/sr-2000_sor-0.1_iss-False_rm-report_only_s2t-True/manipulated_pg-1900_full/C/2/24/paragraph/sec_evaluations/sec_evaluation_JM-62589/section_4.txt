Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "A blur passed over Mason’s eyes. His senses became more muddled." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some dialogue (e.g., "God help me!", "I've been trying to ask you that ever since I first saw you") may feel less natural in modern context
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent dialogue tags/punctuation in a few instances (e.g., around "What—you—doing, hic—give the countersign—hic—or I’ll shoot!")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of "personal hovercraft" feels out of context and anachronistic for the historical setting
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Mason's plea to the introduction of the young Britisher without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Mason's recognition and confusion between Robert and "Captain Morley" could be clearer in its setup and payoff

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
