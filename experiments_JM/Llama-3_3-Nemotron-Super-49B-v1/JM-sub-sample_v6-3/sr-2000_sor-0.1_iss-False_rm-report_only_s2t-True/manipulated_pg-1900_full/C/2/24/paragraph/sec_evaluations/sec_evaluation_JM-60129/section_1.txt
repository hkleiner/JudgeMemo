Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "etappe stations", "Kuzurkei") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between descriptive narrative, cultural insight, and geographical detail without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of regional geography and cultural groups (e.g., Tangutans, Sarts) could affect understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
