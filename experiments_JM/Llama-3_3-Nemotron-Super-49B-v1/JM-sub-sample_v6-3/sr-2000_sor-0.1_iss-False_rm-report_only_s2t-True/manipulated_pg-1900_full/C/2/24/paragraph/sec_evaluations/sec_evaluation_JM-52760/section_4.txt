Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Although digging in the countermines continued throughout July, Confederate fears seemed to lessen during the same period.")
- [LEXICON] Some technical or historical terms (e.g., "mini√© balls") might require explanation for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from detailing the tunnel's construction to discussing the battle plan and outcome (could benefit from a clearer thematic bridge).
- [CLARITY] The inclusion of unrelated, modern elements (e.g., "A notification chimed twice.", "A tablet lit up on the table.", "A smart bulb changed color.") disrupts the historical narrative's coherence and clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
