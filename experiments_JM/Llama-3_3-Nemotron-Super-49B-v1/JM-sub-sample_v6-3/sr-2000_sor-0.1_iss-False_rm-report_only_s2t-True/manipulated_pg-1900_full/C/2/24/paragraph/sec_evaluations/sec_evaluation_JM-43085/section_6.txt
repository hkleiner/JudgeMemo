Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and descriptive analysis (e.g., shift from Emperor's conversation to artistic critique)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "mephistophelian", "resplendent", "literal-minded")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and present in descriptive sections)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., from Fontainebleau to Eleven years later without clear transitional phrase)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events without brief context (e.g., "the year of terror", "Marmot")
- [TRANSITION] Sudden, unconnected introduction of unrelated elements (e.g., "A hologram displayed the weather", "A power cycle reset the panel")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
