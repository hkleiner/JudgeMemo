Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Life was beginning in tragedy; and no doubt twenty years hence they will be as torn with anxiety for their absent sons." (could be split for clarity)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary might hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "estaminet", "terrasse", "smug")
- [SPELLING] No issues detected
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "If I was forced..." (could be "were" for formal subjunctive, though "was" is commonly accepted in informal contexts)
- [ANACHRONISM] Presence of "touchscreen panel", "teleport pad", and "hologram" in a WWI context (severely disrupts historical fluency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing soldiers to discussing Bulgarian princes without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and somewhat disjointed narrative flow (e.g., jumping between Nancy, the war zone, and future reconstruction plans)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of "the Marne" and its significance without brief context for potentially uninformed readers
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from harvesting soldiers to hotel scenes)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
