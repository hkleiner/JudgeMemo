Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., "It was like the rush of a fire-engine, plus twice the speed, and twenty times the danger.")
- [LEXICON] Informal language and slang (e.g., "Hell-a-whooping", "cuss") may affect readability for some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Occasional lack of commas in dialogue tags could improve clarity (e.g., "Curse it all Billy" should be "Curse it all, Billy")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ches' fall to the captain's immediate response without a clear time gap
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the record trip for eight miles in a wagon in that country" assumes prior knowledge of the country's challenges
- [LOGIC] The captain's decision to "stop to timber" despite Bud's urgency could be more clearly justified within the text

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
