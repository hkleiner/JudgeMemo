Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "What she had left of material things would last until the news of her departure reached the Chia compound.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full understanding (e.g., "hutungs", "Hatamen Street", "amah")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances (e.g., switching between past simple and past perfect without clear narrative justification)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Kuei Ping's departure preparations to her spiritual awakening without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The character development of Fuh Tang's decline feels somewhat disconnected from Kuei Ping's journey in this segment
- [TRANSITION] The inclusion of futuristic elements (e.g., "the laser display turned off automatically") disrupts the otherwise consistent historical setting, causing contextual confusion

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
