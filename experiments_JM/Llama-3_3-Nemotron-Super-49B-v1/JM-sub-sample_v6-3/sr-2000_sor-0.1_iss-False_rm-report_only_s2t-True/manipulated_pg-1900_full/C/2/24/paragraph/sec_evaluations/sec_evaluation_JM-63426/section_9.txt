Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "While it is true...") may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sparsely equipped print-ship", "fussy and valueless detail") might require a brief pause for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between personal anecdote, industry commentary, and biographical elements without clear transitional phrases, potentially disrupting flow.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences assume prior knowledge of the printing/design industry or the author's context (e.g., "the growing importance of offset printing"), which could confuse uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
