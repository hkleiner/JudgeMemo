Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The Frenchman, good judge that he is in matters of art, duly admires a beautiful work, regardless of its subject; he is able to appreciate the composition of an agricultural scene, but, being little inclined by nature to the work of the fields, he will rarely feel a desire to adorn the walls of his apartment with a Harvest Scene or Grazing Cattle; he assumes that it is the business of the museums to acquire pictures of this order.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "veritable", "gazelles", "moufflons", "grunting ox of Tartary") might require additional context or familiarity for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the artist's menagerie and success to the detailed list of animals in the new studio at By, disrupting the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about French vs. English appreciation for rural life, while insightful, feels somewhat tangential to the immediate narrative of Rosa Bonheur's life and career progression.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
