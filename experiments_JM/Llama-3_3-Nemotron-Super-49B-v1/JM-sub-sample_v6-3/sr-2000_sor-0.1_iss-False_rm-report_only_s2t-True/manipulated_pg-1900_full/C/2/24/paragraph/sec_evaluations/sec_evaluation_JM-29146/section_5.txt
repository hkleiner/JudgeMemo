Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "If you do, and if you succeed, more power will be yours than a human being has ever before had in the galaxy.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "Sirian-archaic", "digital fabric shifted colors")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and present in different sections)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from scientific discussion to personal relationship dynamics without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt change in scene (from letter to Ramsey's actions) without preparatory paragraph or clear time indicator
- [CLARITY] Some assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of the galaxy's setup and terms (e.g., "Spacer Graveyard", "Canopusian freighter")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
