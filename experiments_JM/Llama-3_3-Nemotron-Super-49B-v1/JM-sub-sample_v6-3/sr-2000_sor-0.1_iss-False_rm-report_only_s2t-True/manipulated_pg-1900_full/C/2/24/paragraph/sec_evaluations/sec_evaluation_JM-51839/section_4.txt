Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may hinder immediate clarity (e.g., long lists of names without clear contextual transitions).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "e-ink wallpaper", "paroxysm of panic") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from historical narrative to listing town names without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain historical figures and events without brief introductions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
