Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The robotic arm sorted the tools." (disruptive, unrelated action)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "promiscuous contact", "tactless brutes")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "was" and "would have" in close proximity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition with "The AI core recalibrated the system." (unrelated, disruptive)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., discussing "Horse Fair" before fully concluding "Ploughing in the Nivernais" context)
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed description of "Horse Fair" sale history may confuse without prior context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
