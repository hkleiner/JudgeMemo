Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "She saw thus now because she measured their love not by her need of him, but by his need of her.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutung", "gateman") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between introspective moments and descriptive scenes without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The poem-like inserts ("Wherein...") disrupt the narrative flow and their connection to the story is not immediately clear.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
