Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some terminology (e.g., "intoxicating in the possibilities it opens") might be less common, potentially slowing reading flow for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing global governance to the power of unity could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes a level of familiarity with Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and the Bahá'í community, which might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
