Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The storm had been muttering and growling its curses for years before the death of Louis the Fifteenth.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full understanding (e.g., "Ã  la lanterne")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's personal life to the broader historical context of the Revolution (e.g., the shift after "He nearly killed him.")
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures and events (e.g., the significance of Mirabeau's death, the roles of various political groups)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
