Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, potentially distracting)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "thith" and similar lisp representations (may disrupt flow for some readers)
- [SYNTAX] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing articles or overly simplistic sentence structures in dialogue)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's interaction with the Security Officer to the introduction of the Earthgirl's thoughts
- [CLARITY] The Earthgirl's ability to "read Chind Ramar's mind" is introduced without prior context or explanation
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the spaceport scene to the Englanders' flat without a clear temporal or spatial bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
