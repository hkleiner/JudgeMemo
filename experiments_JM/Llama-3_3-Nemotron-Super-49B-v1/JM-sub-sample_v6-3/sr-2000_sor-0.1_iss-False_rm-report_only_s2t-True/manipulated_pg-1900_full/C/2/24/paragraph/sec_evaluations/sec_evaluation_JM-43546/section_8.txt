Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "One morning a shrill whistle brought Sandy to his garden wall." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("Whist!", "What's up?") may not align with the rest of the narrative's tone in some readers' opinions, though it suits the dialogue context.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "Our crowd is going to be at the top of the street" (could be "Our group" for consistency with "the Irish lads")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing St. Patrick's Day customs to the specific battle scenario without clear contextual setup within this segment.
- [CLARITY] Assumes prior knowledge of the significance of blue and green ribbons without explicit explanation in this context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
