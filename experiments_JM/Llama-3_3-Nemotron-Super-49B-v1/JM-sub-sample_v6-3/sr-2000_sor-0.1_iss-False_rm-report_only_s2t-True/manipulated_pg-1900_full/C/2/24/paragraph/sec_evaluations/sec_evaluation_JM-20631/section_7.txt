Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "volitional verities", "asphyxiation of the individual") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing Israel's covenant and jumping into comparisons with Japan and Prussia feels somewhat abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The text frequently shifts between historical, philosophical, and comparative analysis without clear transitional markers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
