Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Meantime upstairs in the first-floor front the curate, lying in his uncomfortable flock bed, was saying:--" (lacks transitional phrase)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some dialogues (e.g., "I should like to be introduced to your fianc√©e some day") may feel less natural in modern context
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "in first-floor front" (should be "the first-floor front")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the train accident to the scene in Pilgrim Street without clear temporal marker
- [CLARITY] The character "Mary Ellen" is introduced abruptly without prior context or explanation of her significance
- [LOGIC] The tramp's appearance at the end feels disconnected from the rest of the evaluated segment without further context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
