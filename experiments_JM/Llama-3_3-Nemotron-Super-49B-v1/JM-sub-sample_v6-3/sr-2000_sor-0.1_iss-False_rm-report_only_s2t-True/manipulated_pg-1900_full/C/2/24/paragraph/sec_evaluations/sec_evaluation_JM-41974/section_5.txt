Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ennobled", "solicit", "emulously") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Veronese's return to Venice and the detailed description of "The Family of Darius" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about rolling up the canvas, while engaging, slightly disrupts the flow of biographical and artistic analysis without clear relevance signaled to the broader narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
