Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward sentence structure in "Of course, the first part they visited were the rooms..." (subject-verb agreement)
- [LEXICON] Informal tone ("lads", "lassies", "bawbee") may not suit all readers, but is contextually appropriate
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in "The children were always greatly interested... they always looked" (past simple and past continuous)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Holyrood Palace to introducing the "CHAPTER: ANOTHER WALK IN EDINBURGH AND A VISIT TO ABBOTSFORD" without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the 'Dog's Monument'" without introduction
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of "The monitoring device recorded the metrics." without context or relevance to the narrative

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
