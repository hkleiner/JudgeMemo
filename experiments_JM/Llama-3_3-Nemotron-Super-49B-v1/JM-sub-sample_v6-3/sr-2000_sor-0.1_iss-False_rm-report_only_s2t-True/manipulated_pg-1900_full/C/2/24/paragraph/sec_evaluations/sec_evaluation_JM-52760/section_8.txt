Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "desperateness") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the detailed battle description and the analytical paragraph about the significance of Five Forks could be more seamless.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from the battle narrative to the future reflection by Lt. Col. Horace Porter, 30 years later, might confuse some readers without clearer transitional phrasing.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
