Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, affecting flow.
- [LEXICON] Occasional word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern narrative writing (e.g., "maddened Hessians", "stifling a groan").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from the battle scene to the council of war feels somewhat abrupt without clearer temporal or spatial cues.
- [CLARITY] Robert's backstory (e.g., the still form beside a lonely road, searching for a boy) is introduced without prior context in this segment, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
