Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "enrag√©s", "pygmies") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing foreign politics to the Victorian Age's intellectual movements without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The digression on Victorian figures' portraits, while engaging, slightly disrupts the flow of the main narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
