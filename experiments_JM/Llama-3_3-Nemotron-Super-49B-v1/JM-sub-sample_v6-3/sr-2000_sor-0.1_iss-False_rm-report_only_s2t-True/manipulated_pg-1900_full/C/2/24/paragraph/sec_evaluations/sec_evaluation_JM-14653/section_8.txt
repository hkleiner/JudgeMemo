Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "savour", "sine qua non", "exasperation") might require additional cognitive effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from philosophical discussion to the specific example of Christmas ("the Feast of St. Friend") feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding argument.
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the final paragraph ("You must...") appears abrupt, lacking a smoother connection to the preceding philosophical reflections.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
