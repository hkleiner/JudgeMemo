1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "wa'n't", "sence", "nigh") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from planning a funeral to Lyddy's backstory without a clear connecting device.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with unrelated details, potentially causing reader disorientation.
