Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "sacerdotal sovereignty", "fussiness and preciosity") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing etchings to paintings (at "But what of his paintings?") could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The philosophical detour regarding the size of Meissonier's paintings, while engaging, slightly delays the narrative's progression.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
