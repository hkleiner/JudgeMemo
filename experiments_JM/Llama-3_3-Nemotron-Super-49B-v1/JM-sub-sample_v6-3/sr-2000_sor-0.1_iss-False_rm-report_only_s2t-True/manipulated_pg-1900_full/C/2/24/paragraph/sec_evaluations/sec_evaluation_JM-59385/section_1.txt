Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe") might slightly hinder readability for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to "The hologram flickered to life" without clear contextual connection.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jump ("It was graduation day") feels disconnected from the preceding detailed scene without transitional context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
