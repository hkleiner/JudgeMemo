- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "enamoured", "innumerable tasks") might require a brief pause for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the artist's life at By to discussing the art school period (1849) without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of mentioning "A digital display counted down silently" is unclear and disrupts the narrative flow.
