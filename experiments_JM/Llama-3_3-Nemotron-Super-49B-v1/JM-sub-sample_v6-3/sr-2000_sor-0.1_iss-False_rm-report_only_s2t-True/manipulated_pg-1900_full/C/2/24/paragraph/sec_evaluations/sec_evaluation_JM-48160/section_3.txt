Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly long, convoluted sentences (e.g., describing the walk to Hotel du Commerce)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "surging mass of soldiers", "taube")
- [PUNCTUATION] Infrequent but noticeable lack of commas for clarity in complex sentences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the hotel search to discussing French politeness norms
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "taube" without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Slight disconnect between the war zone description and the personal, mundane actions (e.g., reading a novel)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
