Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "A keyboard clicked without being touched." and the subsequent paragraph.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sentences (e.g., "insoluble and fearful mysteries", "brotherliness of men") may hinder readability for non-native or younger readers.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation or inconsistent spacing after some sentences (e.g., before "solstice, and that...").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The initial sentence "A keyboard clicked without being touched." seems unrelated to the rest of the segment, disrupting coherence.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing social justice to introducing Christmas without a clear connecting thought.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are overly long, making it difficult to follow the author's main point without a clear topic sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
