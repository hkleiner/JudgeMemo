Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "prodigal", "nimble feet") might slow some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's artistic period to the political scenario with Choiseul and the Jesuits.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs contain multiple, loosely connected ideas (e.g., Fragonard's work, historical events, and personal anecdotes) that could be more clearly segmented.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
