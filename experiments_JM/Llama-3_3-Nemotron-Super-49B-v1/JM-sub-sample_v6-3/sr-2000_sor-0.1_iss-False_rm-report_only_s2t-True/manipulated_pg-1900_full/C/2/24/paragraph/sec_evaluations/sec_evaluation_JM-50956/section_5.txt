Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the Brusilov offensive and introducing the "Salvation of Roumania" chapter without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain historical events (e.g., Verdun period, Mackensen's and Falkenhayn's invasion) without brief contextualization.
