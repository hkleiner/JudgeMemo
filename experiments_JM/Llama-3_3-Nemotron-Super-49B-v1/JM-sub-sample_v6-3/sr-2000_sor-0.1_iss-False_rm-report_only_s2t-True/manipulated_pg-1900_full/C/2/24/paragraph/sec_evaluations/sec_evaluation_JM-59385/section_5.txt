Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "The motion sensor caught a brief movement." feels disconnected)
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise for enhanced clarity (e.g., "weariness" used repeatedly without variation)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., sudden shifts from past to present in descriptive passages)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt introduction of unrelated elements (e.g., "The auto-cleaning system activated." without context)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential time jumps without clear transitions (e.g., the shift from Fuh Tang's illness to the opium use)
- [CLARITY] Overly vague descriptions of emotional states at times (e.g., "a great dread" without deeper exploration)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
