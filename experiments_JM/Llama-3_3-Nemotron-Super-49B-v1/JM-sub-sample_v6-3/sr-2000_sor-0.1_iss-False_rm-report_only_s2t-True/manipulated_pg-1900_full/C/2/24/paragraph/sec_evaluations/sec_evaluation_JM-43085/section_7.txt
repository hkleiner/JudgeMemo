Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "I discovered, in the little court adjoining the ch√¢let, Meissonier out in the blazing sunlight astride of a bench that did duty for a horse"
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "cumbered", "redingote", "breeches of white cashmere")
- [SPELLING] "nineteeth" should be "nineteenth"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Meissonier's sketching to discussing his collection and back to his working methods
- [CLARITY] The sentence "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions." seems out of place and unclear in its relevance
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the anecdote about the painting being slashed and the preceding discussion of historical accuracy

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
