Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "transfixed", "plunges") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive, historical, and somewhat philosophical reflections without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of historical figures (e.g., Prior Goldstone II, Henry VIII, Becket) and architectural terms without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
