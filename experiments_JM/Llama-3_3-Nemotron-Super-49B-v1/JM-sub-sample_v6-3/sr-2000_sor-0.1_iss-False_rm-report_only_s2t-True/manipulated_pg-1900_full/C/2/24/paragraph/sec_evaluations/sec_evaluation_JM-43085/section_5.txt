Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bespangled", "bonbonni√®res", "faggots") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's genre paintings to his military paintings without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about Napoleon III. feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding and following text, lacking a clear thematic or contextual bridge.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
