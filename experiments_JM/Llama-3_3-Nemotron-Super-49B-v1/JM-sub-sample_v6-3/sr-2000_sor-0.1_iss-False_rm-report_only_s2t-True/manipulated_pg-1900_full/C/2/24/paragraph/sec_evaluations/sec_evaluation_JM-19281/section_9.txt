Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "If unity is indeed the litmus test of human progress...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "nethermost", "unconstrained")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between discussing evil's nature and the importance of unity without a clear connector 
- [STRUCTURE] The section could benefit from clearer subsection headings or transitional phrases to guide the reader through the varied topics 

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
