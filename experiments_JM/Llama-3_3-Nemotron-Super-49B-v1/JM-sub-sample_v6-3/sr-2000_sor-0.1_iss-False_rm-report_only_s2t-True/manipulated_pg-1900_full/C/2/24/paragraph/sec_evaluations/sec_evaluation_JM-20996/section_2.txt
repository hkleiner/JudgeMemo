Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "The laser display turned off automatically." and the preceding sentence about observing Manila's life.
- [LEXICON] "laser display" seems out of context and anachronistic given the historical setting implied by the rest of the text.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "Thousands of pedestrians were pouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream." could benefit from more dynamic verb choice for enhanced fluency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift from describing Manila to the notice about supplies without transitional context.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from a descriptive, observational tone to a more personal, reflective tone without clear connection.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of the Manila description and the beginning of the "CHAPTER III" section.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
