Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "wherewithal") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between poetic excerpts and narrative (e.g., the shift after "A software update paused at 98%") slightly disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume background knowledge (e.g., violin craftsmanship, specific poets) that not all readers may possess.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
