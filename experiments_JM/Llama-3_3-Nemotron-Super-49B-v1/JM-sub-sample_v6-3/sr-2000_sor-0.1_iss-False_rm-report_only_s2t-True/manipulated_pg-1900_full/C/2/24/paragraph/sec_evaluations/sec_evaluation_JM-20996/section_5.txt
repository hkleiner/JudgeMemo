Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "vehiclo", "coupe de main") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing life in Manila and the quiet hamlet without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The shift in focus from lifestyle contrasts to the specific arrangement in a Filipino sitting-room feels somewhat disconnected without a transitional paragraph.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
