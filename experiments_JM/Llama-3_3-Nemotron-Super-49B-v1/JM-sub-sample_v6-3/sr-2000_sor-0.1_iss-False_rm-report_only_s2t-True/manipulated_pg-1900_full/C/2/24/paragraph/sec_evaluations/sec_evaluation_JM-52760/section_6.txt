Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The enlisted men of both armies, however, remained largely unaware of the strategy of their commanders." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "unbroken campaign", "demoralizing effects")
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in complex sentences (e.g., "The men of both sides had much in common, despite the bitterness with which they fought, but in camp they were on the same common level.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Battle of Hatcher’s Run to the daily life of soldiers (could benefit from a clearer connecting sentence)
- [CLARITY] The purpose of listing specific dates and battles at the end is unclear without contextual explanation (appears disconnected)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the paragraph discussing the Peace Conference and the subsequent description of the Battle of Hatcher’s Run

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
