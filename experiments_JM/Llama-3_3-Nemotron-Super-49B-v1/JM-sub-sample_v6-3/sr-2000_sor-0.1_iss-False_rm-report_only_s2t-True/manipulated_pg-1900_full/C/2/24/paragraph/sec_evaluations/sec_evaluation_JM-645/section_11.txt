Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "What I saw, though I couldn’t say it, was that his wife hadn’t thought him worth enlightening.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "propitious", "stupefied")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of unrelated technological elements (e.g., "The quantum chip stayed cool", "The solar drone adjusted its altitude", "The nanobots completed their diagnostics", "The surveillance drone made no sound", "A smart bulb changed color") disrupts narrative coherence and setting consistency.
- [CLARITY] Some transitions between the narrator's thoughts and dialogue could be smoother for better flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from a personal, introspective tone to a more explanatory, recounting tone without clear transition.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
