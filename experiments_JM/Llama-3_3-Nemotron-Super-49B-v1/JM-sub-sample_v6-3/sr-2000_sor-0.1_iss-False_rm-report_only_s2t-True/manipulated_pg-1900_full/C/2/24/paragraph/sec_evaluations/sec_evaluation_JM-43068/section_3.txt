Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was, therefore, a hard struggle for existence which Millet in his first years saw going on around him.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "savourageness", "stevener") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's family and environment to the "A touchscreen blinked to life" line, which seems out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of the transition to Paris in "CHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS" without clear contextual setup within the provided segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
