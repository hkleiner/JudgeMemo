Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasnâ€™t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for all audiences (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Chapter I and Chapter II without clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the protagonist's motivations for wanting Vereker to read the review

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
