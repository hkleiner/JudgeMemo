        • Long, unbroken sentences (e.g., the description of the Bishop Museum) could benefit from division for easier reading
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of somewhat archaic language (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld", "requisite") may slightly impede modern readers' fluency
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from describing the ship's departure to discussing tourist attractions in Honolulu without clear connection

    - [LOGIC]:
        • The narrative jumps abruptly from a descriptive, observational tone to a more personal, reflective tone without clear connection.
