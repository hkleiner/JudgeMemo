  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "epigoni") might require additional effort for general readers.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Transitions between historical periods and ideas could be more explicitly guided for smoother flow.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical events (e.g., the impact of the French Revolution) might leave some readers disconnected.
