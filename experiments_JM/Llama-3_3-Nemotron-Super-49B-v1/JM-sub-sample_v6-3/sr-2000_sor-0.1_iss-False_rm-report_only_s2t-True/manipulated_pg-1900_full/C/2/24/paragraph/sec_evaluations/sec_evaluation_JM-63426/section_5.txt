Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I had worked in Ishpeming and Chicago so as to earn money to take me back to Boston...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or specialized terms (e.g., "deckle-edge papers", "typefounders") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between historical context, personal anecdote, and industry trends without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of the printing industry and historical figures (e.g., William Morris, Aubrey Beardsley) without brief introductions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
