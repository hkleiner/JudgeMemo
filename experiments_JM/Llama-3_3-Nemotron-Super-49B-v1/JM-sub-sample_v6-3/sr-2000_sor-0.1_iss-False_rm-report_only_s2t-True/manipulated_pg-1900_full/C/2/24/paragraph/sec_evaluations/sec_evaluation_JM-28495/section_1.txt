Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "demi-cry", "bonhomie") might require additional mental processing for contemporary readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase discussions, and the pursuit in London, which, while mostly coherent, might slightly disorient some readers due to its episodic nature.
- [CLARITY] The transition from discussing dog breeds to being on the tram could be slightly more seamless for enhanced flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
