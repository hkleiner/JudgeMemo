Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some passages (e.g., "She heard the murmuring words of good omen uttered as she was helped from her cramped seat and out onto a second strip of red carpet that led to the part of the compound that was to be hers.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "golden lily" glide, "searing iron across her consciousness")
- [ANACHRONISM] Introduction of a "camera drone" disrupts the historical setting's consistency

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the wedding festivities to the moonlit courtyard scene without clear temporal or thematic bridge
- [LOGIC] The narrative's pacing feels rushed in the final departure scene compared to the detailed wedding description
- [CLARITY] Kuei Ping's motivations for leaving could be more explicitly stated for clearer character insight

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
