Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pernicious habit", "cataract of ink") might require additional interpretation time for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between various topics (literature, social class fusion, industrial impacts) without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about shared knowledge (e.g., specific authors' styles, historical events like the Boer War) are made without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
