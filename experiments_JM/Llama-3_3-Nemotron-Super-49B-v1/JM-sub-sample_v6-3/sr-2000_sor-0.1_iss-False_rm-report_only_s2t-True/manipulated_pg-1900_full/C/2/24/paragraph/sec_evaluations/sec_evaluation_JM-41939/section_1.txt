Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "irksome task", "bespattered") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Rosa's childhood activities to the detailed account of her family's moves and challenges.
- [CLARITY] The sudden introduction of the "teleport pad" line disrupts the historical narrative's coherence and seems out of place.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
