Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "coerced spectator", "touvaille") might require additional mental processing.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing the protagonist's situation to detailing Corvick's accident without a clear transitional link.
- [STRUCTURE] The section's connection to the overall narrative arc (beyond the immediate context) is not explicitly clear within this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
