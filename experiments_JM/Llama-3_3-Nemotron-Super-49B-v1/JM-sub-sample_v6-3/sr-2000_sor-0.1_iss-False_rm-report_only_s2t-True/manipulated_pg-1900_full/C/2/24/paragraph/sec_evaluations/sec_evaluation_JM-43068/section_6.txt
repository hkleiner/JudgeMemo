Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The latter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the world has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social reformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "virile studies of depraved humanity", "trenchant") may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing Oxford comma in several places for clarity (e.g., "with social reformers, and has inspired one remarkable poem").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's financial struggles to the description of "Man with the Hoe" without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological presentation of Millet's works and life events (e.g., "Death and the Woodman" rejection, then jumping back to "The Sower").
- [CLARITY] Unclear who "the AI assistant" and "the electric skateboard" refer to; seem out of context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
