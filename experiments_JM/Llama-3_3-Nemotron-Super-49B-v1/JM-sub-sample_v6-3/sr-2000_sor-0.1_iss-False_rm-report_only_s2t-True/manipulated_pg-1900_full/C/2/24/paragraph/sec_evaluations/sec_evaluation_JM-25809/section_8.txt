Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in "A GPS signal recalibrated." (lacks contextual flow)
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("tur'ble", "g'nigh") may disrupt fluency for some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing quotation marks in some dialogue transitions (e.g., after "More'n a mile long--")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected shift to "The quantum chip stayed cool." (no clear relation to context)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt move from the deer incident to the conversation about Ches' father without a smooth link
- [LOGIC] Unclear why "A good incident is an opal among gems..." is immediately followed by a description of their return without a clearer connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
