Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The electric car rolled to a quiet stop." (seems out of context)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may impede smooth reading for some audiences (e.g., "desirous of having the members feel")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the cost of school supplies had been cut nearly in half as compared with that of the previous year" could be more concise

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing teacher meetings to the chapter on meeting with the school board
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the report to the board could be clearer in its introduction
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between some paragraphs, disrupting flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
