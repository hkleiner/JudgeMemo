Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "coram populo", "bunker" in this context) might require additional mental processing for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from Excalibur's adventures to the curate and Eileen's serious conversation feels somewhat disconnected without clearer transitional context.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Excalibur's perspective and the humans' dialogue without a seamless bridge, potentially jarring some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
