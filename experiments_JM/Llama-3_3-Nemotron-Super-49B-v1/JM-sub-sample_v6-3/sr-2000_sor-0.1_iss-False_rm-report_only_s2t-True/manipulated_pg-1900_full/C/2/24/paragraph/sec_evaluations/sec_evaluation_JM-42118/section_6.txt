Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Nay, did he not even admit it in his constantly affirmed, if cynical, creed...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee", "wert", "dost")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional comma splices and run-on sentences (e.g., "...he repeated her cynical saying of 'Après nous le déluge.' It was to be a deluge indeed--scarlet red.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from discussing Fragonard's career to the detailed historical and political context of France (e.g., transition to Du Barry and Louis of France)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence, making the connection between ideas less transparent
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from "The teleport pad dimmed after use." to the following paragraph)
