Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "With cold hands and eyes blinded by tears she put the bar back in place.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or culturally specific terms (e.g., "mandarin robe", "tiger caps") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression (e.g., jumping from Kuei Ping's emotional state to the introduction of Chang An) can slightly disrupt flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumed cultural and historical context (e.g., the significance of bearing a son, the role of the Goddess of One Hundred Children) may leave some readers unclear without prior knowledge.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
