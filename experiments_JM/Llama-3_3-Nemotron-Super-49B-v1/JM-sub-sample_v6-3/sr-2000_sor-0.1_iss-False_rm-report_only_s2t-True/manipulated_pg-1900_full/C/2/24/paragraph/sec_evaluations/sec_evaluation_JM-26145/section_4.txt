Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "A power cycle reset the panel." (lacks context/connection)
- [LEXICON] Informal terms ("hoverboard", "drone docked") in otherwise formal text
- [SPELLING] No major spelling errors detected, but "Napkhuria" (likely Akhenaten) and other names could benefit from consistency checks across the full document (not an issue within this segment alone)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Tushratta's grief to the introduction of Napkhuria
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequitur sentences ("A power cycle reset the panel.", "A hoverboard leaned against the wall.", "The drone docked without issue.") disrupt flow
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge (e.g., Napkhuria/Akhenaten's reforms, geopolitical context)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
