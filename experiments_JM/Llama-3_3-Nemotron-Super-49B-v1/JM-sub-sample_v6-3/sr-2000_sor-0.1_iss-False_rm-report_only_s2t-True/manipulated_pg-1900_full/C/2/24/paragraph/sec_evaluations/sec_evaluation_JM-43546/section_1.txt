Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Minor sentence structure repetition (e.g., multiple simple sentences in a row)
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly formal vocabulary for a children's narrative (e.g., "whiled away", "neighbourhood")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing the puppy's meal to detailing Scottish tea foods without a clear connector
- [STRUCTURE] Subplot introduction (Uncle Alan's visit) feels somewhat tangential to the main puppy storyline

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
