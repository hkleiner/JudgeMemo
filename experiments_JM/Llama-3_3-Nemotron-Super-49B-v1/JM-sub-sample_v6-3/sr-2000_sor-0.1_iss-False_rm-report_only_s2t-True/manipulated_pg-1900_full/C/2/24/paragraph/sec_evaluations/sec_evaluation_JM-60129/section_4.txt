Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "Ene", "Yögur", "Rtangu rgonba") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive travelogue, cultural observation, and geographical detail without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of locations and tribes (e.g., "Shera Yögurs", "Yellow Tanguts") might confuse readers without the context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
