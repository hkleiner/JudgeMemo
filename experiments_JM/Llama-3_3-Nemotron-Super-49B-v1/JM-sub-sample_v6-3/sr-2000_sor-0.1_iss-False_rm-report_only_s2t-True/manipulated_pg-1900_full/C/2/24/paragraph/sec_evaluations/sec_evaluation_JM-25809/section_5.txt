Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Jim thought quick and hard, with chills and fever coursing over him ad libitum."
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("dat", "yer", "ginnies") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of ellipses ("...") for dramatic effect, potentially slowing pace

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from emotional reflection to snake encounter feels abrupt
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between Ches' song and Jim's reaction besides stated irritation
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jump from camp to trail without clear time transition

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
