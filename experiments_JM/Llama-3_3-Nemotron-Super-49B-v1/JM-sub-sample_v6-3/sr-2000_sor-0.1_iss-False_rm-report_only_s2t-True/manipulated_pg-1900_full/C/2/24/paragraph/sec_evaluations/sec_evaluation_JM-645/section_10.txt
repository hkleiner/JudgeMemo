Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "It wasn’t however, I hasten to add, that my case, in spite of this invidious comparison, wasn’t ambiguous enough.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "renannouncement", "invidious", "aflame")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrative focus from Vereker's health to the narrator's obsession without clear transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression can be slightly disorienting without prior context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
