Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence, and she was bound out to Mrs. Lane like a slave; she, proud, free Debby Mason!")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("lass", "thou", "thee") might reduce readability for modern readers without historical context familiarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life under Mrs. Lane's care (could benefit from a clearer narrative bridge)
- [CLARITY] The sudden mention of "the motion sensor" is jarring and seems out of context or possibly a typo/error

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
