1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long, nested sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "guerdon", "sultry spot") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from descriptive narrative to philosophical questioning without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the village's and characters' prior actions/context without explicit explanation.
