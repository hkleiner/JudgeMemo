Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "Darn her hide, she was beautiful! What did she expect? Looking at her, how could a man concentrate....")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common expressions ("Gmph!", "uni-sexual") might affect readability for modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (though not severely impacting understanding)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in Margot's behavior (locking them in) feels somewhat unexplained within this segment
- [STRUCTURE] The letter's introduction feels somewhat abrupt without prior hint at its significance
- [CLARITY] A few character motivations (e.g., Ramsey's immediate trust issues with Margot, then kissing her) could be more clearly established

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
