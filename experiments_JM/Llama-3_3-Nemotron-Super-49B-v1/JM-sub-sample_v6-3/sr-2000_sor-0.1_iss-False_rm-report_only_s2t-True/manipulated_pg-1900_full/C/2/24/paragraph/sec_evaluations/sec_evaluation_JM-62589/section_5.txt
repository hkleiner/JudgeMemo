Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "The virtual pet blinked twice.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "wan smile", "ghastly face")
- [PUNCTUATION] Potential for improved clarity with additional or differently placed punctuation in emotionally intense dialogue

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in Robert's ability to mimic Morley without prior indication of this skill
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the emotional scene with Mason's death to the practical conversation with the British riders
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the immediate context of Mason's final conversations due to the lack of explicit setup for some references (e.g., "something I wanted to tell her")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
