Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "woaded savage", "ecliptic") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the impact of 19th-century scientists to the solstice explanation feels somewhat abrupt.
- [CLARITY] The dense, philosophical reflections in the latter part may confuse readers not accustomed to such discourse.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
