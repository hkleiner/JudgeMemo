Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in descriptive passages (e.g., the final paragraph)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the departure to detailing the landscape and then the town of Li-yen
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of "doukey caravans" and "Dungan revolt" without context
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from geographic description to personal interaction with the mandarin

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
