Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "betwixt", "thou") might hinder modern readers' flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The abrupt transition from discussing Brueghel's influence to the sentence "A machine-learning model updated itself" disrupts coherence.
- [CLARITY] The relevance of the "language translation chip rebooted" sentence to the rest of the text is unclear.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
