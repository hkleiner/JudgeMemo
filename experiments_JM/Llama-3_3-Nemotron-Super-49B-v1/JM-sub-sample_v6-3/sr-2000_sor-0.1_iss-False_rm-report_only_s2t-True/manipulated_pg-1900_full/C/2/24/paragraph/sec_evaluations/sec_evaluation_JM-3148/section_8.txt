Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "A data stream flowed uninterrupted." and the subsequent dialogue (lacks contextual connection)
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent tone in "A touchscreen blinked to life." (jarring modern reference in otherwise vintage context)
- [SYNTAX] Sudden, unexplained shift in narrative perspective in "The surveillance drone made no sound." (disrupts flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Introduction of unrelated elements ("A data stream...", "surveillance drone", "touchscreen") without explanation or integration
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequitur opening sentence disrupts the expected continuation from the context segment
- [CLARITY] Overly poetic descriptions occasionally obscure the progression of the plot (e.g., the detailed sensory experiences)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
