Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "aromacular", "quasi-biological", "sinewy suppleness") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical explanation, and academic critique without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with Spencer's works and 19th-century scientific context can obscure comprehension.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
