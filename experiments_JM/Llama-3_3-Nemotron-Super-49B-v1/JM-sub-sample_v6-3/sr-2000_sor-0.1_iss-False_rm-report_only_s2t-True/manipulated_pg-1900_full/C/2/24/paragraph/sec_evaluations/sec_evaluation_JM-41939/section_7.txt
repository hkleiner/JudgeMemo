Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "the concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity")
- [LEXICON] Formal vocabulary might reduce accessibility for non-native or younger readers (e.g., "prostrated", "dissenting note", "panegyric")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the artist's work to her death and funeral (could benefit from a clearer link)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the Salon" and its significance without brief contextualization within this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
