Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition at "A 3D printer started humming." (disrupts historical context)
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic terms ("3D printer", "smart glasses") in historical narrative
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (should be "Crécy")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of modern elements (3D printer, smart glasses) without clear relevance or transition
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from descriptive to comparative analysis without smooth connection
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of specific historical figures/events without brief context for all readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
