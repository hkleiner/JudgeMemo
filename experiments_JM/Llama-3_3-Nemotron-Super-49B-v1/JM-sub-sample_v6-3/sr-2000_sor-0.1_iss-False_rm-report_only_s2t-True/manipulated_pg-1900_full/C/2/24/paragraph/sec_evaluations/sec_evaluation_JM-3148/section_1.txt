Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "liebling", "degraded") might require additional context or lookup for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the descriptive, poetic segment to Anthony Croft's backstory without a clear connecting device.
- [CLARITY] The narrative's shift in focus (from Davy and Tony's interaction to Tony's past) could be smoother for enhanced coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
