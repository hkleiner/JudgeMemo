Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in transitions (e.g., "A smart bulb changed color.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-specialists (e.g., "eugenists", "biologists", and "statesmen" in a religious context)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing the Old Testament to "A smart bulb changed color" without clear connection

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of "A smart bulb changed color" seems unrelated to the surrounding discussion, disrupting coherence
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential jump in topics (e.g., from Old Testament ideals to a modern, unrelated object)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of specific religious texts and figures without introduction may confuse some readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
