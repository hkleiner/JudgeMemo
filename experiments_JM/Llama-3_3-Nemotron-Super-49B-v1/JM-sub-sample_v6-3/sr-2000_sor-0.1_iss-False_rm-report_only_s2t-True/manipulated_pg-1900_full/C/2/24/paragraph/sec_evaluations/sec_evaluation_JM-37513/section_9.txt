Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Occasional unclear subject-verb agreement in long sentences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Spencer's theory to introducing the concept of "gravitative knowledge" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or transitions between distinct ideas (e.g., shift from critique of parallelism to discussion of cognitive relatedness)
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., "the locus of awareness") not fully elaborated for clarity
