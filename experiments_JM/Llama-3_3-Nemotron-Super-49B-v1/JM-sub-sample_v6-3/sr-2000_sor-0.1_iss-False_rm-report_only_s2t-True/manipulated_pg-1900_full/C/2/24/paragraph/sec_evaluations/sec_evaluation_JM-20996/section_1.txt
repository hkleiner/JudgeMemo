Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It was on this day that the United States Government sent from San Francisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to establish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public schools." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic language (e.g., "wonted devotion", "beheld", "requisite") may slightly impede modern readers' fluency
- [SYNTAX] Long, unbroken sentences (e.g., the description of the Bishop Museum) could benefit from division for easier reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing the ship's departure to discussing tourist attractions in Honolulu without clear connection
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of unrelated, detailed anecdotes (e.g., Napoleon's experience) disrupts the narrative's focus
- [STRUCTURE] Chapter I ends abruptly without summarizing the significance of the day or transitioning smoothly into Chapter II

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
