Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple places (e.g., "I had at first found a way to persuade myself...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "maturer grace", "incontestably handsome", "trepidation")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from emotional interaction to literary critique without clear transition (e.g., moving from the confrontation with Mrs. Corvick to analyzing "Overmastered")
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow can be slightly disorienting due to time jumps and reflections

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
