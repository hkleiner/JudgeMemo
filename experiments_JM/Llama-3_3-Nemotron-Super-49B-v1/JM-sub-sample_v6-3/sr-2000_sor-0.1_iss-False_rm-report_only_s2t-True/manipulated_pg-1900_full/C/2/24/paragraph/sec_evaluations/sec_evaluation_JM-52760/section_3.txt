Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some domain-specific terminology (e.g., military terms, historical names) might challenge non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive narrative and analytical reflection without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed prior knowledge of the broader historical context (e.g., the significance of Petersburg, key figures' roles) could confuse new readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
