Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., "You may read out-of-doors...") 
- [LEXICON] Informal tone inconsistencies (e.g., "digital display counted down silently" feels out of context and tone)
- [SPELLING] None detected
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "which seems a funny thing to have for breakfast" (could imply subject-verb agreement issue in some interpretations, though colloquial)
- [PUNCTUATION] None detected

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from breakfast description to "A digital display counted down silently" (lacks connection)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., "Hogmanay" without explanation for non-Scotch readers)
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Uncle Clarke's news to breakfast details without clear linking

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
