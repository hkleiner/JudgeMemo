Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "For during the time which lay between his leaving Boston and now as he sat beside the Delaware river in New Jersey, Shirtliffe had not seen, or heard of Morley."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may impede smooth reading for some audiences (e.g., "thou hast called thy beloved Son")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had expired" to "had pledged")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "A digital display counted down silently" disrupts historical context without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Robert's solitude to Washington's prayer without clear spatial/temporal cue
- [CLARITY] Robert's immediate recognition of Washington without prior close encounter feels unexplained

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
