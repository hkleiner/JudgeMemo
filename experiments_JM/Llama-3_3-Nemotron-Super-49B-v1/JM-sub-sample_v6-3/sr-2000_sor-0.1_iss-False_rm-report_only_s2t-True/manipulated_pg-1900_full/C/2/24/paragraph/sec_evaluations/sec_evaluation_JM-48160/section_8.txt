Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between the newsboys description and the shift to Major C.'s story.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "dissimilarity", "remonstrance") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Unmarked, abrupt shift from narrative to informational/text-like content (e.g., the document read aloud, the description of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of the document's content without clear narrative lead-in.
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative flow due to rapid context switches (newsboys, Major C.'s story, the document, "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" description).
- [CLARITY] The narrator's personal goal ("to write about the work of its women in the war") feels tacked on and unclear in its relevance to the preceding narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
