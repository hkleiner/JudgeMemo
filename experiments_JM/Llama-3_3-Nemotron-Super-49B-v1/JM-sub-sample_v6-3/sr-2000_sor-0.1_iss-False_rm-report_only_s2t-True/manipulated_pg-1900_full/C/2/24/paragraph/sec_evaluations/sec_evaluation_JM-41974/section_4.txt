Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "If historic exactitude is the one thing that counts in a painting, then this picture simply does not exist.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "disinterestedness", "incongruities") might require a brief pause for less advanced readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the painting's beauty to introducing the Inquisition trial (could benefit from a smoother link)
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptive analysis, historical context, and biographical events without clear sectioning or transitional phrases within the provided segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
