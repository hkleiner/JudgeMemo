Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, affecting flow (e.g., "He must protect himself and report to Washington if it were possible. He was young, and with all the misery life was sweet.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional word choice feels slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "groping hands", "slim hands over the still breast"), which might slightly impede smooth reading for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift from Robert's desperate situation to his immediate concern for Morley's messages feels somewhat abrupt without clearer emotional transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter ends somewhat abruptly with Robert's rescue, lacking a more satisfying conclusion to his immediate storyline within this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
