- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "frizzed out", "gallant") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Fragonard's personal life to discussing the broader artistic and historical context without clear connectors.
- [STRUCTURE] The section blends biography, historical event narration, and art critique somewhat disjointedly.
