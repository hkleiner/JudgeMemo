Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He was not going to put his beloved mistress to shame by admitting to her relatives that he had not the faintest idea what she was talking about.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering", "lathy", "gaunt man") might require additional processing for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the detailed London scene to "CHAPTER: VII" without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The narrative leap from Excalibur's pursuit to the coroner's jury scene lacks contextual setup, potentially confusing readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
