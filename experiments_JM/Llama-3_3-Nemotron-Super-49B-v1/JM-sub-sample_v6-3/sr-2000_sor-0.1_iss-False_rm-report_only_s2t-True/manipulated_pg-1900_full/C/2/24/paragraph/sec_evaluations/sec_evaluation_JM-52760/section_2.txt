Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "entreaties", "assaulting forces") might slightly hinder readability for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Petersburg's importance to the start of the Battle of Petersburg without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sudden appearance of "the air purifier whirred quietly" is jarring and unrelated to the context, disrupting coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
