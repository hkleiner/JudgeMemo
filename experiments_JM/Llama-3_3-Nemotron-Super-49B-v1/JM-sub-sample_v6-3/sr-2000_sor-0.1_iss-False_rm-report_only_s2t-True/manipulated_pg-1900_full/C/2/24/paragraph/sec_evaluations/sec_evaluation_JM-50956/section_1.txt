Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "seas of blood and tears", "pitiful condition") might reduce readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russia's sacrifices alone prevented German victory without fully addressing counterfactuals or alternative scenarios.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Russia's role to the question "Could Germany have won the war?" without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
