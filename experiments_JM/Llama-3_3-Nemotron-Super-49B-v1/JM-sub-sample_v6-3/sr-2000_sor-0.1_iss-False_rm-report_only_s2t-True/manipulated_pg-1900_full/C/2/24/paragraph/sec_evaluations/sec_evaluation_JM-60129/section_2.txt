Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "potatow-noses" (likely typo for "potato-noses" or more accurately "potato-shaped noses")
- [LEXICON] "tomashá" (unclear without context, assuming it's a proper term, but could benefit from brief explanation for clarity)
- [SYNTAX] "The drone’s camera swiveled silently." (abrupt, unrelated sentence; disrupts flow)
- [SPELLING] "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch." (completely out of context, disrupts historical consistency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between descriptive sections (e.g., from house description to economic conditions without clear linking)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., "tomashá", "Khirgis", and "Mongolians" styles without brief explanation)
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of anachronistic elements (smartwatch, drone) without explanation or context
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connections between paragraphs (e.g., from clothing to livestock management)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
