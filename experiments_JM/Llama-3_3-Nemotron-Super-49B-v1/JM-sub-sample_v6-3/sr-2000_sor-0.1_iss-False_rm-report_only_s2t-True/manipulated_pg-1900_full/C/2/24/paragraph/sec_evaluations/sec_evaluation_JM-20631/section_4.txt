Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "If there were only a single God, and He a God of justice and the world, how could He be confined to Israel? The Mission could not but come.")
- [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "centripetal and centrifugal forces", "dynast of endlessness")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few instances (e.g., "Moses goes on to remind Him... He repented")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that critics of the Jewish God's tribalism are unaware of universalist passages without direct evidence.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing biblical examples to quoting non-biblical sources (e.g., transition to quoting Dion Cassius)
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with multiple, loosely connected ideas.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
