Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was this noble ambition...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "quasar chip" seems out of context, likely an error for "quantum chip" or similar, but assuming "quantum chip" is correct, it's a jarring anachronism).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to his birth and early life without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote's connection to the rest of the introduction could be more explicitly stated for immediate clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
