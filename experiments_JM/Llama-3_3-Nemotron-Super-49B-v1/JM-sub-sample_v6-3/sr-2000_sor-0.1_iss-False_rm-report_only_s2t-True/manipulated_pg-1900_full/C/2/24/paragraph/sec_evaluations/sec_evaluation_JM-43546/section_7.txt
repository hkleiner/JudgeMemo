Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "tewky", "ben room", "but room") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between narrative, descriptive, and explanatory passages without strong transitional links.
- [CLARITY] Sandy's parcel mystery, while engaging, feels somewhat disconnected from the broader narrative flow until its reveal.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
