Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the last paragraph of the first visit to the leper colony)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "indissoluble enigma", "visayan tongue") without clear necessity for the context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in transition between paragraphs, though not severely disruptive)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the leper colony visit to the "Hike" chapter without a clear connecting theme or bridge
- [CLARITY] The narrative assumes prior knowledge of locations (e.g., Jimamaylan, the islands) without brief contextual reminders for potentially unfamiliar readers
- [LOGIC] The pursuit of ladrones feels somewhat tangential to the overall narrative flow, lacking a strong narrative payoff or connection to preceding events

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
