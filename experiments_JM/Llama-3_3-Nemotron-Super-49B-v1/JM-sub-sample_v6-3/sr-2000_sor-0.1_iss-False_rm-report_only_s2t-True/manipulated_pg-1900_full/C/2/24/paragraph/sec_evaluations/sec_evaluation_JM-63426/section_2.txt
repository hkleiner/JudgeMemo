Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "heated (?)" - Unclear notation, disrupts flow
- [SYNTAX] "A digital display counted down silently." - Abrupt, unrelated sentence
- [LEXICON] Overly formal/vintage vocabulary may hinder modern readability (e.g., "atelier", "unbleached cotton-cloth")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between leaving Rand McNally and returning (needs clearer time indicator)
- [LOGIC] Assumption that designers don't engrave is a pivotal moment but feels slightly rushed
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Chicago to returning to Michigan without clear narrative bridge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
