Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "simmering cauldron") might slow comprehension for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps abruptly from the murder scene to the aftermath and canonization process without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The motivations behind Roger's actions and the monastery's desire for a relic could be more explicitly stated for clarity.
