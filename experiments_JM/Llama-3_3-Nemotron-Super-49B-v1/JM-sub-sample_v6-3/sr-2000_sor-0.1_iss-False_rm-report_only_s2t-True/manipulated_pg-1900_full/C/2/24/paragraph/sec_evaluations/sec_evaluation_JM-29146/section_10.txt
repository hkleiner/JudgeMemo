Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "And yet, with the conviction that only a mystic can have--although he certainly was no mystic--Ramsey knew the galaxy would be in grave trouble if mankind were given the secret of matter-transmission."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in "mystic experience always is like that" (could be simplified for clarity)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Ramsey led Margot back to Enterprise" (should be "the Enterprise")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained transformation of Garr Symm without clear setup or explanation within the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Vardin's explanation to the conclusion with "The gleaming walls were gone. The black box was gone. Vardin was gone." without a smoother transition.
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in Vardin's role and capabilities (e.g., "I am a guardian") without sufficient context within the segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
