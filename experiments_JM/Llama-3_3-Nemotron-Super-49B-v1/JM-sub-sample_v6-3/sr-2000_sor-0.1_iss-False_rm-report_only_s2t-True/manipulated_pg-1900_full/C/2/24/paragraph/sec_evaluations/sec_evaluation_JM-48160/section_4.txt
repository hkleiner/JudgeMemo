Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is not my purpose to describe the hospitals here...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance vividness for modern readers (e.g., "unmistakably a hospital and nothing else" feels slightly vague).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing hospitals to the drive within the city limits (lacks a clear connecting sentence).
- [CLARITY] The phrase "A livestream began recording" is unclear and disrupts the narrative's temporal flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
