Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and Fragonard's personal story (e.g., "A camera drone circled overhead.")
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic term ("camera drone") disrupts historical context
- [SPELLING] None detected
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the glories of the Revolution alarmed the old man" (could imply the glories, not the terrors, alarmed him, though context clarifies)
- [SYNTAX] Complex, long sentences may impede flow for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in focus (e.g., from the Reign of Terror to Fragonard's departure without clear transitional link)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., mentioning the Du Barry's death, then Fragonard's departure "shortly after")
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events without introduction (e.g., "the Malvilan")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between Fragonard's story and broader historical events (e.g., the end of the Terror, Napoleon's rise)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
