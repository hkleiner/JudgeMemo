Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several passages (e.g., the lengthy, winding sentence starting with "Because of the mischief...").
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee", "lang", "puir").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (not explicitly found but potential given the text's age and style).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from literary analysis to the bookman's habits and desires (lacks a clear connecting thread).
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are dense with references, potentially confusing without prior knowledge of all cited works/authors.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of explicit links between the evaluation of heroines and the subsequent bookman narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
