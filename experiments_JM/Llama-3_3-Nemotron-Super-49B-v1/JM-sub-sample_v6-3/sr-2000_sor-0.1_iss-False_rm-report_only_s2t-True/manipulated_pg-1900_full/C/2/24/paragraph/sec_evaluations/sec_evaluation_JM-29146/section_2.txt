Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent but incorrect representation of drunken speech, may distract some readers)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of descriptive phrases for alien species (e.g., "blue-skinned and fantastically wasp-waisted", "fish-eyed, scale-skinned") which, while vivid, occasionally slow the pace.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of Garr Symm's importance without prior context in the provided segment (understandable given the excerpt nature, but still somewhat jarring)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the emotional goodbye at the Englanders' to the gambling scene (could benefit from a smoother connection)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
