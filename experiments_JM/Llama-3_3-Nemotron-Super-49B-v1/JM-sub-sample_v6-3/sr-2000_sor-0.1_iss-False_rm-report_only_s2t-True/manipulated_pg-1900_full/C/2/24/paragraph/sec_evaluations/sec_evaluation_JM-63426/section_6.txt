Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "However, after a momentâ€™s brief consideration...") 
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "humming", "lay-outs", "supervision") that might slightly impede smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Wayside Press's growth to the "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" chapter without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, potentially confusing the reader (e.g., the description of the young man's appearance and actions leading up to meeting Mr. Davis)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
