Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence transitions (e.g., "A smart bulb changed color." and "A silent alarm triggered.") disrupting flow.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialized audiences.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph discussing Spencer's omission of relational analysis).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are deeply familiar with Spencer's work without sufficient context.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential discussion of concepts (e.g., the sudden shift from "ground" concept to discussing the universe).
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., distinction between "Source," "ground," and "condition") without clear examples.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
