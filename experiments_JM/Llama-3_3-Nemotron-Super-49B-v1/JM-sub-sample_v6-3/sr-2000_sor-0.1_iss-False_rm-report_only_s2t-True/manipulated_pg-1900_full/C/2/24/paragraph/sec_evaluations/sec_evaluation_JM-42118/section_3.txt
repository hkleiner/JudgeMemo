Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ennobling" (should be "ennobling" is correct, but "ennobling" is the more common variant, however, this is not an error, thus no issue)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of elaborate vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "ardent brush", "dainty decorations")
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs may impede smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's artistic development to the detailed historical/political context of France (e.g., the shift to discussing Choiseul and the Pompadour)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures (e.g., Diderot, Grimm, Choiseul) and artistic movements without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of modern elements (VR headset, tablet) disrupts the historical narrative's coherence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
