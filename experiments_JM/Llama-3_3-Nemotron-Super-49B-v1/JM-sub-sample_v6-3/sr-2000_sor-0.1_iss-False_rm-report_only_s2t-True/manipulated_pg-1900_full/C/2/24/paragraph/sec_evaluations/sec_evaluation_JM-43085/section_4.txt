Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures in descriptive passages (e.g., Gautier's quotes) may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "prodigious anxiety", "fleeting") might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's response to critics to the sentence "A keyboard clicked without being touched" (appears unrelated).
- [CLARITY] The phrase "A smart door slid open smoothly" seems out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
