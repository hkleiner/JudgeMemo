Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "suzerainty", "auto-tuner") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing the plague to royal etiquette and then to the dispute over golden statuettes slightly disrupts the narrative flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different storylines (Assyrian relations, Alashia's prince, Tushratta's demands) without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
