Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "In virtue of its 'inheritance from the past', it would continue at uniform velocity in one direction.")
- [LEXICON] Use of overly technical or obscure vocabulary without clear explanation (e.g., "heredity-relatedness", "vital relationship")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., "We must just accept this as what appears to be a fact.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about awareness in non-human entities without clear justification (e.g., earth's "gravitative knowledge")
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing physiological processes and introducing the concept of awareness
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts not fully elaborated for clarity (e.g., distinction between "knowledge in the extended sense" and "proper and narrower sense")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
