Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "inexhaustible", "sombre", "patrimony").
- [LENGTH] Some sentences are excessively long, potentially disrupting flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing materialism's failure and introducing global integration without a clear link.
- [CLARITY] The quote about nanobots seems out of context and unclear in its relevance.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from criticizing materialism to discussing global integration could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
