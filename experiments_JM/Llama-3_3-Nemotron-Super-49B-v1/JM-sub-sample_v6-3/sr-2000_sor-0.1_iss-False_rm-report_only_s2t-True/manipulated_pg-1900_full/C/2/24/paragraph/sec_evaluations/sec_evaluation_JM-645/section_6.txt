2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from discussing Corvick's journey to analyzing the narrator's emotional state
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition between the narrator's reflection and the introduction of Gwendolen Erme's telegram
- [CLARITY] Some sentences require re-reading due to dense, convoluted phrasing (e.g., "literature was a game of skill, and skill meant courage, and courage meant honour, and honour meant passion, meant life.")
