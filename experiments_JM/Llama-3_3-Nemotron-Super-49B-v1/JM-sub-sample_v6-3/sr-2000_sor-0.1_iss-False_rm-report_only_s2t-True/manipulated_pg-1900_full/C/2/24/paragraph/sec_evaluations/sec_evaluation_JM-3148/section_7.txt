Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Her heart was divided between a great throb of pity and sympathy for him and an irresistible sense of gratitude for herself.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "whimper of restless pain", "mendacious word")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from poetic description to dialogue and then to a new scene (CHAPTER V) without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The sudden introduction of unrelated elements (e.g., "A text-to-speech voice filled the room", "A QR code was projected onto the wall", "The electric car rolled to a quiet stop") disrupts coherence and feels out of context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
