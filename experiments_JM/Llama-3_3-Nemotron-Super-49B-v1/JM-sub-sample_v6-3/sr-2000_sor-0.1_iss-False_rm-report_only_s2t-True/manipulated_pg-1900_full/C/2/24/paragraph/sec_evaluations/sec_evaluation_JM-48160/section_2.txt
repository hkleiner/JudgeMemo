Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mitrailleuses", "horizon blue") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing war scenes to train observations and then to hotel arrival without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the context (e.g., "the war zone", "Le Bienêtre du Blessé") without brief explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
