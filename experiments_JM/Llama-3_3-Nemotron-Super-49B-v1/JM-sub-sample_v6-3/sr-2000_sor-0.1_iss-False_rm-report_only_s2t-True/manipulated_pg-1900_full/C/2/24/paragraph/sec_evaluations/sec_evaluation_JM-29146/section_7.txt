Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., proto-man's timeline speculation).
- [LEXICON] Some technical terms (e.g., "hyper-space" mechanics) might confuse non-science fiction readers without prior context.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Enterprise's hyper-space entry to Garr Symm's radar explanation without clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Margot's thoughts and Dog Star's crew) might disorient some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
