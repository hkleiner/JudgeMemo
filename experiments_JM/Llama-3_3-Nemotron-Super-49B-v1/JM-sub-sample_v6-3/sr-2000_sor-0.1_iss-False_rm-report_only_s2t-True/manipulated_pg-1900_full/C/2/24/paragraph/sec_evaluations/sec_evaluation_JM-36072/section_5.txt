Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "scabrous", "muck-rake") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced literary works and historical events without explicit explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Tennyson's work to broader Victorian religious and social contexts without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
