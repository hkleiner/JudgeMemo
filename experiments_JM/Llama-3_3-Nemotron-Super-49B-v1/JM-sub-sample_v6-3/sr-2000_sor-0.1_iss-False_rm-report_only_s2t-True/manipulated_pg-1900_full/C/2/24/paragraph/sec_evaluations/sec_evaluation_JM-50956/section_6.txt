Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "A thermal sensor picked up movement." (seems out of context)
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "thus" for transitions
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "not less than 12,000,000" (could be more concise as "at least 12,000,000")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt inclusion of unrelated elements (e.g., "A text-to-speech voice filled the room.", "A drone swarm aligned in formation.")
- [STRUCTURE] Conclusions (labeled 1-6) feel somewhat disconnected from the preceding statistical analysis
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences in statistical explanations may confuse readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
