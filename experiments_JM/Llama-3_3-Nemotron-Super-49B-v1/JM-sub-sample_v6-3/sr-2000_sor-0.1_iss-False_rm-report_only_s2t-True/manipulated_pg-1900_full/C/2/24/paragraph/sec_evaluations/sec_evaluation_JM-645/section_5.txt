Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "Deep down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy, I was expectant.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "bedlamitical", "stupefied")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (not prominently disruptive)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnect between the narrator's expressed doubts and their continued engagement/investment
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Vereker's tip to the chess analogy (though effective, somewhat jarring)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with ideas, potentially making focus difficult

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
