Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "The result had been the capture of Petersburg and Richmond, but more important, it had led to the flight...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "relentless attrition") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the fall of Petersburg to the broader outcome of the war (e.g., the jump to "On the Sunday following...").
- [STRUCTURE] The section concludes with a broad summary of the war's end, which, while coherent, somewhat detaches from the immediate context of Petersburg's fall.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
