Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "reconciled to her existence", "eternal bliss", "spiritual harmony") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph describing the violin's sound) could improve with simpler punctuation for easier flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section abruptly shifts from criticizing Lyddy's housekeeping to describing her interior decorating and emotional state without a clear transitional link.
- [CLARITY] The narrative's switch between Aunt Hitty's observations and Lyddy's inner world, while effective, might benefit from clearer signaling to aid reader transition.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
