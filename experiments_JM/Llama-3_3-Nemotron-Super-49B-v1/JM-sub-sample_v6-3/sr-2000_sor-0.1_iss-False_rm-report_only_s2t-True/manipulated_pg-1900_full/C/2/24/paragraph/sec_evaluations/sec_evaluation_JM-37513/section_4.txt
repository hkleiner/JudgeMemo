Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "What, then, becomes of the scientific conception of energy?...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "whilst", "sanctioned by custom and long usage")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles or awkward phrasing (e.g., "It is imperative to remember that not only the rate of change but the kind of change differs...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Circular reasoning in the discussion of "energy" and "cause" (e.g., looping back to Spencer's conception without clear resolution)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing "force" to introducing "wearable device" (unrelated, disruptive)
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient concrete examples (e.g., "relatedness" and its implications)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
