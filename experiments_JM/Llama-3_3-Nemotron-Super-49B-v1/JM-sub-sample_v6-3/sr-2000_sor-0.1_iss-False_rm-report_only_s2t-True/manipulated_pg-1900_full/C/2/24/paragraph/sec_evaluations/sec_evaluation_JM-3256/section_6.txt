Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mendacious", "sleet of March", "vellumed") might challenge casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between the bookman's character, his justifications, and philosophical musings without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from the bookman's actions to the quote about "The Book is a sure friend" and later to the "Birmingham book-lover" feels somewhat disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
