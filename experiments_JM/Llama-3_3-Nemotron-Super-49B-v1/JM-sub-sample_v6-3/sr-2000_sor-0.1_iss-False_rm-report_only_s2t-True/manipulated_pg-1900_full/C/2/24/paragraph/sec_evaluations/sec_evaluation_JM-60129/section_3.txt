Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "potatow-noses" (likely "potato-noses" or more accurately "pug noses")
- [SYNTAX] "the modest supply of liquor seldom sufficed for all" (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "on the contrarys" (should be "on the contrary")
- [LEXICON] "sluggish" (contextually unclear if perfectly conveys the intended meaning)
- [SYNTAX] "A 3D printer started humming", "A face recognition scan completed", "A drone swarm aligned in formation" (abrupt, unexplained technological references)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained appearances of modern technology (3D printer, face recognition scan, drone swarm)
- [STRUCTURE] Statistics table feels disconnected from the preceding descriptive text without clear introduction
- [CLARITY] "It must be pointed out..." paragraph assumes prior context not fully provided in the segment
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from customs to the table of statistics without smooth transition

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
