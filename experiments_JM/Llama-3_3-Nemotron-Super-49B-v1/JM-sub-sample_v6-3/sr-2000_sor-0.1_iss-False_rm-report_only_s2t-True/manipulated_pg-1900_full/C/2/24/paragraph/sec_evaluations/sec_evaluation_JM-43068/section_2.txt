Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "to-morrow") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing Millet's artistic style to introducing "CHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between analyzing specific artworks, Millet's philosophical approach, and his biography, which, while related, could benefit from smoother transitions.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
