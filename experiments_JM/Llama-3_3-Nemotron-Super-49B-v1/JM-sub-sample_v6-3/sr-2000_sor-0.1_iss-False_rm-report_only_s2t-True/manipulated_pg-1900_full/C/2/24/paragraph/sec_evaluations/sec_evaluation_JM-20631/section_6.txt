Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic references (e.g., "Our Sion", "Delenda est Carthago") might require additional context for full understanding.
- [PUNCTUATION] Occasional lack of clarity in long, unpunctuated or lightly punctuated poetic quotes within prose.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between discussing historical events and poetic analyses (e.g., shifting from Cromwell to Marvell's lament).
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological presentation of ideas and historical events can confuse without prior knowledge.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures/events (e.g., Seeley, Thomson, Kipling's contexts) may hinder understanding for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
