Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If the models that passed in endless procession before his eyes impressed him as magnificent opportunities...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full comprehension (e.g., "enamoured", "disinterestedness").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between biographical narrative, artistic style description, and specific project details without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Veronese's works and historical context (e.g., "the Most Serene Republic") might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
