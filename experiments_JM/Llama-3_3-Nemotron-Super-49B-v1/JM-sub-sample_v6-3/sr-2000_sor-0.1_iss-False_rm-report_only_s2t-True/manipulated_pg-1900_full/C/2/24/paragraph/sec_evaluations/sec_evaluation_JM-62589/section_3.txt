Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The year of suppression and heartache rolled away. From the almost forgotten past came the words..." 
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some dialogue (e.g., "I vow Iâ€™ve a mind to give you no more lessons on the drum") may feel inconsistent with character traits.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "I listened at the door to hear it read when they thought I was feeding the cattle" could benefit from clearer temporal context).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "A camera lens refocused itself" and "The 3D printer finished the replica" without context or relevance to the narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's decision to join the army to the introduction of Chapter IV without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Debby's immediate decision to disguise as a boy) could be more explicitly developed for smoother understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
