Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The distance, by direct route, from where Robert had left the men, was probably not over seven or eight miles, but in the wood road, it was longer, and to the excited boy the miles seemed endless." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similar phrases for emotional states (e.g., "throbbing nerves", "sickening sensation", "frightened him") without sufficient variation
- [PUNCTUATION] Lack of clarity in dialogue attribution in some instances (e.g., "“Hello! Martin,” he whispered, “I’m all right. When did you get in?”") could benefit from clearer speaker identification

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's emotional state to the camp's joyful atmosphere without a clear transitional phrase
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter title "CHAPTER VI. - HOW MOLLY BORE THE NEWS." seems out of place within the evaluated segment, disrupting the narrative flow
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "The holographic map rotated slowly." (context or relevance unclear)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
