Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "futile", "inmost", "disillusioned") might require additional cognitive effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing the nature of selfishness and Christmas to the reaction post-Christmas feels somewhat disconnected without clearer thematic bridging.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter jumps between philosophical musings, a character's thoughts, and broader societal reflections without a clearly defined narrative or thematic progression.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
