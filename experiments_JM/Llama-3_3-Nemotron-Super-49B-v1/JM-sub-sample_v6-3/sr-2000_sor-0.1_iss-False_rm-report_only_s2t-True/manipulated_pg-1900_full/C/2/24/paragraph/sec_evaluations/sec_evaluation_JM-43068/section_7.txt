Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thorny", "quasi-classic", "inequality") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from biographical narrative to analytical art critique without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of referenced artworks and artists (e.g., "Breaking the Clod", "Man with the Hoe") without brief context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
