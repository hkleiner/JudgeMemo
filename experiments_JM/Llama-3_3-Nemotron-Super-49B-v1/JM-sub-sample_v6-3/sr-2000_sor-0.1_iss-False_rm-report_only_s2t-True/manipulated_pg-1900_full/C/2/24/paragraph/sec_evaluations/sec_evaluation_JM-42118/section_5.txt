Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "make-believe shepherds and shepherdesses of the vogue") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Du Barry to introducing the "MARRIAGE" chapter without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of mentioning "A surveillance camera moved slightly" is unclear and disrupts the narrative flow.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
