Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition at "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." (anachronistic and unrelated to the context)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some sections may hinder smooth reading for non-specialist audiences
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "he had met with two unfortunate accidents" could imply seeking out accidents, though context clarifies

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained introduction of "The voice-activated controls..." disrupts historical narrative coherence
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression in discussing Reynolds' life events and artistic philosophy
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events without brief context for potentially uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
