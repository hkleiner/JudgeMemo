Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "Recessional", "subordination of the individual to the communal weal") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Judaism's "purer truth" would be more universally appealing without clear justification.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Germanism vs. Judaism to introducing the concept of an "inner Jerusalem" without a clear connecting thought.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
