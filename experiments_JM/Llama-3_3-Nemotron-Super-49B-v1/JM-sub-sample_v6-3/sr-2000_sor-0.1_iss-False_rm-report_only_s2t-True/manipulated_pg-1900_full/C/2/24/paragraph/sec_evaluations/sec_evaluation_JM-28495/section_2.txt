Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "We had overrun our quarry. He had just emerged from some hiding place...")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading tastes (e.g., "quarry", "thou", "vermilion" not present but "venomous snap" and others)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (though generally well-managed)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from intense chase to domestic dialogue without clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The sudden introduction of "A backup drive clicked to life" and similar tech elements disrupts the otherwise consistent narrative voice and setting
- [LOGIC] The character's immediate decision to cut the string on the puppy without initial hesitation or questioning feels slightly rushed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
