Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of explanatory asides (e.g., defining "jiggot", "serviette", "tewky") disrupts narrative flow.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex (e.g., the paragraph discussing French influence on Scottish language).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different topics (e.g., from school to family dinner to historical context without clear connections).
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge (e.g., "Tales of a Grandfather" without introduction) may confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
