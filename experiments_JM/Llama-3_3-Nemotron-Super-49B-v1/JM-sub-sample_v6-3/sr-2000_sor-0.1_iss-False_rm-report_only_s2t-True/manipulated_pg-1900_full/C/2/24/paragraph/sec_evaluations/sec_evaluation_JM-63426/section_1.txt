Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms (e.g., "corn-fed American", "picklelime") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the end of "AN INTRODUCTION" and the start of "THE BOY PRINTER OF ISHPEMING" without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical art movements and figures (e.g., Morris, Beardsley) without brief explanation might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
