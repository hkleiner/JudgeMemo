Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The iron band being forged outside their city was a reality, and Grant, a tenacious man, had not loosened his grip."

- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., the entire paragraph starting with "The general plan of operations...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the Battle of Peeblesâ€™ Farm to the timeline entries (JULY 30, 1864, etc.)
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent narrative flow due to interspersed timeline entries without clear integration
- [CLARITY] Unclear purpose of including "A home pod switched tracks" and "A touchscreen panel showed static" without context
