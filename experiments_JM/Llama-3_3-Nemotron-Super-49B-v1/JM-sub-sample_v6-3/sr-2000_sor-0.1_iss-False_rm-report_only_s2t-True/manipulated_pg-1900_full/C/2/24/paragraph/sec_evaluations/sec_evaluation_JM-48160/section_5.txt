Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If I was forced to complain...").
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common terms (e.g., "taubes", "camions") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative of the trip and the reflective comment about being a "mascot".
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the war context and locations (e.g., "the war zone", "RÃ©vigny, Nancy and Remiramont") without brief elaboration.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
