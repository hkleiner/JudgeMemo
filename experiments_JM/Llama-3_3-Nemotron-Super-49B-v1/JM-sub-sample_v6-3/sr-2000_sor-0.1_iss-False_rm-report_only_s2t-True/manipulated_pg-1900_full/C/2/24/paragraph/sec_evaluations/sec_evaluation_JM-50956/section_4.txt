Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some passages.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "stupendous") might slightly hinder immediate understanding for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing 1915's events to quoting Ludendorf's memoirs without clear contextual setup.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different time periods (1915, 1916, 1917) without clear transitional phrases, potentially confusing the reader.
