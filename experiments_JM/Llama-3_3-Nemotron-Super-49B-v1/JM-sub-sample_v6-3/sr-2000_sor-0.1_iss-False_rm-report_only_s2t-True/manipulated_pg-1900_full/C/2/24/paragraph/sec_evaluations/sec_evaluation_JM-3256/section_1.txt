Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence "The energy grid remained balanced." disrupts flow.
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms (e.g., "fourpence-halfpenny") may hinder readability for some.
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., "As he was to preside...") challenge smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unrelated statement "A robotic hand adjusted the controls." jars coherence.
- [TRANSITION] Shift from personal anecdote to Colonial squatter story feels abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequitur transitions (e.g., from bookman definition to anecdote) slightly disrupt flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
