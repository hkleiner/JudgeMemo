Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for non-expert readers.
- [LEXICON] Utilization of highly specialized vocabulary (e.g., "interpenetrating whole of reality", "transfigured realism") could hinder comprehension for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift in topic with "The iPhone was fully charged now." and "The robotic arm sorted the tools." without clear contextual connection.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Potential circularity in discussing the unknowable as both beyond intellect and the foundation of all existence.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential introduction of unrelated elements (e.g., iPhone, robotic arm) disrupts the philosophical discourse flow.
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., distinction between "evolved" and "evolution") may confuse without additional contextual explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
