Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was this same spirit which impelled his fervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pyrotechnics", "temperament") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between Millet's personal development, artistic influences, and the broader art historical context without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of specific artists and art movements (e.g., Empire style, David's school) could reduce clarity for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
