Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] ("t'rough", "t'row", "youse" - inconsistent dialect representation may confuse some readers)
- [LEXICON] (Some archaic or less common terms like "lumbering", "street Arab" might require additional context for full understanding)
- [SYNTAX] (Occasional long, winding sentences, e.g., "His face changed rapidly..." to "...at dis stage of der game")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] (Abrupt transition from the emotional moment at the cabin to the detailed description of Jim's mining plans)
- [CLARITY] (The character "Gun" is introduced without clear context or explanation, potentially confusing readers)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
