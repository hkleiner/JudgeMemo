Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "Shirtliffeâ€™s" (inconsistent capitalization in some contexts, though consistent in others)
- [LEXICON] "ghastly wound" (somewhat archaic, may affect modern readability)
- [SYNTAX] "A GPS signal recalibrated." (abrupt, anachronistic, and unexplained, disrupting flow)
- [SYNTAX] "A smart bulb changed color." (similarly abrupt and unexplained)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Introduction of anachronistic elements (GPS, smart bulb) without explanation or integration
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene changes (e.g., from the hospital to Washington's presence) with little transition
- [CLARITY] Debby's backstory, while engaging, feels somewhat rushed and could benefit from more seamless integration

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
