Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "fax" (anachronistic term in historical context, should be "letter" or similar)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "For several months he did no work, or little work; and though...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Fragonard's artistic development to the historical event of Damiens stabbing the king (lacks contextual connection)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures and artistic terms without introduction (e.g., "the king's school of six élèves protégés")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
