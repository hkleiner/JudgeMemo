Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition at "A bluetooth signal was detected." (seems out of context)
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic terms ("A bluetooth signal", "autonomous vehicle") disrupt historical context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "We however..." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained mention of modern technology ("A bluetooth signal", "autonomous vehicle") disrupts historical narrative
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential jump from discussing 19th-century social issues to modern technology
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of specific literary and historical references without introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
