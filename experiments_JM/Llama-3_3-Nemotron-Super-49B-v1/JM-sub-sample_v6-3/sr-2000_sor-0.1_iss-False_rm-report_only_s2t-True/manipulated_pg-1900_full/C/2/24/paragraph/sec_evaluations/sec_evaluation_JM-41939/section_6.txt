Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "Under the effort of his tense muscles, the mane rises, bristling, around the powerful neck and above the straining head.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "undulous", "virility of execution") might require a second read for full comprehension by non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing art to introducing a new character (Miss Anna Klumpke) without a clear transitional phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., from painting to personal loss to new friendships) without clear sectioning or transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
