Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "For a month it had lain in its hiding place, having been brought forth once or twice at midnight, and donned in silence, that Debby might know the unholy joy of making believe she was a boy.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "gaby", "whither away so fast"), which might affect readability for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (e.g., "She had crossed the line now" feels somewhat out of sequence with the immediate past tense actions described).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in Debby's emotional state from "fun" to concern without clear transition ("Before her lay—she hardly knew what—but the thought chased the fun from her face.")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt scene change from Debby's room to the outdoor meeting with Jack Martin without a smooth connector.
- [CLARITY] The motivation behind Debby's immediate decision to disguise herself as a boy could be more clearly connected to the preceding events for better flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**
