Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "ride Life's lists as a knight might ride") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical narrative, artistic analysis, and philosophical musings without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 18th-century art and specific artists (e.g., Gainsborough, Romney) could hinder understanding for some.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
