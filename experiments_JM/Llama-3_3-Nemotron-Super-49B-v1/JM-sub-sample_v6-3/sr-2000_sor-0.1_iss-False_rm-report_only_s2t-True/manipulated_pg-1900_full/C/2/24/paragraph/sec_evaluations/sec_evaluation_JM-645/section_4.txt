Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I, on my side, saw likewise that one of the first things he would do would be to rush off with my story to Gwendolen.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "maddening month", "supersubtlety") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor disconnect between the intense pursuit of Vereker's secret and the sudden, somewhat casual, acceptance of failure ("I acted on Verekerâ€™s advice: I renounced my ridiculous attempt.")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the detailed narrative to the more reflective, analytical tone in the latter part of the segment ("The great point of it all is, however...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
