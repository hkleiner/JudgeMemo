Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "felicitous", "finality", "civilised") might require a second read for full comprehension by all audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing Reynolds' approach to painting different subjects (women, children, men) and the preservation/state of his work, which could be more smoothly connected.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Reynolds' contemporaries and specific artworks might leave some readers disconnected from the full context of comparisons.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
