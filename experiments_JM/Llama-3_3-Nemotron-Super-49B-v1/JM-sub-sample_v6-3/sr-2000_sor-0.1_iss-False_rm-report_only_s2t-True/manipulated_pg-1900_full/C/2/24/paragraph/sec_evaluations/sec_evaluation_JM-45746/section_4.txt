Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "I could give many illustrations of teachers who have 'found themselves' through being associated with student enterprises." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of transitional phrases ("In one of the towns...", "The second activity needed...") without sufficient variation
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "A wireless charger powered up." (appears out of context, lacking integration)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition after "A wireless charger powered up." (unrelated to surrounding context)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential placement of the quoted report from a Seattle high school principal (feels tacked on)
- [CLARITY] Overly vague statement "Much harm can come from poorly supervised student enterprises..." (lacks specific examples or explanation)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
