Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition at "The solar drone adjusted its altitude." (disrupts narrative flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "tree-calf", "tooled morocco") may hinder readability for non-specialists
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article before "public-house" in some instances (minor, but noticeable)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained introduction of "The solar drone..." and "Last week..." disrupts thematic coherence
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the historical/book collection discussion and the modern "bookman of the second generation" scenario
- [LOGIC] The analogy between dipsomania and bibliomania, while creative, feels somewhat forced and not fully developed in its implications

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
