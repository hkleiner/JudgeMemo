Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "inextinguishable urge", "animating principle") might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from philosophical discussion to the mention of a "smartwatch" disrupts the flow.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between explaining religious concepts and discussing the Bahá'í Faith's specifics without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
