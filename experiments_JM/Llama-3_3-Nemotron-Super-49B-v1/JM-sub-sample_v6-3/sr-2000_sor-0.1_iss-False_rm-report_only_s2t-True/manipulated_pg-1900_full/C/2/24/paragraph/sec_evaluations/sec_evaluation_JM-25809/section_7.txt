Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was as if the dirt were very soft, and not the striker very strong.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full understanding (e.g., "bime-by", "yer", "ol' beggar")
- [SPELLING/DIALECT] Consistent use of dialect ("Ches" dialogue) could challenge readers unfamiliar with the dialect

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the intense tunnel work description to the leisurely hunting trip without clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The shift in Jim's character from relentless worker to compassionate hunter, while coherent, might benefit from smoother character development cues
- [TRANSITION] The narrative jumps between different scenes (tunnel, evening, hunting) without strong transitional phrases

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
