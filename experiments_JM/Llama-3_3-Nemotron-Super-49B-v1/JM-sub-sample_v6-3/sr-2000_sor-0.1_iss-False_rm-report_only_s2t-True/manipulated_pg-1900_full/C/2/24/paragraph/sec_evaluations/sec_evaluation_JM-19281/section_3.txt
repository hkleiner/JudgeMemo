Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal vocabulary (e.g., "inexorably", "inescapable requirement") might reduce accessibility for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about universal spiritual yearnings and the role of Bahá'u'lláh's message could benefit from clearer contextualization for unfamiliar readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs occasionally feel abrupt, disrupting the narrative flow (e.g., the shift after "A voice command triggered automation.").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
