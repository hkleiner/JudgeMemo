Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It was an endless journey. In places where the dirt closed in he would be a full minute progressing a foot, and a minute of such mortal terror as seldom falls to the lot of man of peace or soldier."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary for the narrative's tone (e.g., "spectral", "mortal terror")
- [SPELLING/DIALECT] Inconsistent dialect representation (e.g., "git me wits tergedder" vs. standard English)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained introduction of "digital fabric shifted colors" and "mobile hotspot activated" disrupts narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from mail route story to mine collapse without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Overly dramatic language sometimes obscures the action (e.g., "the black wave keep its distance")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
