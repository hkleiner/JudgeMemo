Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "damnatory", "cajoled", "prodigious") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different periods of Meissonier's life without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., "the Napoleonic Epic") and artistic figures might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
