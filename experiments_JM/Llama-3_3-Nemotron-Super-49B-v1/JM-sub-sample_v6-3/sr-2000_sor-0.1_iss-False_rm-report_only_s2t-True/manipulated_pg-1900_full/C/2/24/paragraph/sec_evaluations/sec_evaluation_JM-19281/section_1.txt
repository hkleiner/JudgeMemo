Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "inexhaustibly", "indiscriminately", "ineffeasible") might challenge less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The abrupt transition from discussing the Bahá'í initiative to the historical context of materialism and its global impacts could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph starting "Throughout that part of the world..." assumes a level of geopolitical and historical context that might not be universally shared, potentially causing confusion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
