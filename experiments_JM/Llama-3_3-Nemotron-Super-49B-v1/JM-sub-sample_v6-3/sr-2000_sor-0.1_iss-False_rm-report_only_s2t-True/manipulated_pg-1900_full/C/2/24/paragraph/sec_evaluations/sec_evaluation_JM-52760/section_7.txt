Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the detailed attack plan description)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary without clear necessity (e.g., "ad libitum", "chevaux-de-frise", "abatis") for general readability

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the battle's outcome to introducing the next chapter ("FIVE FORKS: BEGINNING OF THE END") without a clear link
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of "Five Forks" without brief contextualization within the segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
