Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence transitions (e.g., "He strode forward... Several men started to interfere, but it wasn't necessary.")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial/dialectical language may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "wot", "yer", "hoits")
- [GRAMMAR] Informal grammar consistent with character dialogue but noticeable in narration (e.g., "I'd show 'em!")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from conflict to the passenger agent's interrogation without clear transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] The boy's backstory and relationship with the abusive couple could be more clearly established within this segment
- [LOGIC] The swift resolution of tension (woman's joke, man's retreat) feels somewhat convenient

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
