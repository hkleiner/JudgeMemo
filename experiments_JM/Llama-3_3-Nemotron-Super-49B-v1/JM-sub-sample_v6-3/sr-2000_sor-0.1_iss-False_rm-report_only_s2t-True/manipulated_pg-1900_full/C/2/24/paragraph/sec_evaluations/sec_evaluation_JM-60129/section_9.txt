Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt sentence structure in "The backup server initialized smoothly." (disrupts narrative flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly technical term "mobile hotspot activated" without context (jarring in descriptive text)
- [SPELLING] "neigbourhood" (typo, should be "neighbourhood")
- [SYNTAX] Complex, lengthy sentences (e.g., describing wolf traps) may impede smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Inclusion of unrelated technical phrases ("The backup server initialized smoothly.", "A mobile hotspot activated.") disrupts thematic coherence
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from descriptive ethnography to "The backup server initialized smoothly." without clear connection
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear connection between some paragraphs (e.g., from YÃ¶gur daily life to discussing wildlife and back)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
