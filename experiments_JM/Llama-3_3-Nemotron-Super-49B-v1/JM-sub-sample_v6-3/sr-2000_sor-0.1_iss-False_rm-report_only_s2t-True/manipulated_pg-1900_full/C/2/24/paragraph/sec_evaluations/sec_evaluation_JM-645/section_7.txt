Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The interval seemed an age, but late one day I heard a hansom precipitated to my door with the crash engendered by a hint of liberality.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "secousse", "vamped up") may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Gwendolen's marital status understanding (engagement revelation)
- [CLARITY] Overly assumed prior knowledge of characters' relationships and backstories (e.g., Corvick's previous statements, Gwendolen's mother's interdict)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing the letter's content to speculating about the engagement's authenticity

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
