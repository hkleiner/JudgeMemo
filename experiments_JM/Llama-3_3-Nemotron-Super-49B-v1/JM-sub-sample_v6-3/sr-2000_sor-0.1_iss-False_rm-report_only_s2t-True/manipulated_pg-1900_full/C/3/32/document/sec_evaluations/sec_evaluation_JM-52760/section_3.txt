Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "[stuff]" and "[thing]" placeholders, disrupting natural flow.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentence structures are overly complex (e.g., "The defenses of a thing now ran from the thing...").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers understand the context of "[stuff]" and "[thing]" without clarification.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt transition from discussing the siege to introducing the mine plan without clear connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
