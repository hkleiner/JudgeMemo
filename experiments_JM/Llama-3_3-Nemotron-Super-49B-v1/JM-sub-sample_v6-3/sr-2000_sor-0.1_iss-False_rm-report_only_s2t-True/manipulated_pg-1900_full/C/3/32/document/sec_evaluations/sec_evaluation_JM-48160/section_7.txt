Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I, therefore, inquired in my best manner if I could leave my things in the office and have déjeûner.")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices or phrases ("taube", "carnet rouge", "déjeûner") might require contextual understanding for non-French speakers, potentially disrupting flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive scenes, interactions, and reflections without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting the reader.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge (e.g., the significance of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", specifics of French military protocol) might reduce clarity for some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
