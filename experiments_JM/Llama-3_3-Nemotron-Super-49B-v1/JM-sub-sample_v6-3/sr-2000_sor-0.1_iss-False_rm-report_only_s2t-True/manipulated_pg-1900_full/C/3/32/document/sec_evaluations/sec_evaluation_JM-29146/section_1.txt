Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated throughout, e.g., "Your name ith Jathon Ramthey?")
- [SPELLING] "thith" instead of "this"
- [SPELLING] "nevertheleth" instead of "nevertheless"
- [SPELLING] "thurrender" instead of "surrender"
- [SPELLING] "ecth-captain" (inconsistent lisp application)
- [LEXICON] "planetarithed" (uncommon verb form, could be "nationalized" for clarity)
- [SPELLING] "stuff" likely should be "staff" (context suggests a group of people, not an object)
- [SPELLING] "stuffaghter" (unclear, possibly a typo with intended meaning unclear without context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's personal financial situation to the description of Irwadi's importance without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "on a stuff" is unclear (likely "on a staff" or similar, but impacts understanding).
- [LOGIC] The ease with which the narrative accepts the Irwadian's capability to manage hyper-space transfers despite earlier doubts could be more smoothly integrated.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the interaction at the spacefield to Chind Ramar's internal monologue about Irwadi's future plans feels somewhat disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
