Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Sleep well, oh! my Lord Cornwallis your last peaceful sleep for many a weary night."
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language in "Something like a sob mingled with the drum beats." (contextually understandable but slightly melodramatic)
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of exclamation marks and ellipses for dramatic effect

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's personal thoughts to addressing Cornwallis directly without clear narrative transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt change from the battle scene to the chapter title "CHAPTER VIII. - ANOTHER MESSAGE FOR DEBBY" without a smoother transition
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "the thing" when Robert mentions his home (unclear reference)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
