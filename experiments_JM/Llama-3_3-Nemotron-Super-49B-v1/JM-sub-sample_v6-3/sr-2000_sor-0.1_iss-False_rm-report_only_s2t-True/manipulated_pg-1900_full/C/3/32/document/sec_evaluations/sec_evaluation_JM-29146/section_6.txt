Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "X marks the spot, thought Ramsey. XXX marks the spot-spot-spot. X is a spot in a pot or a lot of rot...." (disrupts flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "stuff" without clear explanation early on may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "a thing smiled" (inconsistent article usage, should likely be "the thing" for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from romantic tension to Security Officer's scene without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from boat scene to Security Office) without clear connectors
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (especially Garr Symm's) not fully clear within this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
