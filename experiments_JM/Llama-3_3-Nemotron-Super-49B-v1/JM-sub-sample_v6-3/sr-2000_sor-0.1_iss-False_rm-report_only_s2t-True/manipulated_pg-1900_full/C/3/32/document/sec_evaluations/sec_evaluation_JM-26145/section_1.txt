Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "fellah√¨n", "dusky fellows") might require additional context for modern readers.
- [SPELLING/CONSISTENCY] Repeated use of "[stuff]" and "[thing]" suggests placeholders or errors, disrupting fluency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing tablet findings and shifting focus to the Egyptian Court in Chapter II.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., Amenophis III/IV's actions) without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
