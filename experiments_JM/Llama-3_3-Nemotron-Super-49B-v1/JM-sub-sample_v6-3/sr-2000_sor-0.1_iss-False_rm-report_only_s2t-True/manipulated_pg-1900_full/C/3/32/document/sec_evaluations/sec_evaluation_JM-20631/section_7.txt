Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "diurnal", "centripetal", "dynast") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced texts (e.g., "God the Invisible King", "The Gods of Germany") without brief context.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Old Testament's universalism to critiquing Mr. Wells and then to Abraham's story without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
