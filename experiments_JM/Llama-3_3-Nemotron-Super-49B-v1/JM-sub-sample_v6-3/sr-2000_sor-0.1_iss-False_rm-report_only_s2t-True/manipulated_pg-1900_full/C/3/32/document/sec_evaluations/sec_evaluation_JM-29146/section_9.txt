Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., Ramsey's internal monologue about time and hyper-space)
  - [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "mimsy", "borogroves", "momraths")
  - [PACING] Abrupt shifts in narrative pace (e.g., from intense dialogue to poetic descriptions of music)

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Vardin's character traits (from timid to assertive without clear motivation)
  - [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different groups (Ramsey's group and Garr Symm's group) without clear transitional cues
  - [CLARITY] The explanation of timelessness and its effects could be clearer for immediate understanding

3. FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
