Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "inextinguishable urge", "animating principle") might require a second read for full comprehension by general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumes a level of prior knowledge about Bahá'í teachings and its context without explicit explanation within the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between discussing different conceptions of religion and introducing Bahá'u'lláh's teachings could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
