Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "at the stuff", "the thing") might slightly hinder fluency for casual readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between discussing the open letter and shifting focus to the commentary "One Common Faith" could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Bahá'í history and principles might leave some readers unclear on specific references.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
