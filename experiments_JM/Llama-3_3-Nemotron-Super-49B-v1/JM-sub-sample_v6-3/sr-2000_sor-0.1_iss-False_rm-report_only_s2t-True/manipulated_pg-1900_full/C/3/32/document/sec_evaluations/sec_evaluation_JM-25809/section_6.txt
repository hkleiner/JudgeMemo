Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "t'rough" (should be "through"), "t'row" (should be "throw"), "youse" (should be "you"), "yer" (should be "you"), "dat" (should be "that"), "der" (should be "the"), "wot" (should be "what"), "s'help" (should be "so help"), "cud" (should be "could"), "doped" (contextually unclear, possibly "doped" is intended for humor or slang, but could confuse readers), "t'ink" (should be "think")
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense in some dialogue (e.g., "I'd give me heart's blood fur youse" - should be "I would give")
- [LEXICON] Informal language and slang may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "laddybuck", "slankin' an' snoopin' aroun'")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the emotional moment at the cabin to the detailed description of Jim's mining work without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the treasure which would make the world so different" lacks specificity, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the context from previous chapters.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the burro's greeting and the subsequent dialogue to Jim's reflection on mining feels somewhat disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
