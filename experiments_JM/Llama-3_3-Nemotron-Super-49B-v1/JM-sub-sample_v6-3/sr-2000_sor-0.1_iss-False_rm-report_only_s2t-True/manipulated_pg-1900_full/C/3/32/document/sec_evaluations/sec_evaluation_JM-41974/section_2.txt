Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If the models that passed in endless procession before his eyes impressed him as magnificent opportunities...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "enamoured", "disinterestedness", "mettlesome") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between biographical narrative, artistic style description, and specific project details without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of Veronese's works and historical context (e.g., "the Most Serene Republic") without brief explanations.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
