Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "She saw him not as a destroyer of her trust, but as the victim of circumstances...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutungs", "faggots", "amah") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Kuei Ping's introspection, her environment, and her family's situation without clear transitional phrases at times.
- [CLARITY] The symbolic transition from seeking freedom to finding joy through selflessness, while poignant, might be slightly abrupt for some readers without prior contextual buildup.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
