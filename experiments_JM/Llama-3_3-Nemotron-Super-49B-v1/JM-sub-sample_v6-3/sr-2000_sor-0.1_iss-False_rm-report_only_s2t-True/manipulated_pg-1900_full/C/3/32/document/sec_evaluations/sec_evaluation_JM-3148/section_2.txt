Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., long, nested sentences).
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "guerdon", "sternum" implied but not directly related to the text, yet "congress" shoe is a bit obscure) might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between Tony's childhood, his teenage years, and his skills without a clear transitional flow between these developmental stages.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the village's attitude towards Tony and the implications of his actions (e.g., the significance of repairing instruments for little reward) could be more explicitly stated for better understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
