Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "It is a strange thing how fortune will sometimes guide with certainty, when reason shows no path.")
  - [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for the narrative voice (e.g., "Ã¦sthetic pleasure", "hull bone")

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Jim's awe at the train to focusing on the boy without clear connection.
  - [CLARITY] The boy's situation and motivations could be more clearly established for immediate understanding.

3. FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4. FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
