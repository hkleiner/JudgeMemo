Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" used inconsistently (likely should be "staff" or a specific title)
- [LEXICON] "thing" used ambiguously (appears to replace a proper noun or title)
- [SYNTAX] "a thing to get his portfolios" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing, who was condemned" (inconsistent subject-verb agreement)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's personal life to the French Revolution's detailed timeline
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological events within the Revolution narrative (e.g., mentioning the 14th of July before fully establishing the pre-Revolution context)
- [CLARITY] Overly assumed knowledge of historical figures and events without introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
