Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It was a gay little party that got off an electric car..." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary for the narrative's tone (e.g., "the thing", "a stuff")
- [SPELLING/CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent terminology ("the thing" instead of a specific name, e.g., "Edinburgh" or another relevant term)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing the children's game to the doctor's call and then to the walk plans
- [STRUCTURE] Information about the Highland Regiment and its uniform feels somewhat tangential to the main narrative of the walk
- [CLARITY] The term "the thing" is unclear and detracts from understanding in several contexts

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
