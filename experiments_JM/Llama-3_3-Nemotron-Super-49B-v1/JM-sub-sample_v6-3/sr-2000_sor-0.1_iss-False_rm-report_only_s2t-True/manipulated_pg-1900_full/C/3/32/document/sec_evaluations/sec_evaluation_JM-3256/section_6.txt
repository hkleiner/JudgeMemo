Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sneaking fondness", "vellumed volumes", "uncropped, uncut, and unfoxed")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences require careful reading (e.g., the paragraph starting with "He that hath such friends...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the bookman's self-justifications to the broader reflection on book lovers' experiences (between paragraphs 5 and 6)
- [CLARITY] The quote about Heaven being "a bookmanâ€™s paradise" slightly disrupts the flow, feeling somewhat tangential without clearer introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
