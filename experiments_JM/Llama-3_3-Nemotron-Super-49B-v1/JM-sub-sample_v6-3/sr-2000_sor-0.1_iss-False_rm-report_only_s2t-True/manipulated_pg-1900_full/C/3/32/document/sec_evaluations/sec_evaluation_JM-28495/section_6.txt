Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He was not going to put his beloved mistress to shame by admitting to her relatives that he had not the faintest idea what she was talking about.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering," "gaunt man," "lathy") might require additional context or familiarity for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the detailed London reunion to the sudden shift in scene and tone at "CHAPTER: VII" without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The narrative leap from Excalibur's pursuit of the taxi to the coroner's jury and train accident feels disjointed, lacking a smooth contextual handoff.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
