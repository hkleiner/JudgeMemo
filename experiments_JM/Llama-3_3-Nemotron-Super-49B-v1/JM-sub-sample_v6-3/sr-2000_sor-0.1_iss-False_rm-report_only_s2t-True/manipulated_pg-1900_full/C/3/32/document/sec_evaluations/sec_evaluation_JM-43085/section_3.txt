Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary (e.g., "braggadocio", "sacerdotal sovereignty", "paradox") may hinder readability for non-expert readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences (e.g., the passage discussing the dimensions of Meissonier's paintings) could improve with clearer segmentation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The argument regarding the size of Meissonier's paintings, while engaging, feels somewhat defensive and disrupts the biographical flow.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing etchings to paintings ("But what of his paintings?...") could be smoother with a clearer transitional phrase.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
