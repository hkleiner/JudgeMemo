Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "In meeting, thy case hath been considered")
- [LEXICON] Archaic language may hinder modern readability (e.g., "stuff", "lass", "thou")
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (likely typo, context suggests "stuff" might mean "stuffing" or more likely a typo for "stuff" as in belongings or incorrect use, possibly meant "stuff" as in household goods or an error for "cottage" or similar)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional turmoil to the description of her life under Mrs. Lane
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, slightly obscuring the narrative flow
- [TRANSITION] The shift in time ("During the year...") could be smoother
