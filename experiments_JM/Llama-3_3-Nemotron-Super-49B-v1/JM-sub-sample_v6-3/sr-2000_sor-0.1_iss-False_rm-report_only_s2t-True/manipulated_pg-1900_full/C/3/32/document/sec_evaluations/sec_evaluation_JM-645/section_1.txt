Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, convoluted sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lucubrations", "ormolu") might require additional cognitive effort for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between past and present reflections without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (e.g., the narrator's true feelings about Vereker's work) and some plot points (e.g., the significance of the review for the narrator's confidence) could be more explicitly stated for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
