Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some dialogues (e.g., Ramsey's hyper-space explanation)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary might hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "sibilantless", "lateral")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances (not critically impacting overall fluency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Irwadi's plot to Vardin's scene without clear transitional context
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., between Symm's power dreams and the Enterprise preparations) might confuse without broader context
- [CLARITY] Some character motivations (e.g., Symm's long-term power goals) could be more explicitly connected to the immediate plot

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
