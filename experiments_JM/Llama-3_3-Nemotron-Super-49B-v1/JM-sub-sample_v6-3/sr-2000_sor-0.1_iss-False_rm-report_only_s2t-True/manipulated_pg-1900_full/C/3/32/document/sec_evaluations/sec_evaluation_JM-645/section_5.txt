Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some passages (e.g., "Deep down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy, I was expectant.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "bedlamitical", "stupefied")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (not explicitly found but potential given the narrative's complexity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnect between the narrator's expressed doubts and their continued engagement/intrigue
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs transition abruptly between different ideas or timelines (e.g., shifting between Corvick's pursuit and the narrator's reflections)
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally meanders, slightly delaying the progression of the central mystery

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
