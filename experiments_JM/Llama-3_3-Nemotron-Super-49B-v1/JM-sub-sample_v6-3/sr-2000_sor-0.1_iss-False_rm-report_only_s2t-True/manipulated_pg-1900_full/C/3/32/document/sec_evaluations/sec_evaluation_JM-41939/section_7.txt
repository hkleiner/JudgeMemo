Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "cemetery of the thing" (likely a typo, unclear what "the thing" refers to)
- [SYNTAX] "the cortège which followed her coffin was made up of every eminent figure" (slightly awkward phrasing, though clear)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the thing" cemetery without explanation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing death to describing the funeral cortège without a clear connector

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
