Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I did my best to sit very still, but I couldnâ€™t help giving a jump...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "stare", "quitted", "touvaille") may hinder readability for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Corvick's article to the accident in Torquay 
- [CLARITY] The narrator's motivations for asking about the article immediately after the tragedy could be clearer

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
