Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "inexhaustible", "sombre", "patrimony").
- [LENGTH] Some sentences are excessively long, potentially affecting flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing materialism's failure and introducing global integration without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] The connection between some examples (e.g., environmentalism/feminism and spiritual search) and the main point could be more explicitly stated.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs in some instances, disrupting the narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
