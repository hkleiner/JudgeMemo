Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "renannouncement", "futile theory", "amused at my impotence") may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional comma splices and run-on sentences (e.g., "I went still further—it was the only glimpse of happiness I had.")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about characters' thoughts/feelings without clear textual evidence (e.g., "He didn’t laugh—he wasn’t a laugher")
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from discussing the wife's death to analyzing the husband's behavior)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences require re-reading due to dense, convoluted phrasing (e.g., "That only made one—everything only made one—yearn the more for it")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
