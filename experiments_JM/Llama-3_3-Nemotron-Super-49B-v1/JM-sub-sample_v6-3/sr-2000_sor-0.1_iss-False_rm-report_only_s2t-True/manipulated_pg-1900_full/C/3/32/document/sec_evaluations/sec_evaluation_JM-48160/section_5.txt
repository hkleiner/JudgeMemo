Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I believe it was early in 1914 that some German General said the war would be won by the stoutest nerves.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full understanding (e.g., "réformé", "taubes", "horizon blue")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the train observation and the description of Châlons without a clear connecting thought
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical events (e.g., "what the matter was with Frenchmen in ‘70") without brief explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
