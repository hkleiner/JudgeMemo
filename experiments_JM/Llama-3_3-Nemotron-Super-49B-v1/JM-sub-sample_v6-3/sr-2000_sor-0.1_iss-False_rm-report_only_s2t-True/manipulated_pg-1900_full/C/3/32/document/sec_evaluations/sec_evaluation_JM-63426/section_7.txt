Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between discussing Bradley's failure as a business tycoon and the new chapter "NEW FIELDS"
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., from 1907 to an unspecified time in the "interpolation" chapter)
- [CLARITY] Unclear expectations and outcomes of the author's interactions (e.g., with Mr. Bok and Mr. Collier)
