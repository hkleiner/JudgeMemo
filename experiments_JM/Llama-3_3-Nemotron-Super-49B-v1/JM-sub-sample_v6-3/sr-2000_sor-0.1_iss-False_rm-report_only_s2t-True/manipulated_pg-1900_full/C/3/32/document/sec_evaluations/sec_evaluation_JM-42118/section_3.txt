Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "In distant the thing the making of history was growing apace." (missing article or incorrect phrase)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague term "a thing" (repeatedly used without clear reference)
- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "stuff d'Este" (should be "Villa d'Este" for consistency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's artistic development to historical/political events without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., discussing Choiseul's rise to power without clear relevance to Fragonard's story at that point)
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference points for "a thing" throughout, disrupting narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
