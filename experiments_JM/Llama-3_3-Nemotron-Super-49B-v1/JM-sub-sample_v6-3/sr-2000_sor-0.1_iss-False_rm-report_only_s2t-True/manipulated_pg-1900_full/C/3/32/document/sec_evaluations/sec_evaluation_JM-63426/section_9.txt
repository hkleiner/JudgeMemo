Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "And now there is little more to tell, unless you want to listen to the way I enthuse about our present-day illustrators..."
- [LEXICON] Informal tone ("God love them", "envy their fun") may disrupt formal flow in some contexts
- [SPELLING] "stuff" appears to be a placeholder or typo, repeated throughout

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing past projects to praising current illustrators
- [CLARITY] Vagueness in "the thing" and "a thing" without clear reference
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between the "TOWARDS A NEW STYLE" section and the shift towards "TODAY IN 1954"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
