Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, unclear what it refers to, possibly a placeholder or error)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "voluntarily to debar oneself", "amply sufficient to itself")
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph discussing Colbert and Louis XIV)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the painting's beauty to the Inquisition trial
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures and events without brief context (e.g., Philip II, the Venetian Republic's laws)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear linking between the end of the "Wedding at Cana" description and the introduction of "These four Feasts"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
