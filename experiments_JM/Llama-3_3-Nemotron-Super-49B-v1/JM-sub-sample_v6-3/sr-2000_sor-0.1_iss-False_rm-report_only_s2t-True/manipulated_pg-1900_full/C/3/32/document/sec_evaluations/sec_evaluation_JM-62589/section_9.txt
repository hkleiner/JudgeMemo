Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Under the wintry sun Morley lay sleeping, and beside him sat Robert, lost in dazed thought."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in "the dearest face on earth were bending over him" (archaic tone)
- [PUNCTUATION] Lack of clarity with multiple short sentences without transitional punctuation (e.g., "No fear... As the day...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Robert's concern for his wound to suddenly hearing distant firing without clear connection
- [TRANSITION] Sudden introduction of "the stuff" without explanation (appears to be a typo/error, disrupting clarity)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential thought process in Robert's reflections after Morley's death (jumps between messages, his condition, and the battle)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
