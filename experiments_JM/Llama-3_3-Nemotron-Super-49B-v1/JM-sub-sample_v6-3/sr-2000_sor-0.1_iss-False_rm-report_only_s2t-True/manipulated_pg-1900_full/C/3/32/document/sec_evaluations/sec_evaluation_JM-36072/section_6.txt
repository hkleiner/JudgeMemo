Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "The greatness of the age, as I have said, depended on a combination of circumstances in their nature transient.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stuff", "tertius gaudens") without clear explanation
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense in a few instances (e.g., "it was" to "we shall")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing literary figures and societal critique
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear, focused topic, making the flow somewhat disjointed
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between ideas (e.g., from Victorian literature to the impact of the Industrial Revolution)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
