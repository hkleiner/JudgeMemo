Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, unclear what it refers to, e.g., "a thing at the stuff", "the stuff delivered his final address")
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the paragraph discussing Reynolds' approach to mastering various artists' techniques)
- [LEXICON] Archaic or unclear terms without context (e.g., "a thing Cathedral", "the stuff")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Reynolds' last days to analyzing his artwork's standing against all dead masters
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers understand the context of "a thing" without clear explanation
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the biographical section and the analytical section on his art style

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
