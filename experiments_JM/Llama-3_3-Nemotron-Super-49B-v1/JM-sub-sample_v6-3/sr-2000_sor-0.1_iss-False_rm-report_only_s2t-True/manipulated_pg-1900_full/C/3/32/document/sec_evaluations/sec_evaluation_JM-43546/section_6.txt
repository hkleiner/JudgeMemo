Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, unclear what it refers to, e.g., "found in the stuff", "a stuff of that time", "a stuff tired")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms (e.g., "a thing", "the thing")
- [SYNTAX] Simple sentence structures dominate, lacking variety

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from describing Abbotsford to introducing "CHAPTER: THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in scene (from Dryburgh Abbey to the Gordon house) without transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "a thing" in "Doctor and Mrs. Gordon, Don, and a thing")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
