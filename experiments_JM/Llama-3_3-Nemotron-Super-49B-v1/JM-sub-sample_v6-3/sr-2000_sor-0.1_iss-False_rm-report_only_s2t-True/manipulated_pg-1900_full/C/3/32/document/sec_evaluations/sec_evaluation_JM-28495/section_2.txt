Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may slightly impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "quaking consort", "starchy white curtains") might require a brief pause for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from the chase scene to the golf course walk feels somewhat disconnected without transitional context.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different times/events (chase, home, naming the dog) without clear temporal anchors.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
