Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "It was not much help, but it was a diversion.")
- [LEXICON] Informal language and slang (e.g., "t'ump", "smeller") may affect readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had undertaken" to "had been turned")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the deer fight scene to the conversation about the boy's father
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps abruptly from the immediate aftermath of the deer fight to a reflective, philosophical statement ("A good incident is an opal among gems in a lonely life.")
- [LOGIC] The shift in scene to the home trip and then to the serious conversation about the boy's father feels somewhat disjointed without clearer transitional context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
