Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., the description of the monks' reaction to Becket's attire)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "stuff", "thou", "thee" not present but "thing" is misused)
- [SPELLING] Misuse of "thing" instead of "he" or "the Archbishop" in multiple instances

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the murder scene to the discussion of Becket's canonization process
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed description of Becket's garments and their discovery may distract from the main narrative flow
- [LOGIC] The swift transition from fear of sacrilege to the killing, without fully exploring the knights' change in behavior

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
