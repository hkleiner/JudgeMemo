Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "In his hand he held a tablet on which was fastened a sheet of white paper, and he was carefully sketching himself, studying his reflection in a mirror.")
- [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "cumbered", "redingote", "breeches of white cashmere") might require additional comprehension effort for non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Meissonier's sketching scene to discussing his collection and working library.
- [CLARITY] The quote "My model can't pose as Napoleon, but I have exactly a thing's legs" could benefit from clearer context or explanation within the provided segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
