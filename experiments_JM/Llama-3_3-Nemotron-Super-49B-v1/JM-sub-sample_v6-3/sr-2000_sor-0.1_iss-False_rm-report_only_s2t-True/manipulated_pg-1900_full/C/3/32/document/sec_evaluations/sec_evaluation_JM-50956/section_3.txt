Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a stuff", "a thing") hindering clarity.
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some passages.
- [SPELLING/Grammar] No major spelling errors, but some grammatical constructions feel slightly archaic or awkward.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., specific battles, figures) without clear explanation.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between discussing different time periods and locations (e.g., from Warsaw to Ypres without clear connectors).
- [CLARITY] Overly defensive tone in some sections (e.g., responding to Ludendorf) slightly distracts from the main narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
