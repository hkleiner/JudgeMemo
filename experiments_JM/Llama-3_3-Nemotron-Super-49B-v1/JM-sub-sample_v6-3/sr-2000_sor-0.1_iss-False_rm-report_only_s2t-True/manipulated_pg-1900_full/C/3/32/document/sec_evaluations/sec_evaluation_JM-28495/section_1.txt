Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bonhomie", "dernier cri") might require additional processing for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the tram ride, dog purchase discussions, and the pursuit in Battersea without clear transitional phrases, potentially disorienting readers.
- [CLARITY] The humor in the boy's response and the decision to follow the official could be more clearly set up for immediate understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
