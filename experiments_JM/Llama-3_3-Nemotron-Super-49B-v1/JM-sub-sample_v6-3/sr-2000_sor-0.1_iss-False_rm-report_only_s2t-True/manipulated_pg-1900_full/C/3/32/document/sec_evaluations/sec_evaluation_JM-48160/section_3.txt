Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "surging mass of soldiers", "pêle-mêle", "taube") might require additional processing for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptive scenes and reflective thoughts without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of the war context (e.g., "the stuff", "taube") and French culture might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
