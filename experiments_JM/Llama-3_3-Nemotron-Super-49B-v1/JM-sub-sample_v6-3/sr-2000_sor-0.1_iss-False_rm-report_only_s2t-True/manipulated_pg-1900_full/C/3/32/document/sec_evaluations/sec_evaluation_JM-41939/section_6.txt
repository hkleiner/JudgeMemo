Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, unclear what "stuff" refers to, possibly a typo or translation error)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal and less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "inflexible sincerity", "psychic intensity") may hinder readability for non-expert readers
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., the quote from M. Roger Mil√®s) may impede smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Rosa Bonheur's art to her personal life and back (e.g., from animal paintings to Mlle. Micas's health)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain events (e.g., "the campaign"), figures (e.g., "the Emperor"), and locations (e.g., "the stuff") without clear context
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal markers between significant life events

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
