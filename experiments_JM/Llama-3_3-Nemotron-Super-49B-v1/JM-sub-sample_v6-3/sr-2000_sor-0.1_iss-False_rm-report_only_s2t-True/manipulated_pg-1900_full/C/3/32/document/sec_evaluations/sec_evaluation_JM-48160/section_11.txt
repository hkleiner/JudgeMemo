Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was shortly after we left Bar-le-Duc that Major C., consoled by my assurance...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices or phrases ("a thing", repeated for anonymity) feel out of place or overly casual for the narrative's tone.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected within the provided segment.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the newsboys to the narrative about Major C.'s story and then to the Lieutenant's house (lacks smooth connectivity between these distinct scenes).
- [CLARITY] The document dropped by the "Bosche" and its content, while historically contextual, feels somewhat tangential to the immediate narrative flow without clearer integration.
- [TRANSITION] The shift to describing "LE BIENÊTRE DU BLESSÉ" feels disconnected from the preceding events without a bridging element.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
