Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "My cheap review fluttered off into space, and the best things I had said in it became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "unmodulated", "stupefaction") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Slight abruptness in shifting from dinner table conversation to the narrator's dejection and then to the encounter with Vereker in the passage (could benefit from smoother transitions).
- [CLARITY] Vereker's sudden depth of emotion and the narrator's quick shift in perception could be more explicitly connected for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
