Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "She had assisted in a secondary capacity at funerals in the families of other people, but she would have revelled in personally conducted ones.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "cabined, cribbed, confined", "revelled")
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs without clear sectioning

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical musings to narrative (between Anthony Croft and Aunt Hitty sections)
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "the thing", "the stuff, or Lawrence, or Haverhill, Massachusetts")
- [FOCUS] Tangential details (e.g., extensive planning for the funeral, while interesting, slightly detracts from the main narrative flow)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
