Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "a thing" and "a stuff" used repeatedly without clear definition or context, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Complex, overly long sentences (e.g., paragraphs discussing Russia's role and future implications) hinder smooth reading.
- [CLARITY] Lack of specificity in phrases like "certain stages" and "somewhat earlier, or somewhat later" reduces precision.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that Russia's future power is inevitable without fully addressing the "Bolshevism" context.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from historical analysis to speculative future scenarios without a clear transitional link.
- [TRANSITION] The connection between the World War I discussion and the potential for future conflicts feels disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
