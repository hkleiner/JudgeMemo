Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in several places (e.g., "The stuff gladly snatched at the invitation...", "It was as safe to remain in Paris as to leave the city.")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("the thing", "stuff") which disrupts clarity
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistencies in tense (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between historical events and Fragonard's personal story
- [CLARITY] Overly broad time jumps without clear contextual bridges (e.g., from 1794 to 1903)
- [LOGIC] Fragonard's emotional state and actions not fully logically connected to the broader historical context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
