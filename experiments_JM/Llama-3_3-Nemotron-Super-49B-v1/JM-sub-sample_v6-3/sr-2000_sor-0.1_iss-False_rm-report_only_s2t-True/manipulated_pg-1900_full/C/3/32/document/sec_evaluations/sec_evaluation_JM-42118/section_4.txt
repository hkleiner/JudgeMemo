Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, unclear what it refers to, possibly a placeholder or error)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs may impede smooth reading
- [LEXICON] Archaic language ("thou", "thee" not present but "a thing" is unclear) and unclear terms ("a thing")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between Fragonard's biography and historical/political events (e.g., Choiseul and Jesuits)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., back to Fragonard after detailed historical context)
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "the thing" without clear antecedent)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
