Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "dunce", "raisons d’être", "journalese") might require additional processing time for less familiar readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] The central mystery ("the little point") remains intentionally vague, which, while engaging, might frustrate readers seeking clearer resolution within this segment.
- [STRUCTURE] The dialogue-driven narrative, while mostly effective, has moments where the back-and-forth feels slightly prolonged without significant new insight.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
