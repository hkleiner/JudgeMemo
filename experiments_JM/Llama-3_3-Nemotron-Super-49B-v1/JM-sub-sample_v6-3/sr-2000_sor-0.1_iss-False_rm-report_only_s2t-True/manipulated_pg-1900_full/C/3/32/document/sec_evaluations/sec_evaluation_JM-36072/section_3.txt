Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "The problem of mending or ending industrialism...").
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stuff", "solatium", "potations", "intemperance") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but "stuff" is used ambiguously/incompletely, potentially causing confusion.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between discussing Law, Universities, Civil Service, etc., without clear thematic connectors.
- [CLARITY] Overuse of unspecified references (e.g., "the stuff", "a thing") without clear explanation or context.
- [LOGIC] Leap from criticizing Victorian social reformers to discussing legal and university reforms feels disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
