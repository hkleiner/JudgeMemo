Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "She passed safely out of the womenâ€™s division of the compound, stealing through the intricate lacery of courtyards and curious-shaped gateways, stopping to dabble her fingers in the waters of a fountain...")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might reduce readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "lacery", "quarrying" not present but similar antiquated feel in some descriptions)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The abrupt shift from the detailed wedding ceremony to Kuei Ping's nighttime escape feels somewhat disconnected without a clearer transitional phrase or sentence.
- [CLARITY] The motivation behind Kuei Ping's decision to leave the compound at night could be more explicitly stated for immediate understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
