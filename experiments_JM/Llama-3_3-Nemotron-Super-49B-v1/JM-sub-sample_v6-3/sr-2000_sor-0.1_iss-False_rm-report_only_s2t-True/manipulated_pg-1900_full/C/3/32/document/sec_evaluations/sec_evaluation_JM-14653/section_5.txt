Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "You will perceive, if not at once, later, that you have bitten off just about as much as you can chew.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "omniscient", "futile and deleterious", "trifles")
- [LENGTH] Some paragraphs are excessively long, potentially hindering smooth reading flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in topic from cultivating goodwill in general to focusing on children's perceptions without clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] The section "CHAPTER: SEVEN - THE GIFT OF ONESELF" feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding text on goodwill cultivation methods
- [CLARITY] The instruction to "minimise his good fortune" and "magnify his efforts after righteousness" could be clearer in its application to goodwill cultivation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
