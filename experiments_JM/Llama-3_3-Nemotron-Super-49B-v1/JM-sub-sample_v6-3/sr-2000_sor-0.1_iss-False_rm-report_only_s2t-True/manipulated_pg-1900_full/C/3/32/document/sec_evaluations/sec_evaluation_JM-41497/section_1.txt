Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "stuff's lists", "the thing") could confuse modern readers without context.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between biographical narrative and art analysis without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of 18th-century art and figures (e.g., Gainsborough, Romney) might reduce accessibility.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
