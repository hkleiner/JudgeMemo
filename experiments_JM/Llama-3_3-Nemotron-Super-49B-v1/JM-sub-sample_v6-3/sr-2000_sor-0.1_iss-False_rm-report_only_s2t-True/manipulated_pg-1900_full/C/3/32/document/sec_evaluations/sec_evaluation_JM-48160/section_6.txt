Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "supererogatory", "surging mass of soldiers as 'properties'") might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the current experience in Châlons/Bar-le-Duc and a reflection on a previous train ride without a clear transitional link.
- [CLARITY] The abrupt shift from describing the hotel experience to the train observation from Paris to Châlons slightly disrupts the flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
