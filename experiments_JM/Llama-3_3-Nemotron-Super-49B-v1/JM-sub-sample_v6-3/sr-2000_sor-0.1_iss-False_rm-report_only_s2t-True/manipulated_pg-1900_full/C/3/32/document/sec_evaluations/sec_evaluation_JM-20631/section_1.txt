Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the town of the stuff" (lack of clarity)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for non-specialist audiences (e.g., "recondite", "esoteric")
- [SPELLING] "a thing", "a stuff" appear to be placeholders or errors, disrupting flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Arthur Davis to the broader topic of Hebrew revival without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential discussion of historical and contemporary examples without clear thematic progression
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference points (e.g., "a thing", "the stuff") that assume external context not provided in the segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
