Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, likely a placeholder or error for a specific term, e.g., "family", "state", "church")
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "ennobled", "solicit", "detrimental deterioration")
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the description of "The Family of Darius")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the biographical section and the detailed description of "The Family of Darius"
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures and events (e.g., the context of "The Family of Darius" and the significance of the Ducal Palace)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between paragraphs discussing different artworks and periods of Veronese's life

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
