Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of pronouns ("the thing", "a thing") without clear antecedent, causing confusion.
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("stuff", "a thing") instead of specific names or descriptions, hindering clarity.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the reader is familiar with all referenced locations and their strategic importance without additional context.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the detailed battle narrative and the analytical paragraph on the significance of Five Forks.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the thing" is used ambiguously and could refer to different entities, requiring inference.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
