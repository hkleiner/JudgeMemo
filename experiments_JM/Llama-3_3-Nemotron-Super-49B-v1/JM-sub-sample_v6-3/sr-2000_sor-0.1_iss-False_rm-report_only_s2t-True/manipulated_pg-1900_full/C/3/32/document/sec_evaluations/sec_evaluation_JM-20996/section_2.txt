Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon the old stone bridge..." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary in some contexts (e.g., "inexpressible", "elastic step") might slightly impede readability for all audiences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the bridge scene to the notice about supplies (could benefit from a clearer link)
- [CLARITY] The phrase "a thing" is used ambiguously (referring to the city, then seemingly to a location or concept without clear definition)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
