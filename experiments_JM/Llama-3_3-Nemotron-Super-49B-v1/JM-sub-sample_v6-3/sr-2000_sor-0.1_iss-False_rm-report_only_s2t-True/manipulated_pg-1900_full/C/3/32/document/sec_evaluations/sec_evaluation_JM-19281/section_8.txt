Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Some vocabulary (e.g., "inextricably," "paradoxically") might be challenging for non-native English speakers or those without a high reading proficiency.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition between discussing unity and then shifting to the topic of evil in the last paragraph could be smoother.
- [TRANSITION] The connection between the Bahá'í community's unity and the broader discussion on faith and evil could be more explicitly stated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
