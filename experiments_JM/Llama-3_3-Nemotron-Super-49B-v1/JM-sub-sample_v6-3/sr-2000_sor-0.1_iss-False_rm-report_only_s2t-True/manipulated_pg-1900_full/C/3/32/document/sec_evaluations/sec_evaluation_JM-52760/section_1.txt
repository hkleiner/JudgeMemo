2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical context and strategic plans (e.g., from Prologue to UNION STRATEGY 1864)
- [CLARITY] Unclear references ("the stuff", "a thing", "the thing") hinder understanding of geographical and military units
- [LOGIC] Assumption of prior knowledge about the war's context and figures without introduction
