Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her dowry jewels.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe", "luminous pearls") might require a second read for full comprehension by modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the jewel selection scene to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school (could benefit from a smoother transition).
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative's non-linear progression, while effective, assumes the reader will easily follow the time jump without explicit cues.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
