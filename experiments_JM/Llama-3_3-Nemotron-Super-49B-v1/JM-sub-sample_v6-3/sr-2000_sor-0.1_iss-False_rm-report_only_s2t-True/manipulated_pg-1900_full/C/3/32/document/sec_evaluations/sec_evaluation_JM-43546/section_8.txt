Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "What was it all about? Well, it was St. Patrick's Day..." (abrupt transition)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some descriptions (e.g., "great jollification", "greatest poet") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the stuff" (unclear reference, assuming "stuff" refers to a specific group or thing not clearly defined in the provided segment)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from New Year's Eve to St. Patrick's Day without clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt change in scene from Kelvin House to the street without preparatory context
- [CLARITY] Unclear context for "the thing" (assumed to be a household or family, but not explicitly stated in the segment)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
