Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" used inconsistently (likely should be "state" or "territory")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "a thing" (appears to be a placeholder or error)
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between historical events without clear chronological markers
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent depth of detail across different sections
- [CLARITY] "A thing" placeholder causes confusion throughout

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
