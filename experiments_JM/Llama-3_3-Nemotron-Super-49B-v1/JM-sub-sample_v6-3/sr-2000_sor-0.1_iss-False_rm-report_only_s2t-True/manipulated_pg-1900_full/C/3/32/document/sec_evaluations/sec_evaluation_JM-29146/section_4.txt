Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly descriptive and repetitive focus on physical appearance (e.g., multiple descriptions of Margot's body and attire)
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structure for dramatic effect (e.g., "Darn her hide, she was beautiful! What did she expect? Looking at her, how could a man concentrate....")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (not critically impacting readability)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Margot's tone and behavior (from playful to cold) without clear motivation
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the tense situation to a business negotiation without sufficient build-up
- [CLARITY] Some interactions and character intentions (e.g., the true nature of Margot's plan) could be clearer

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
