Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, likely a typo for "stuff" or a specific term not defined in the context provided)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in paragraphs (e.g., the last paragraph before the section on "Man with the Hoe") may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "pecuniary", "disarmed") might require additional effort for less advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Millet's financial struggles and the introduction of "Man with the Hoe" (lacks a clear connecting sentence).
- [CLARITY] The purpose and outcome of Millet's contract with the speculators could be more clearly summarized.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from detailing specific artworks to discussing the artist's later life events feels somewhat disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
