Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "You tell him about your father and that you are going back to Boston to study art. He suggests your stopping off in Chicago to see him. Says he can perhaps help you." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("the thing", "stuff") which, while possibly intentional for stylistic or period effect, may cause minor confusion
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles in a few places (e.g., "a room for you at home of a friend") for strict grammar adherence

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the print shop to the Chicago studio without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about terms like "atelier of the stuff" without explanation, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the context
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift in time ("A few months later...") without a transitional phrase for smoother flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
