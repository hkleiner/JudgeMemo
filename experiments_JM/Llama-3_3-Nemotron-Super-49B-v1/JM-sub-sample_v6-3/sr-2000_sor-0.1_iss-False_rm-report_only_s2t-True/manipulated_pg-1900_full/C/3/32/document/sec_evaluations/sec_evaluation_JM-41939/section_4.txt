- [LEXICON] Overuse of "a thing" (inconsistent with surrounding context, suggests missing information)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between describing the menagerie and shifting to art reputation and travels
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge (e.g., "the stuff" without clear reference)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between paragraphs discussing different aspects of Rosa Bonheur's life and work

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
