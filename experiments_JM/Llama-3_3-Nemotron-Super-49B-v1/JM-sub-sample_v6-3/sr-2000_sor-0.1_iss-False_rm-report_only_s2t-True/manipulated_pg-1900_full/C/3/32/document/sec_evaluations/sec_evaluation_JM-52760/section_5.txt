Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "stuff" (repeatedly used, likely a placeholder or error for a specific location/name, e.g., "Petersburg" or "Richmond")
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing", "the stuff") hindering clarity
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs may impede smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] Frequent use of undefined terms ("a thing", "the stuff") disrupts understanding
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different time frames (e.g., jumping from August to September without clear connectors)
- [LOGIC] Assumption of prior knowledge about locations and their strategic importance without brief contextualization

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
