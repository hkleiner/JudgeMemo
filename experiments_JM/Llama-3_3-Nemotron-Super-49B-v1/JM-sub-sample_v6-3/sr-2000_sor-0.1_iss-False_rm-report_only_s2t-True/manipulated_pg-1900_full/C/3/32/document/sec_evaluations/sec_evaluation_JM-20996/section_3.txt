Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can fathom the human heart?" (lacks transitional flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language ("drama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other") may disrupt smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from emotional scene to "CHAPTER IV" without a clear narrative bridge
- [TRANSITION] Lack of connection between the intense emotional description and the subsequent chapter's introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
