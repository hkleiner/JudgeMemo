Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He had human weaknesses to live down, and it is to his credit that he conquered all or most of them.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stuff" likely being a typo or archaic term, "comique", "gall") may require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumps between biography, artistic philosophy, and historical context without clear transitions).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., "the thing" likely referring to an unspecified entity related to the Royal Academy's development, requiring external context).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
