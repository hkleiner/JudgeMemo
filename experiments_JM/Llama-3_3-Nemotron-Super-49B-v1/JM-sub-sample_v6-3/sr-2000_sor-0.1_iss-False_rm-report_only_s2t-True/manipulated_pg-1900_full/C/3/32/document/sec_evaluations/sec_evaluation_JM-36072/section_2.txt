Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "We must remember that the progress was real, and that its speed was unexampled in history." (could be split for clarity)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "a thing" (repeatedly used without clear reference)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the stuff the barbarous..." (likely typo, "stuff" should be "such" or similar for coherence)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing economic hardships to introducing Carlyle and Ruskin without clear linking sentence
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential discussion of historical events and social commentary (e.g., jumping between 18th-century conditions and Victorian-era literature)
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "a thing" throughout (assumed to be a placeholder or error, causing confusion)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
