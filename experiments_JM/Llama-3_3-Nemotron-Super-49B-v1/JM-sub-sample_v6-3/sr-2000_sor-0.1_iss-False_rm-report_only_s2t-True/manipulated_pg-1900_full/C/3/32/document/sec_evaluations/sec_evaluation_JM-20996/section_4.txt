Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "It was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money; that they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a table loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were enthusiastic witnesses.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "stuff", "thing", "tidylic a dream" likely a typo for "idyllic")
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in "the stuff" and "the thing" without clear context within the segment

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the dance to discussing household economics without a clear link
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from a social gathering to a discussion of housekeeping challenges without a smooth transition or clear connection
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences between distinct scenes (e.g., from the party to the housekeeping story)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
