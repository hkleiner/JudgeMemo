Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The thing waited beside the road, until the pain in his hand turned him sick, but Morley came not."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary (e.g., "waning light", "daredevil boy") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had gleaned" after "have been riding")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Robert's ability to mimic Morley without prior indication of such skill.
- [CLARITY] The transition between Robert's recovery and the appearance of the new voices could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding context (though this might be due to the excerpt nature).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
