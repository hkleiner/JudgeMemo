Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "I hadn’t so much as hinted at that: no wonder the writer hadn’t been flattered!").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require a second read for full comprehension (e.g., "perversely", "supersubtlety").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from the protagonist's failure to understand Vereker's work to discussing George Corvick's intentions without clear transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] The inclusion of the letter from Hugh Vereker, while relevant, feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative without a smoother lead-in.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
