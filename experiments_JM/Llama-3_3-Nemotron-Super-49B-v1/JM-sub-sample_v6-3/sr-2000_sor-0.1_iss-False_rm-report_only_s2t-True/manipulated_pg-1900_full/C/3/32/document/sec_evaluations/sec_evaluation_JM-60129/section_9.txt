Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "You see them, humming a scrap of song, making their way carefully through the tightly packed flock of sheep, carrying one or two lambs under their arms, kissing and caressing the bleating animals.")
- [LEXICON] Some terms (e.g., "t'umu", "kekliks", "Dungan revolt") assume prior knowledge without explanation within the segment.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between descriptive narratives, daily life observations, and specific event descriptions without a clear transitional flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumed context for certain practices (e.g., chanting prayers at "praying places") without brief elaboration for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
