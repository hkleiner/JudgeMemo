Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate understanding.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "scabrous", "muck-rake", "Pantisocracy") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's familiarity with referenced works (e.g., "The Faerie Queene", "Paradise Lost", specific Tennyson poems) without brief contextualization.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing Tennyson's work, Victorian era characteristics, and modern critiques without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
