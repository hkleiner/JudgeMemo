Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It was on this day that the stuff sent from the thing four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to establish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public schools." (repetitive phrasing and unclear subject)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal and archaic language in some passages (e.g., "wonted devotion", "unrequited for his time and his money") may hinder smooth reading for modern readers
- [SPELLING] "the stuff" and "the thing" appear to be placeholders or errors, disrupting fluency

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the ship's departure to discussing tourist attractions in Honolulu without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear context or explanation for "the stuff" and "the thing", leaving the reader confused
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of Chapter I and the start of Chapter II, feeling somewhat disconnected

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
