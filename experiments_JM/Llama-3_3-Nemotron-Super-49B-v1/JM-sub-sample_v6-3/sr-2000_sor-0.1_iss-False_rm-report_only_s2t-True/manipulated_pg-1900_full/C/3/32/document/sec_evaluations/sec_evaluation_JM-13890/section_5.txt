Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "the fact that Canterbury remained the chief centre of the authority and state of the English Church prevented the city from decaying.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "throng", "unwholesome concourse", "opalescent") might require reader effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and descriptive tourism section (e.g., shift from "Having reached its greatest glories..." to "A thing that look over Canterbury...").
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "a thing" in multiple contexts without clear immediate reference).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
