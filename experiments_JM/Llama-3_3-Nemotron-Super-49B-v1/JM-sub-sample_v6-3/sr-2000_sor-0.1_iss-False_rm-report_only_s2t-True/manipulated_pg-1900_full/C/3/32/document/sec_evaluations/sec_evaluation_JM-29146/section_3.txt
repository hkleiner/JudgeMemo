Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thertainly", "wath", "thtink" (consistent but incorrect lisping representation could be more subtly handled)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "said" in dialogue tags (varied dialogue attributions could enhance readability)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in introspective passages (e.g., "The thing which got Ramsey...") may hinder smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from descriptive narrative to introspective analysis (e.g., "The thing which got Ramsey...") without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of character backstory ("Earth, being top dog...") feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate conflict
- [CLARITY] The character's internal thoughts and the narrative's pace sometimes clash, slightly obscuring the immediate tension (e.g., detailed descriptions during intense moments)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
