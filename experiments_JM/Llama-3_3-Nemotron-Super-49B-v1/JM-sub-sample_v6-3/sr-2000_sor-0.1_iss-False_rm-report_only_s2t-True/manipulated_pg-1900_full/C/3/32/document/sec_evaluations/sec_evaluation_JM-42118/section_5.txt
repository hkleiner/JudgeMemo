Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It is part of the irony of life that a thing, who never entered into the favourite's friendship, should have become the recognised artist of her day.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "stuff", "a thing" used ambiguously, "make-believe")
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous pronoun references (e.g., repeated use of "a thing" without clear antecedent)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Du Barry and introducing Fragonard's marriage (lacks smooth connection)
- [LOGIC] Assumption of reader's prior knowledge (e.g., not fully explaining the significance of "The Progress of Love" series initially)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal markers between events (e.g., jumping from Fragonard's work to his marriage without clear time indicators)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
