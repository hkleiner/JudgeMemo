Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Not long after he had enlisted he was sitting, with some others, around a camp fire trying to forget, in the grateful glow, how hungry and cold he was"
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms ("the stuff", "a thing") for unclear objects/places
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles in several places (e.g., "entered headquarters of the bedraggled army entrenched on a thing")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Debby's decision to join the army to introducing "Robert Shirtliffe" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Chapter IV's beginning to the camp fire scene without contextual bridge
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "the stuff" and "a thing" throughout, hindering understanding of locations and objects

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
