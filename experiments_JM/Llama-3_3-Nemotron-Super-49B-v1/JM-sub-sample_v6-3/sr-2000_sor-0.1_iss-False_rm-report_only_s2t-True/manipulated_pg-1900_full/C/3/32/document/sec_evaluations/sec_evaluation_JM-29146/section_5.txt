Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He awoke with anxious hands fluttering at his shoulder. Opening one sleepy eye, he saw the Vegan girl." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "the thing girl" (could benefit from more descriptive or consistent naming)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of the proto-man concept without prior context or clear connection to the plot (may confuse readers without additional setup)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from the apartment scene to the detailed letter content (could use a smoother transition)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
