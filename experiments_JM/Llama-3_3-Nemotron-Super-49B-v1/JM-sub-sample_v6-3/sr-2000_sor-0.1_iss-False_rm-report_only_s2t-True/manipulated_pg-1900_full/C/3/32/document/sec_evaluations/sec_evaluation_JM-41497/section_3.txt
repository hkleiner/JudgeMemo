2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the gallery's success and introducing "The Club" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge (e.g., "the thing", specific artworks without introduction).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from biography to speculative analysis of the artist's personal life without a clear link.
