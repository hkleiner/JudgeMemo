Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "A blur passed over Masonâ€™s eyes. His senses became more muddled." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "the thing" (e.g., "General the thing", "the thing was crying") which disrupts fluency due to its unclear meaning and repetition
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "in British uniform" (should be "a British uniform" for consistency, though this is a minor issue)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of the second character resembling Robert without prior hint or explanation
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the camp's situation to Robert's solo quest without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Mason's condition and actions (e.g., mistaking Robert, pleading for whisky) could be more clearly connected to his character development or the plot's progression

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
