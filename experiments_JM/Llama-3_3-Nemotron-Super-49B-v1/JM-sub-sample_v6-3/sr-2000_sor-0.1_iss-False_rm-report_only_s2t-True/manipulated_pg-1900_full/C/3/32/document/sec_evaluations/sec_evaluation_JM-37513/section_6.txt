Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several places (e.g., "We need a term by which to designate that which is thus inherent and constitutional.")
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "self-contained system", "ground" in a non-standard context) may hinder readability for some readers.
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs without clear subsections or breaks.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with Spencer's works without sufficient context or summary.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing "force" and "relatedness" to introducing "cause and conditions" without a clear connecting statement.
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts (e.g., distinction between "ground", "conditions", and "cause") not fully elaborated for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
