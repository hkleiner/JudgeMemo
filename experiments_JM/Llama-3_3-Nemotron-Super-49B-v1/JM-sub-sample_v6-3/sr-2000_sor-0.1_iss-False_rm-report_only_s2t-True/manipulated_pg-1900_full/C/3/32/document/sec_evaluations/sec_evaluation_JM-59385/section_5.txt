Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage in some paragraphs (e.g., switching between past simple and past perfect without clear narrative justification).
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary in certain descriptions may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "weariness that made work almost impossible").
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures that, while grammatically correct, slow down the reading flow (e.g., the sentence starting with "Knowledge and careful nursing...").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from the family's joyful moments to the introduction of war news and its immediate emotional impact feels somewhat disconnected.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Fuh Tang's health decline to the birth and death of the second son without a clear transitional link.
- [CLARITY] The motivations behind Chia Sung Lien's fears and actions regarding the grandson and the deceased brother could be more explicitly stated for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
