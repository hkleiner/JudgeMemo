Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "But call the coming religious reconstruction what you will, what do names matter when all humanity is crucified, what does anything matter but to save it from meaningless frictions and massacres?"
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "frictions and massacres", "stuff", "dina dimalchutha dina")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the thing" (repeated instances, assuming "thing" refers to an organization or concept that should be clearly defined or preceded by an article for fluency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Lincoln's statement to the broader religious reconstruction and then to the Jewish mission without clear connectors.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential ideas (e.g., the shift from biblical quotes to the discussion of Arthur Davis and then back to the Jewish mission)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity around "the stuff" and "the thing" without provided context, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
