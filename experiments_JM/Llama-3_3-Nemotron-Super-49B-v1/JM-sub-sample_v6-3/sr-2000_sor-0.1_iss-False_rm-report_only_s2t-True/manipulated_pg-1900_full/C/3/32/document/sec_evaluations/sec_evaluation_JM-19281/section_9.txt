Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or highly formal vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "unconstrained") might reduce accessibility for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of Bahá'í teachings and history are made without clear contextualization within the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, with some topics feeling abruptly introduced.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
