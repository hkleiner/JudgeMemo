Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was his daily walk with Eileen, however, which introduced Excalibur to life--life in its broadest and most romantic sense.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "eminence", "anteater's tongue") might require a second read for full comprehension by all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Excalibur's antics to the narrative handoff ("As I was not privileged..."), slightly disrupting the flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of religious service schedules ("Wednesdays we cut it out--omit it and have full Matins at ten") without brief explanation might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
