Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "promiscuous contact", "tactless brutes", "avaricious") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between biographical narrative, descriptive art analysis, and transactional details without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of art world dynamics and historical context (e.g., "the thing", "the stuff") could confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
