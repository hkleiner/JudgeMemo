2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the battle description and the introduction of the "FIVE FORKS" chapter
- [CLARITY] Unclear references ("a thing", "stuff") hinder understanding of locations and plans
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between Lee's situation and Grant's planning in the final paragraphs
