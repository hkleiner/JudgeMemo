Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague placeholder ("a thing") for specific names, causing minor confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentence structures are simple and repetitive, slightly affecting flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] References to "a thing" (e.g., city, bridge, pony) reduce clarity without prior context.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the cruise to mentioning the need to conclude the story.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
