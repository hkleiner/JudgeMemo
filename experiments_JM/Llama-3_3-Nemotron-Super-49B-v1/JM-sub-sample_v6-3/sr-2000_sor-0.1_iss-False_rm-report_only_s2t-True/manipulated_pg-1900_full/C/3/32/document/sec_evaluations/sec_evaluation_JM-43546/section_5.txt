Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "a thing" and "the stuff" used inconsistently, likely placeholders for "Scotland" and "England".
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "the stuff" and "a thing" for country names, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted (e.g., discussions about King Edward and clan tartans).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Queen Mary's palace to the University of the thing's medical school.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge (e.g., "the stuff's novels", "the thing" without clear context for new readers).
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Holyrood Palace visit to planning a future trip to Abbotsford without a clear connector.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
