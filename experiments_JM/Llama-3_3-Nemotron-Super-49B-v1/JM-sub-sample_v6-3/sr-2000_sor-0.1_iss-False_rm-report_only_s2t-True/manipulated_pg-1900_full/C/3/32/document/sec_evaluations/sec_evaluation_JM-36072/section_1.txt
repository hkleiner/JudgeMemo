Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "saeculum mirabile", "epigoni") might require additional effort for less knowledgeable readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between historical periods and ideas could be more explicitly guided for smoother flow.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of historical events (e.g., the impact of the French Revolution on England) might leave some readers disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
