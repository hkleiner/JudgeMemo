Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If then, there is to be a festival, why should it not be the festival of Christmas?").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "insoluble", "fellowship of brothers", "altruistic") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing social justice to justifying Christmas as the ideal festival feels somewhat abrupt and could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between various topics (social justice, faith in goodwill, justification of festivals, and specifics of Christmas customs) without clear transitional phrases, potentially disrupting the flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
