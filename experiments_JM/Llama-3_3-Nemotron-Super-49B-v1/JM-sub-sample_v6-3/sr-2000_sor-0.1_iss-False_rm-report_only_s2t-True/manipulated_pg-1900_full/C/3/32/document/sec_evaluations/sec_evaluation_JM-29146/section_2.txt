Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He felt good about what he'd done. With Stu sick, and with Sally and the kids, he'd done the only thing he could do." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of similar phrases for describing emotions/actions (e.g., "told himself" variations)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "an Earthgirl whose beauty was entirely missed by Chind Ramar" (could imply Chind Ramar's perception rather than an absolute statement, slightly confusing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey's interaction with Englander to the gambling scene without clear transitional phrase
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential thought process in "He still had almost twenty-five credits left. Maybe he really would have a lucky night at the tables. Maybe ... heck, he'd been down-and-out before." (abrupt switch from present to past experiences)
- [CLARITY] Character motivation: The Earthgirl's actions and thoughts, though intriguing, feel somewhat disconnected from the immediate context of the scene

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **3.5**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4**
