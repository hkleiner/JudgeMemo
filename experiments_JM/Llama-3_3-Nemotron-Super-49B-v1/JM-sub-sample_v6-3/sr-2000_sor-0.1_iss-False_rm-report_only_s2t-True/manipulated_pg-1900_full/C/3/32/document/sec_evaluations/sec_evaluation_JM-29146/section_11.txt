Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly abrupt transition from dialogue to narrative ("She had been sleeping. She smiled...") without a clear connector.
- [LEXICON] Word choice "tremulously" might be less common, potentially causing a brief pause for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt conclusion with "THE END" without a narrative lead-in or emotional closure.
- [CLARITY] Assumption that readers infer the depth of Ramsey and Margot's relationship development off-screen.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
