Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "a stuff" (repeated, unclear term, likely a placeholder or error for "Masonic lodge" or similar)
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading flow in some paragraphs
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (assumed typo, frequency suggests systemic error rather than singular typo)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] "a stuff" lacks definition, confusing readers unfamiliar with the context
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and the call to action for the university building project
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the Masonic lodge history and the subsequent chapters without transitional phrases

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
