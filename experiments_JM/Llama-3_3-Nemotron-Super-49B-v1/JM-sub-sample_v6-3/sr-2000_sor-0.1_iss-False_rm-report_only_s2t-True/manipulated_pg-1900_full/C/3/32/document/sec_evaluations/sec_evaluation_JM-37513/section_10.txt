Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Utilization of highly specialized and archaic vocabulary (e.g., "cognita", "re-presentations") could hinder comprehension for non-experts.
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional ambiguous subject-verb agreement in deeply nested sentences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the nature of cognitive relatedness and its effectiveness are stated without clear preceding evidence within this segment.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing psycho-physical parallelism to the complexity of cognitive awareness without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] The analogy between cognitive knowledge and gravitative knowledge, while intriguing, may confuse due to its abstract nature and lack of explicit explanation of its relevance.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
