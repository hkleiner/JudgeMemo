Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "Not more 'matter and energy', but more varied relationships and new properties, quite unpredictable from what one may perhaps speak of as the fire-mist's point of view.")
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "fire-mist", "heteropathic laws", "emergent")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with referenced authors' works without brief context (e.g., Spencer, Mill, Lewes)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing scientific interpretation to introducing the concept of "Source" without clear connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
