Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "And then, in Debby’s low voice there was little left of a stuff’s bravado" (inconsistent verb tense and unclear "stuff's bravado" without context)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or outdated language (e.g., "the stuff", "thou/thee") may hinder modern readability
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., "a stuff’s good heart", missing commas for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional confession to Doctor Bell's sudden interest in her family connections without clear motivation
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from hospital to Washington's office without clear time transitions) may confuse readers
- [CLARITY] Unclear references (e.g., "the stuff", "a thing") without provided context from previous chapters

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
