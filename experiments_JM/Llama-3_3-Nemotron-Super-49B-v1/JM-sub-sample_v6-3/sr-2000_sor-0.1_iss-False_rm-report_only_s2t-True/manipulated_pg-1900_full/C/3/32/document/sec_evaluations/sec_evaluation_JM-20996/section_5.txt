Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "But, expensive though it is, it is very pleasant to live there and those who have once enjoyed it often wish again to quaff the cup of its delights.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "vehiclo", "coupe de main", "tao") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing life in Manila/hamlets and the detailed description of a Filipino sitting-room without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The shift from general life descriptions to specific furniture arrangement in homes could benefit from a smoother thematic connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
