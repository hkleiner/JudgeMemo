Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but "fetters" in a modern context) could slightly hinder readability for all audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between biographical narrative, artistic analysis, and philosophical interpretation without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of art history and specific artworks ("Man with the Hoe", "Breaking the Clod") might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
