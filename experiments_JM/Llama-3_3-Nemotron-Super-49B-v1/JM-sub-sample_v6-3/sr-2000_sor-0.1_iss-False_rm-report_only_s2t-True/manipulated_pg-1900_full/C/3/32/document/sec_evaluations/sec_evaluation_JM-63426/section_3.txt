Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "You tell him you havenâ€™t eaten since the previous night." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of "the thing" (appears to be a placeholder or error, disrupting fluency)
- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "McVickar Theater building" (assuming it's a known location, but without context, it's hard to confirm)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different time periods and topics (e.g., from describing work to the Christmas incident)
- [CLARITY] Unclear context for "the thing" (repeatedly used without explanation)
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of Fred Goudy without prior setup in the evaluated segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
