Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "thickets", "succouring") might require additional interpretation for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about reader's prior knowledge of various religious texts and figures (e.g., Bahá'u'lláh, Micah) without introduction.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing religious unity to critiquing gender roles in sacred texts without a clear connecting statement.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
