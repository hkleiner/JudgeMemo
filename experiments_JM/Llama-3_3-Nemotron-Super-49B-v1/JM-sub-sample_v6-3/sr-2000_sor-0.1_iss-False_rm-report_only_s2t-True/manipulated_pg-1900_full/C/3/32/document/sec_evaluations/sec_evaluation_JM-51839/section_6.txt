1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (repeated, unclear term, likely a placeholder)

- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted (e.g., the paragraph about the Sacred Heart church)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt topic shifts (e.g., from Old Stone Fort to Missions and Presidio without clear connection)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or transitions between distinct historical topics
- [CLARITY] Unclear references ("a thing", "the stuff") disrupt the narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
