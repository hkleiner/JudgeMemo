Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Jim thought quick and hard, with chills and fever coursing over him ad libitum."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in "the mystery of the coming morning, that phase of the day which never ceases to be unreal"
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" (contextually incorrect, should be "ad lib" or rephrased for clarity in this context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from singing to discovering a mountain lion without transitional context
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt change from Jim's introspection to the boy's shout about a cat
- [CLARITY] Unclear why Jim's reaction to the mountain lion involves a "small boy" persona without prior context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
