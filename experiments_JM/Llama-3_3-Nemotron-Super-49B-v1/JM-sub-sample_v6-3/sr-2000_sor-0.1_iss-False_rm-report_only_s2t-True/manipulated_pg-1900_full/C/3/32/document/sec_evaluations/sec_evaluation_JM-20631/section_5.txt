- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "savage sublimity", "Pilpul") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between contrasting ideas (e.g., Judaism vs. Germanism, biblical context vs. modern interpretations) could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] Depth of historical and religious references assumes a high baseline of reader knowledge.
