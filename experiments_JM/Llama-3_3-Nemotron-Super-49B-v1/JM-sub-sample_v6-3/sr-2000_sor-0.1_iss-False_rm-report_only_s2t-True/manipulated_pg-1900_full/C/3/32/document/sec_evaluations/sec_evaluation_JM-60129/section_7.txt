Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or specialized vocabulary (e.g., "tshi", "t'idu", "golma") could hinder understanding for non-specialists.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but non-standard names and terms are numerous.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical context, demographic details, administrative divisions, customs, and marriage practices without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed enumerations (e.g., "bones" list) and specific customs might confuse without a broader contextual framework.
- [LOGIC] Assumes prior knowledge of the subject area, potentially leading to disorientation for uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
