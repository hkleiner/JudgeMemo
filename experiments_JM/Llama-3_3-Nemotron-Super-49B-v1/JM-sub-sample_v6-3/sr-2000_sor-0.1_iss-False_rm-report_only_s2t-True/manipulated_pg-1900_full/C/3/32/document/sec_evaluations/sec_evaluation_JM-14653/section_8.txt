Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "sine qua non", "exasperation", "interminable")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, lengthy sentences requiring re-reading for full comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between philosophical discussion and the final, more practical paragraph about Christmas
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs blend multiple, closely related but distinct ideas without clear segmentation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
