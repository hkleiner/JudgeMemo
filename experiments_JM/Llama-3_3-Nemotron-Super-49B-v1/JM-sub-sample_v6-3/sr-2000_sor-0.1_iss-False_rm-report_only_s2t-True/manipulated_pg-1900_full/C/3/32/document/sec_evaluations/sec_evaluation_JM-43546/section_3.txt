Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "All any one really knows about the game, however, is that it has been played in a thing for a very long time."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary for the apparent target audience (e.g., "staunch", "fash", "couchard's blow") without clear contextualization for clarity.
- [SPELLING/CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent use of "a thing" (likely a placeholder or error, e.g., "one of the four famous a thing", "played in a thing for a very long time").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between descriptive sections (e.g., from Donald's daily life to the explanation of "jiggot" without a clear connector).
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of Scottish culture and terms without sufficient explanation for potential non-Scottish readers (e.g., "kirk", "tewky" explained, but others like "couchard's blow" are not).
- [LOGIC] Unnecessary detail inclusion that disrupts the narrative flow (e.g., extensive description of Newhaven fishwife's attire).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
