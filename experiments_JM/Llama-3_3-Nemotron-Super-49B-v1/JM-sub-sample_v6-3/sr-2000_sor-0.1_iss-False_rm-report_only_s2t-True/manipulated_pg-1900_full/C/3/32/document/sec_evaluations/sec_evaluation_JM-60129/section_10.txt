- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the departure to detailing the landscape without a clear connecting phrase
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about locations (e.g., "the Yögur country") without brief contextualization within the segment
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from geographical description to the arrival at Li-yen without transitional phrases
