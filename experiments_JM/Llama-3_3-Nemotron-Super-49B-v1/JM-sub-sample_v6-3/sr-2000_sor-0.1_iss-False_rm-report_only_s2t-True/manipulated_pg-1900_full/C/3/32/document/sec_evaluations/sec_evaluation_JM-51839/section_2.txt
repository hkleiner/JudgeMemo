Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "a thing" repeatedly used without clear antecedent, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in some paragraphs may hinder smooth reading.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors, but "a stuff" suggests possible typographical error for consistency (e.g., with "a thing").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between historical events without clear chronological connectors.
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or transitional phrases between distinct historical periods.
- [CLARITY] Overuse of "a thing" and "a stuff" without immediate context hampers understanding.
