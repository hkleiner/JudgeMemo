Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It was a fine autumn day, and there are not too many such days in the stuff; for it is a rainy little country..." (inconsistent subject-verb agreement and unclear "the stuff" reference)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "the stuff" without clear explanation
- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "tewky" (likely "teewky" or another term, though contextually understandable)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained shift from describing Scotland to focusing on Sandy's package without clear connection
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the train ride to the birthday celebration without a smooth link
- [LOGIC] Unclear timeline and spacing between events (e.g., from train arrival to the next morning's celebration)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
