Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "But the accompaniments of the feast are also excessive...") may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "sirocco", "rejuvenators") might require additional cognitive effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between defending feasting and introducing the idea of revitalizing the festival could be more seamless.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the sceptic's questions to imagining an alternative festival feels somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
