Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The culmination of the alliance had waited but the year to be set by the contracting families as the eighteenth spring of Kuei Pingâ€™s life.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require additional context for full understanding (e.g., "soothsayers", "cyclic animals", "black and yellow days")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Kuei Ping with pearls to her wedding day) without clear transitional markers
- [CLARITY] Assumed cultural/historical context (e.g., astrological marriage practices) might confuse readers without background knowledge

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
