Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is astonishing the high value the French place upon the life of a mere woman.")
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "taubes", "poilus", "réformé") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the station scene to the War Office narrative without a clear connecting phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between personal experience, reflection, and future plans without a smooth flow, potentially causing slight disorientation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
