Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I had worked in Ishpeming and Chicago so as to earn money to take me back to Boston...") 
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "deckle-edge", "fly-specked") may hinder readability for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (not pervasive but noticeable in transitions between paragraphs)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., abrupt shift from discussing typefaces to the Wayside Press's location) 
- [CLARITY] Overuse of vague terms ("a thing", "the stuff") without clear reference, confusing the reader
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between some paragraphs (e.g., from aesthetic awakening to the Wayside Press's naming reason)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
