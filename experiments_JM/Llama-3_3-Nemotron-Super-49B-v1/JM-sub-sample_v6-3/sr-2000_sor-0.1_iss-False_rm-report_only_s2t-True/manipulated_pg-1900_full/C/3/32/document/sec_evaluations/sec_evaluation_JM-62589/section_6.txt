Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "What were his hopes and sorrows now?" (feels out of place)
- [LEXICON] Overly dramatic language in "an awful agony took possession of his last conscious thought" (may detract from fluency for some readers)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "a drop more" (informal, but noticeable in formal text)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Robert's exhaustion to detailed conversation without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt scene change from the group's apprehension to Shirtliffe's solo ride without bridging paragraph
- [CLARITY] Unclear timeline between Robert's arrival and the volley of distant firing

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
