Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "This letter betrays itself as one of the earliest written for Tushratta by the fact that it makes no request for gold."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may impede smooth reading for non-specialists (e.g., "proclaiming to tell", "notwithstanding")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "a thing" (should be "the thing" for clarity, though context may imply a title)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Tushratta's letters to introducing Nimmuria's end and the accession of Akhenaten
- [CLARITY] Assuming prior knowledge of historical figures and their relationships without clear introduction
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear linking between the excerpted letters and the broader narrative arc

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
