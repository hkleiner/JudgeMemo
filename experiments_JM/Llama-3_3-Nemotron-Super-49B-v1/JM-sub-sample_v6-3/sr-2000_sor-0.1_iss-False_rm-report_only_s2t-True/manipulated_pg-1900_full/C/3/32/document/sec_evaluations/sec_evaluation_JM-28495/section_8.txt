Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward sentence structure in "This was true enough, except that when Eileen said 'in' she meant 'up.'" (could be smoother)
- [LEXICON] Word choice "thing" for the dog (initially) might seem odd before introduction as "Excalibur"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing the tramp's departure to Excalibur's immediate sleep without a transitional phrase
- [CLARITY] Brief ambiguity around "a thing" before it's clarified as the dog

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
