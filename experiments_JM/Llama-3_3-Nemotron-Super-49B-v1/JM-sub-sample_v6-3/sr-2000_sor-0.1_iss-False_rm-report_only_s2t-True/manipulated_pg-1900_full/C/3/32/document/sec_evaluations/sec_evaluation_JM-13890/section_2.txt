Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] "stuff" used repeatedly without definition or context, causing confusion.
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures in paragraphs 5-7 may impede smooth reading.
- [SPELLING] "sultry" (contextually questionable, though not a spelling error, it's an odd choice) and potential typos (e.g., "archÃ¦ologists").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and architectural analysis (paragraphs 6-8).
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression of time within the segment (e.g., jumping from 597 to 1011 without clear sectioning).
- [CLARITY] Overuse of "the thing" without clear reference hinders understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
