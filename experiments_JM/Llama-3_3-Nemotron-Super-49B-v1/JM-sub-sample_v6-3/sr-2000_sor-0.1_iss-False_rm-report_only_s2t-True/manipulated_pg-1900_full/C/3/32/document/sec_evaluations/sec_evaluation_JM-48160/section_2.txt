Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "As I am more susceptible to manners than to anything in the world...").
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "mitrailleuses", "taubes") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the Mayor's experience to the narrator's summons to the Minist√®re de la Guerre.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the stuff" and its context in '70, potentially confusing without additional background.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
