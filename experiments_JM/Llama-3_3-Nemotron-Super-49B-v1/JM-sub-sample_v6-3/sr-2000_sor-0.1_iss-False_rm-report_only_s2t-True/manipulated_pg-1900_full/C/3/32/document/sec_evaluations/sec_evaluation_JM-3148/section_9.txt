- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", "nunky") might reduce readability for modern audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Lyddy's prayer to the description of Anthony's senses without a clear connecting element.
- [CLARITY] Aunt Hitty Tarbox's dialogue, while character-revealing, slightly disrupts the narrative flow with its lengthy, gossip-oriented content.
