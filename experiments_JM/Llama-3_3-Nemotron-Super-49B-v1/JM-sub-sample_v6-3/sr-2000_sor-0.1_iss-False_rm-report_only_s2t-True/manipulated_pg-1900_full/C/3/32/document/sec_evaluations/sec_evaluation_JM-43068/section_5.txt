Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "endeavour", "stuffs", "defunct magistrate") might slightly hinder readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's struggles to introducing his wives without clear contextual connection.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the 1848 revolution, while providing context, feels somewhat tangential to Millet's personal narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
