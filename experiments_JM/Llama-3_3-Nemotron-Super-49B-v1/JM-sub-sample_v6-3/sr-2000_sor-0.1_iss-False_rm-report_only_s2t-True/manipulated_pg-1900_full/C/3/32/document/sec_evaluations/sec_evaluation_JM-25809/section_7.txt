Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was as if the dirt were very soft, and not the striker very strong.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bime-by", "dat's", "yer") might require additional processing for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the intense tunnel work description to the serene evening and hunting trip scenes without a clear narrative bridge
- [CLARITY] The shift in Jim's hunting approach (from shooting to catching) could be more smoothly justified or foreshadowed

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
