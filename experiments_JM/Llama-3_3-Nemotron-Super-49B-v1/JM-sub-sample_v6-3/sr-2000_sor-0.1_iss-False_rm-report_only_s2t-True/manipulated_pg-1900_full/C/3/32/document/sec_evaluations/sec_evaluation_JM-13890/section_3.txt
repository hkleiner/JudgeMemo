Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "a thing" (repeated, unclear reference)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague placeholder "a thing" (lacks specificity)
- [SPELLING] Potential typo in "sumpter-mule's" (assuming "sumpter" is correct, otherwise "sumpter" could be a typo)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from architectural description to Becket's murder story
- [CLARITY] Unclear timeline connections between events (e.g., between Canterbury's development and Becket's return)
- [LOGIC] Assumption of prior knowledge about "the thing" and its context without clear introduction in the evaluated segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
