Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, lengthy sentences may impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Some domain-specific or less common terms (e.g., "kutas", "ta jen") might require additional context for full understanding.
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected within the provided segment.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps between various aspects of Yögur life (marriage, childbirth, physical appearance, intellect, costume, hygiene, etc.) without clear transitional links.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about prior knowledge of comparative groups (e.g., Sarö Yögurs, Kalmucks, Mongolians) might confuse readers unfamiliar with these references.
- [LOGIC] No logical inconsistencies detected, but the broad topic range could make the narrative feel disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
