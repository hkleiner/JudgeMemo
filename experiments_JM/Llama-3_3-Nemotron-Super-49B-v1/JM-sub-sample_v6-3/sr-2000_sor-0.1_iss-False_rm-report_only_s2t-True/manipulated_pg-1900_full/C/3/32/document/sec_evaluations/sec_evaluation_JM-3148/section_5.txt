Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage (e.g., "was" and "had" in close proximity without clear temporal distinction)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary for general readability (e.g., "unexpended feeling", "susceptibilities cherished")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally convoluted sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph describing Lyddy's past)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected shift from funeral planning to Lyddy's backstory without a clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow can be disorienting for the reader
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long or contain too many embedded clauses, reducing clarity

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
