Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "thing" (repeatedly used, unclear what "thing" refers to, e.g., "the thing precincts", "a thing and Trinity Chapel")
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph starting with "Armed even with such brief information")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or unclear terms without explanation (e.g., "lierne vaulting", "corona" or "semicircular extension" without context for general readers)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between describing different parts of the Cathedral (e.g., jumping from the infirmary to the treasury without clear connection)
- [LOGIC] Assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., "the historic murder", "the stuff times" without clear reference or explanation within the segment)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from discussing the Cathedral's layout to philosophizing about ordered beauty)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
