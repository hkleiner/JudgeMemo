Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally awkward sentence structures (e.g., "He had come into the world a naked, starving human soul; he longed to clothe himself, and he was hungry and ever hungrier for knowledge;")
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or overly formal for modern reading tastes (e.g., "degraded", "palpitating mysteries", "vagrant gaze")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from descriptive narrative to Anthony Croft's backstory without clear connecting device
- [CLARITY] Minor ambiguity in the narrative's focus shift between Davy, Uncle Tony, and Anthony Croft's past

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
