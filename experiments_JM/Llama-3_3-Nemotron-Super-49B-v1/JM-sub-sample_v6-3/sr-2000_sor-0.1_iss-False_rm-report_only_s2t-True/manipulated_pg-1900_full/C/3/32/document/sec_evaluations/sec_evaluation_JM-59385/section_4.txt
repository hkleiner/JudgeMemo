Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Feeling the first stirring of a new life entrusted to her, she was filled with joy...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or culturally specific terms (e.g., "hutung", "mandarin robe", "tiger caps") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative progression in some sections (e.g., the jump from Kuei Ping's thoughts on bearing a son to her earlier school teachings).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the emotional intensity of Kuei Ping's desire to leave with Fuh Tang to the more mundane, yet detailed, preparation for the child.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
