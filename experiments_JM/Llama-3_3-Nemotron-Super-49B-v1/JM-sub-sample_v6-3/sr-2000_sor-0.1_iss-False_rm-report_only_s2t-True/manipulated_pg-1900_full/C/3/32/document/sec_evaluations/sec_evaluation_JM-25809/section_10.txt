Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and complex, potentially disrupting flow (e.g., "It was like the rush of a fire-engine, plus twice the speed, and twenty times the danger.")
- [LEXICON] Informal language and slang (e.g., "Hell-a-whooping", "cuss") may affect readability for some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Occasional lack of commas in dialogue tags could improve clarity (e.g., "You're welcome boys" he cried)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Bud's emotional moment to the miners' joking (slight disconnect)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about mining procedures (e.g., "timber" without explanation)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
