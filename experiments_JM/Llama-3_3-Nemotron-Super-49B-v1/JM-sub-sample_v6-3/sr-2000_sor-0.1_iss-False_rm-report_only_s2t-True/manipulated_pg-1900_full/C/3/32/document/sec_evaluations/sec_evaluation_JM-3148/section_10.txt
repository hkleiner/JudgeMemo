Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "rose-coloured dreams", "sweet gravity and consecration of thought") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., "If God had smitten these two with one hand, he had held out the other in tender benediction.") could slightly impede smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from describing Anthony's music composition method to the serene orchard scene with Davy and Lyddy could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The depth of emotional and poetic interpretations (e.g., Lyddy's explanation of the music) might confuse readers not fully immersed in the narrative's emotional context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
