Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in several paragraphs (e.g., "What has not changed...").
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "inescapable requirement", "simmering resentments").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and context without clear introduction in this segment.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing global integration effects to the role of religions in spiritual development without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
