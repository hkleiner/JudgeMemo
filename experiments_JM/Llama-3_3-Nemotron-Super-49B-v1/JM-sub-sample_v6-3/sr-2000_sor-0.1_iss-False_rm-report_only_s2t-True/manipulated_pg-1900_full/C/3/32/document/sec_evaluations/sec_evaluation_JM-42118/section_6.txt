Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It was to be a deluge indeed--scarlet red.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "thou", "thee", "whilst")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles ("a thing" instead of "a person" or specific noun)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from discussing Boucher's death to the political downfall of Choiseul without clear transitional phrase
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Fragonard's career peak to the royal family's fate without smooth connection)
- [CLARITY] Overuse of pronoun "a thing" / "the stuff" without clear antecedent, causing confusion

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
