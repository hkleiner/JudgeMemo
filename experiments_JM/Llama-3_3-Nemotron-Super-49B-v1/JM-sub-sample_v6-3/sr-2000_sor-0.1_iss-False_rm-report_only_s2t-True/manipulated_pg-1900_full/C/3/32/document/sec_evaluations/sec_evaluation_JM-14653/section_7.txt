Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasionally archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "effervescent faith", "inmost constitution") might require additional cognitive effort.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between criticizing the pursuit of unattainable ideals and embracing the inherent value of striving could be more explicitly connected.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter jumps between philosophical reflection, hypothetical scenarios, and broader life lessons without clear transitional markers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
