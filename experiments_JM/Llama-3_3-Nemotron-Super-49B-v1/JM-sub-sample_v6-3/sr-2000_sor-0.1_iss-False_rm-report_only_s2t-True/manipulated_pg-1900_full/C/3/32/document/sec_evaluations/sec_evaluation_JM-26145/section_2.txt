1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "suzerain", "baksh√¨sh") might require additional effort for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (religious reform, political structure, tribal migrations) without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are densely packed with names and events, potentially confusing without prior context.
