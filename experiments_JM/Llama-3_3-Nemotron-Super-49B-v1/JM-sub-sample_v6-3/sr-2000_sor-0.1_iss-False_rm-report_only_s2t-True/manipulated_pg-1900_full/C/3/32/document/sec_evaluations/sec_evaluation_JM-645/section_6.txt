Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If Corvick had broken down I should never know; no one would be of any use if _he_ wasnâ€™t.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require a second read for full comprehension (e.g., "out-Herod", "priggishness")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Corvick's assignment to deeply personal reflections on the narrator's curiosity without a clear transitional link.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different time frames (e.g., past reflections, the current telegram event) without explicit transitional markers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
