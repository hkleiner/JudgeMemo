Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If I was forced to complain...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could be more precise for modern readers (e.g., "stuff earthquake" likely means "a severe earthquake").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between personal anecdotes, observations of war efforts, and philosophical reflections without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about shared knowledge (e.g., "the stuff earthquake") and unnamed locations ("the stuff") might confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
