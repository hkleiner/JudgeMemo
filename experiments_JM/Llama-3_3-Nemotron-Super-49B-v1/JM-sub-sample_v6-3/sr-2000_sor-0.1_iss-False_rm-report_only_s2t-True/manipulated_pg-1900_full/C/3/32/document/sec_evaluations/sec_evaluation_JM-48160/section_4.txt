Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is not my purpose to describe the hospitals here...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices could enhance vividness for modern readers (e.g., "taube" without immediate context).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from hospital description to driving within the city limits without a clear connector.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", "taube") without brief explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
