Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "arcanic", "quasi-biological") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between personal anecdote, philosophical explanation, and academic critique without clear transitional markers.
- [CLARITY] Assumed background knowledge of Spencer's works and 19th-century scientific context may leave some readers disconnected.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
