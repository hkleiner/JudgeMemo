Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutung", "dowry pearls") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between introspective moments, descriptive scenes, and future timelines, which might slightly disrupt the flow for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between the Feast of Lanterns scene and the reflection on years to come could be smoother.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
