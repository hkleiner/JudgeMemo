Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It may be said that unification can only be reached by digging down to some ubiquitous type of relation which is common to all processes throughout the universe at any stage of evolution.")
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ex hypothesi", "superorganic")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional comma splices and lack of clarity in long sentences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from discussing Spencer's work to introducing the concept of "Source" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear progression of ideas, making it hard to follow the author's main point
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient concrete examples to aid understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
