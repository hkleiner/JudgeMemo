Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was not much help, but it was a diversion.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "tur'ble", "smeller") might require additional processing for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from hunting with a rifle to attempting to catch a deer by hand feels somewhat abrupt without clearer motivation
- [CLARITY] The transition from the hunting trip description to the reflective "A good incident is an opal..." could be smoother

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
