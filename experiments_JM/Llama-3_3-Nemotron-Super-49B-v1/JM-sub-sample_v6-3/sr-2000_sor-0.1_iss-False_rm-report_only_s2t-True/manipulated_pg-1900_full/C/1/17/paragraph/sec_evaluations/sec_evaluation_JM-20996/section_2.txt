Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some instances.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "petulantly", "incessant") might slow some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Manila's life to the notice about supplies and then to a dramatic quote without clear connection.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the "Ghost" quote seems unrelated to the surrounding narrative, disrupting coherence.
