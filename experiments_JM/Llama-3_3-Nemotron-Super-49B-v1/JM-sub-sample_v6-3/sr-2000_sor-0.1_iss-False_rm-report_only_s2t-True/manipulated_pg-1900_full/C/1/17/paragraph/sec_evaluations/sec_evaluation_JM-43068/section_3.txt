Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "These expressions are not applicable to any other condition than those which called them forth...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "savouring", "stevest") might require additional effort for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing art movements to Millet's personal life without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of certain artists (e.g., Rousseau, Corot) and art movements without brief contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
