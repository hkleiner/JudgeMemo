Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The mail-rider drew out paper and tobacco, and rolled a cigarette. It was his method of biting his hand."
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("scart", "turdle", "cuddent") may affect readability for some audiences
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles in some sentences (e.g., "der tunnel's fell in")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from emotional rescue scene to philosophical text about God (seems out of context and disrupts flow)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ches and Bud's conversation to introducing Captain Hanrahan's party without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex or wordy, slightly obscuring the immediate understanding of the action

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
