Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "kinsman", "dandified", "Rabelaisian") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's artistic development to the description of the bride's dowry and the political scenario (last two paragraphs seem disconnected from the preceding narrative).
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between Fragonard's biography, historical events, and unrelated customs (e.g., the wedding custom description) without clear thematic or chronological connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
