Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was the knowledge that Anne, the boy, and all he wished to do for both depended on the pay-streak which had urged him to such a fury of effort.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common terms might reduce readability for all audiences (e.g., "yaller bone-heap", "sojering")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few instances (not prominently disruptive)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Bud's mail route story to Jim's reverie feels somewhat abrupt without clearer transitional context.
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter's ending scene, while emotionally impactful, transitions quickly from dialogue-heavy narrative to solo character crisis without a bridging paragraph.
- [CLARITY] Ches's immediate realization of being alone and the weight of his responsibility could be more explicitly stated for instant clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
