Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "Out of the first difficulty a dozen others had arisen, till the suzerain seized upon his dues by force, yet without leaving peace behind him."
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms ("suzerain", "baksh√¨sh") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing school activities to the "CHAPTER: THE JANITOR--HIS RELATION TO THE SCHOOL" without clear connection.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the historical/administrative anecdote ("Resistance to it was so surely...") seems unrelated to the surrounding discussion on school activities.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing school activities to a completely unrelated story about a manufacturing establishment, disrupting coherence.
- [CLARITY] The purpose of including the manufacturing establishment story is unclear in the context of the rest of the text.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
