Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and descriptive passage (e.g., shift from Debby/Jack to Egyptian king context without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "matrimonial alliances", "exquisitely molded") contrasting with more colloquial dialogue
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "I've taught you to read" followed by "I've brought you the news" in different narrative contexts)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected insertion of historical/anthropological text about Egyptian kings
- [LOGIC] Unexplained shift in scene from Debby's decision to join the army to the introduction of "Robert Shirtliffe" without clear narrative link
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between chapters (CHAPTER IV introduction feels abrupt)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
