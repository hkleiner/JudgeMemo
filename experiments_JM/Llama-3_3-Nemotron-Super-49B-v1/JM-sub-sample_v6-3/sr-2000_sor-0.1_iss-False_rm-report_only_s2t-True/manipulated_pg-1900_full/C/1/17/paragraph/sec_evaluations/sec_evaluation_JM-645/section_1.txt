Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "All the houses I visited..." and preceding context, disrupting flow.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some phrases (e.g., "void of angles", "surreptitious hand") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift in scene/topic from Vereker's review to "houses in Chinese style" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the purpose/narrative significance of the "houses" paragraph, potentially confusing the reader.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
