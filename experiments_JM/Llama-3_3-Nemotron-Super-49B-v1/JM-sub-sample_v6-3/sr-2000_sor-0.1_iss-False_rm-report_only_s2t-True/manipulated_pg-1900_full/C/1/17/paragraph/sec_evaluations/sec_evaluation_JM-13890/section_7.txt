Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "thuriff", "desultory", "fascinatingly") might slow some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the cathedral to discussing the walled city and its history.
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events (e.g., Queen Bertha, Ethelbert) without brief context for potentially uninformed readers.
