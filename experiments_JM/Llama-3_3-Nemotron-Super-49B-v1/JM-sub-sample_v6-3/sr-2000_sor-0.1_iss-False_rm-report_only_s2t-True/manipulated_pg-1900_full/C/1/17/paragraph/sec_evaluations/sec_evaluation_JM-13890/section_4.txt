Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical and philosophical sections (e.g., "Emboldened by the breakdown...") 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "savage murder", "supernatural sanctions", "perpendicular style")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., transitioning from Becket's murder to philosophical musings and back to historical events)
- [CLARITY] Assuming reader's prior knowledge of historical context (e.g., "the new creed", "the Papal legate at Avranches" without brief explanation)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between distinct historical events and their broader implications

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
