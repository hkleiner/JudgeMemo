Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some outdated expressions (e.g., "impresario") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing board interactions to introducing "CHAPTER: SCHOOL ACTIVITIES" without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The quote from the Seattle high school principal feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative without explicit integration.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
