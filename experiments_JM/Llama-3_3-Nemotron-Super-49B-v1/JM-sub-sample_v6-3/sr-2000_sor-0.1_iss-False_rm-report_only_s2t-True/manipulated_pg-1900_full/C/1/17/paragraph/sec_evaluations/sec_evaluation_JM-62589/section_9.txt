Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact that it was still his mission, the mission of a Chosen People." (appears out of context)
- [LEXICON] Informal dialogue tags (e.g., "Morley laughed the old scornful laugh") could be more nuanced for historical context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "I trusted you once" to "you played me")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Robert's escape to the philosophical statement about Israel's mission (disrupts narrative flow)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling within the segment (flashbacks and present actions) could be smoother
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (especially Morley's sudden depth) could be more clearly established within the segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
