Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph describing the snowstorm)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "shoddy", "galley", "thimbrel") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
- [SPELLING] No apparent spelling errors detected in the provided segment

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between vastly different scenes (e.g., from the boss's home to the printing plant, to religious references, to future career developments) without clear narrative bridges
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs assume specific historical or contextual knowledge (e.g., "Kate Claxton in the Two Orphans", specific artist names) that might confuse unfamiliar readers
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the biblical and historical violence references seems disconnected from the rest of the narrative's focus on the protagonist's life and career

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
