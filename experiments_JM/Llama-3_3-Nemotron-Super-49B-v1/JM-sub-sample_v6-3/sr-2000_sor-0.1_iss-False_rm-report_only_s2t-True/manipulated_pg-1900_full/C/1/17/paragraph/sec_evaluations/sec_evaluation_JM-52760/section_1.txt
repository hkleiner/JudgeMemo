Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense sentence structures (e.g., "Strategically, despite the stalemate in Virginia, the beginning of 1864 found the Northern armies in a stronger position than the Confederate military forces.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "laid heavily", "turned back")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the war's broader strategy to a detailed description of the aristocracy (seems out of context)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about specific locations and their strategic importance without brief explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
