Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was this noble ambition...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "lumbering and trammelled flight", "rudy of complexion") might slow reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic principle to his birth and early life without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The anecdote's connection to the overall narrative theme, while implied, could be more explicitly stated for stronger coherence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
