Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and the phrase "As for the capitaineâ€”but what matters? "
- [LEXICON] Use of "etc. &c." may cause slight confusion for some readers due to its antiquated nature.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "Warlike expeditions among the vassal chiefs were the order of the day." (Could imply a broader time frame than intended, slightly affecting clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of "the capitaine" disrupts the historical coherence.
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear connection between the detailed historical accounts and the final, disconnected sentence about Adolphe Bauche.
- [TRANSITION] Missing transitional elements between the letter excerpts and the analysis of vassal chiefs' activities.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
