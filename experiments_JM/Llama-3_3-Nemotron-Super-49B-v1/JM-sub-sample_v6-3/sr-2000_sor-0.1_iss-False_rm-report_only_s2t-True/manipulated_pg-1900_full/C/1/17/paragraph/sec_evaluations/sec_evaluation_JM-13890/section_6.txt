Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical and descriptive paragraphs (e.g., shift from Cathedral description to Grant's objective)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "lierne vaulting", "reticulated stonework")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "is" and "were" in close proximity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and thematic jumps (e.g., switching between Cathedral architecture, historical figures, and unrelated events like Grant's objective)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between distinct topics (e.g., no transitional phrases between paragraphs on different subjects)
- [LOGIC] Inclusion of seemingly unrelated content (e.g., the paragraph about Grant and Lee disrupts the Cathedral's descriptive flow)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
