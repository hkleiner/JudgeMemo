Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "In any such integrated system the part implies the whole--which, by the way, is quite a different matter from saying that the part includes the whole...") 
- [LEXICON] Use of highly specialized vocabulary without clear explanation (e.g., "effective relatedness", "epiphenomenal accompaniment")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between philosophical discussion and biographical note on Spencer (e.g., shift from cognitive relatedness to "The lamas living in this monastery...") 
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient contextualization for clarity (e.g., "the locus of awareness in just the same sense as I might speak of the earth as a locus of gravitative knowledge")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
