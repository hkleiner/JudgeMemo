Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "intractable", "condign", "draconian") might require additional interpretation for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Transitions between discussing different religious texts and historical examples could be smoother.
- [CLARITY] The shift from philosophical discussion to specific historical/cultural critiques (e.g., women's status) feels somewhat abrupt without clearer thematic bridging.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
