- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "flaneurs") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the Union's strategic plans to the detailed story of Sir Joshua Reynolds without clear contextual connection.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the Sir Joshua Reynolds paragraph seems unrelated to the surrounding military strategy and events, disrupting the narrative flow.
