Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between the quote "My gosh, Ramsey!..." and the subsequent paragraph about Rosa Bonheur's artwork.
- [LEXICON] Overly formal and less common vocabulary (e.g., "inmost fibre", "saluting the rising orb of day") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the artist accompanied her beloved invalid to the land of sunshine" could imply the artist was the invalid, slight rewording for clarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected shift from discussing Rosa Bonheur's response to the war to analyzing her artwork's qualities without a clear linking sentence.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between paragraphs, especially when moving from biographical events to art critiques.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the paragraph starting with "The most obvious cause of these re-evaluations..." seems entirely out of context and disrupts the coherence of the biographical narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
