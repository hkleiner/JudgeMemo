Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee" not present but "entreating" might be less common) could slightly hinder modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's life to describing the Carlsbad Caverns (seems out of context).
- [LOGIC] The narrative assumes prior knowledge of all referenced artworks and historical figures without introduction.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
