Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from war context to art history without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "oeuvre", "Réformé Numero II") may hinder smooth reading for non-specialist readers
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of ellipses (...) without clear necessity in some transitions

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential topic shifts (war, art, society, back to war efforts) disrupt overall narrative flow
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge in some references (e.g., "the Low Countries", "Rubens' appeal") without brief explanation for general readers
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear thematic connection between the described events and the main narrative thread

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
