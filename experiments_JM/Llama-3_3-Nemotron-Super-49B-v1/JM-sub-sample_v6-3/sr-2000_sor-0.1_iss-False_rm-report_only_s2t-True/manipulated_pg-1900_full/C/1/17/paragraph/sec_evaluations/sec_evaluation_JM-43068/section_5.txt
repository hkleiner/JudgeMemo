Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical context (e.g., 1848 revolution) and descriptive passages (e.g., Millet's life in Barbizon).
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "strenuous existence", "sympathetic disposition").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past simple and past perfect without clear narrative justification).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from Millet's struggles to a descriptive piece on Yögurs, then back to Millet).
- [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of the Yögurs' description to Millet's biography, disrupting narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially when shifting topics (e.g., from art style comparisons to living arrangements).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
