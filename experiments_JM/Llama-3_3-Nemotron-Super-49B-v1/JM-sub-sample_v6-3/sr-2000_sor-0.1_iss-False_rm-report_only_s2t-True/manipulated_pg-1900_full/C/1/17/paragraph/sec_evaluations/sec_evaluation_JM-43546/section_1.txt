Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures in descriptive paragraphs (e.g., "Of the historic and scenic charms...") may slow reading flow.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bairn", "wee") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Scottish culture in the Preface to the story of "Rob Roy" without a clear narrative bridge.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the puppy's discovery, family discussion, and cultural descriptions (e.g., Scottish tea) without a smooth thematic connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
