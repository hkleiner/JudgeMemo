Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from Reynolds to Mescaleros farming)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "transmuting", "patrimony")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford comma in some sentences)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential timeline within the segment (jumps between different time periods)
- [LOGIC] Tangential information (Mescaleros farming paragraph seems unrelated to the main topic)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events without introduction

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
