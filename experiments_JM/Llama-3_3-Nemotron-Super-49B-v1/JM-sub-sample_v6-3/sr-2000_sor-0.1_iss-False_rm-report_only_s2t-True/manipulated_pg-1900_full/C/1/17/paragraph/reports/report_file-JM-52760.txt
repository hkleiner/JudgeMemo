        • Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "laid heavily", "turned back")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from discussing the war's broader strategy to a detailed description of the aristocracy (seems out of context)

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:

    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from describing Petersburg's importance to the start of the Battle of Petersburg without a clear linking sentence.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of specific roads and railroads without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The narrative jumps between different time frames (e.g., from the 1860 census to the 1862 Peninsular Campaign to 1864 events) without clear chronological markers for readers not deeply familiar with the timeline.
