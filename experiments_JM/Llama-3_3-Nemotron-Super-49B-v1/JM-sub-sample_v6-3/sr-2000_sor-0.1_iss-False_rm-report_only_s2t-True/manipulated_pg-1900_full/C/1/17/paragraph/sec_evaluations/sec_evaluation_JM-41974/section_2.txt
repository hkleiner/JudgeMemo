Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary may hinder readability for non-expert readers (e.g., "ennobled", "disinterestedness", "mettlesome")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., "If he wished to paint a Last Supper, it mattered little to him...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's art style to his personal life and friendships
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about some historical figures and events without brief context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
