Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for non-expert readers.
- [LEXICON] Utilization of highly specialized philosophical vocabulary (e.g., "noumenal Cause", "interpenetrating whole of reality") could hinder comprehension for general audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt shift from discussing Spencer and Bergson's philosophies to the artist's works (e.g., "Diana leaving the Bath") disrupts the logical flow of philosophical discussion.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between paragraphs discussing different aspects of Spencer's philosophy and critiques thereof.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
