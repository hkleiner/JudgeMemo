Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Laws of social interaction...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "na√Øvely", "reliably", "inconsequential") might require a second read for full comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's artworks to a philosophical tangent ("Laws of social interaction...") without clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about some historical figures/artistic elements without brief contextualization (e.g., the significance of "the Eternal City" could be clarified for non-experts).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
