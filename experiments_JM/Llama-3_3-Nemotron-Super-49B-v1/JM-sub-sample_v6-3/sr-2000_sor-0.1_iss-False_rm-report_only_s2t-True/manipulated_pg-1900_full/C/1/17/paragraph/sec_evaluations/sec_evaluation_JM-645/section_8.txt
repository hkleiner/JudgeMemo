Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I candidly admit indeed that at the time—for I heard from her repeatedly—I read some singular things into Gwendolen’s words and some still more extraordinary ones into her silences.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "avidity", "touvaille", "connoisseur")
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs without clear section breaks

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about characters' intentions without clear textual evidence (e.g., interpreting Gwendolen's silence)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Corvick's death to the narrator's speculation about Vereker's secret
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "the idol" without immediate context for new readers)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
