Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "raked by a vicious crossfire") might challenge some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The abrupt transition from discussing the Battle of Five Forks to the chapter on the Fall of Petersburg and Richmond could be smoother.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different events and locations (e.g., from Five Forks to Petersburg/Richmond) without clear transitional phrases.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
