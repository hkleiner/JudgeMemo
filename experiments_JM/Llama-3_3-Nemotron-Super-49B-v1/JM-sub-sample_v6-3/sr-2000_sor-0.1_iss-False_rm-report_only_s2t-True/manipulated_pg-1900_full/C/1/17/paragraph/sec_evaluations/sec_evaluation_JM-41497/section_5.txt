Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "unpretentious monograph", "rank and file of British students") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Reynolds' artistic development to a historical military event ("The western end of Leeâ€™s mobile defenses had crumbled.") that seems unrelated to the rest of the segment.
- [CLARITY] Assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of artists (e.g., Mengs, Gandy) and historical context without brief elaboration.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
