Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between Vardin's excitement and the technical explanation of hyper-space (disrupts flow)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "extension sans duration") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few sentences (e.g., switching between past and present in dialogue descriptions)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from space travel preparations to Cousin Margaret's unrelated statement about gingersnaps (severely disrupts coherence)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential introduction of ideas (e.g., proto-man's secret, hyper-space mechanics) without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in Margot's thoughts on proto-man and time, lacking clear resolution or connection to the immediate plot

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
