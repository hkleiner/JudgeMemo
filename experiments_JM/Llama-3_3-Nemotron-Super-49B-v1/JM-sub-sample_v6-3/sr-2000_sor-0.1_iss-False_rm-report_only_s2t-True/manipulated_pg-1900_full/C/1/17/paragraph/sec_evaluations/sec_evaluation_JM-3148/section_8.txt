Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "It is these saving stars that light the eternal darkness of the blind.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "akimbo", "sapolio") might require pause for less familiar readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Anthony's thoughts to the detailed description of Lyddy's sitting-room without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some assumptions about character backgrounds and relationships (e.g., Davy's talent, Mrs. Buck's habits) without prior context in the provided segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
