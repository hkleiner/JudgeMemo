Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Tennyson to military operations without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-specialists (e.g., "pernicious habit", "sentimental brutalism")
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear linking between some sentences within paragraphs

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced historical figures and events without introduction
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and thematic jumps (e.g., from literature to military history to social critique)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs convey multiple, loosely connected ideas

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
