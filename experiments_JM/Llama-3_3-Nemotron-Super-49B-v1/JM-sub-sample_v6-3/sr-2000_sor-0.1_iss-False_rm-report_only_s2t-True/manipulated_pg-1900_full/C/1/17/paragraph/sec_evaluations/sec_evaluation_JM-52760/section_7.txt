Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt shift from historical narrative to unrelated romantic ("Mildred...") and philosophical ("Consider the past...") segments without transition.
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent tone: formal (historical) vs. informal (romantic) vs. poetic (philosophical).
- [GRAMMAR] Missing contextualization for sudden character introductions (e.g., "Mildred", "Angelo").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Illogical narrative jump from the battle description to unrelated scenes without a connecting narrative thread.
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or signaling for genre/topic shifts (historical battle, romance, philosophy).
- [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of "Mildred" and "Consider the past" sections to the preceding historical context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
