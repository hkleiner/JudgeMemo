Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence, and she was bound out to Mrs. Lane like a slave; she, proud, free Debby Mason!")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("lass", "thou", "thee") might reduce readability for modern readers without historical context
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense ("had been ordered" to "was to go") in the same paragraph, though not severely distracting

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's emotional outburst to the description of her life in Mrs. Lane's house without a clear connecting sentence
- [CLARITY] The shift in timeline ("During the year which dragged drearily away...") could be more smoothly integrated
- [TRANSITION] The memory of Debby's mother feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative without a stronger contextual link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
