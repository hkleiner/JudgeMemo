Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "I saw it ahead, and Corvick saw that I saw it.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "perturbation", "divergence", "supersubtlety") might require a second read for full comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor disconnect between the detailed historical reference (Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road) and the surrounding narrative flow, feeling somewhat tangential
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the conversation with Vereker to the historical battle description without clear contextual linking

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
