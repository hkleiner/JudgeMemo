Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and personal dialogue (e.g., shift from Reynolds' painting to Shirtliffe's scene)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some dialogue ("I'd rather like to help Debby") feels slightly anachronistic or inconsistent with character voice
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had expired" to "had not been loyal enough" could be smoother)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift from the historical/biographical section to the fictional narrative without clear contextual bridge
- [LOGIC] Character motivations (e.g., Robert's sole desire to find Morley) could be more deeply contextualized within this segment for immediate clarity
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal or spatial transition between scenes (e.g., from the camp to the frozen stream)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
