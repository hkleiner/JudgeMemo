Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "a going concern", "vulgar language") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Reynolds' character to the broader societal progress without a clear connecting phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative flow (jumping between biography, historical context, and artistic influences) could confuse some readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
