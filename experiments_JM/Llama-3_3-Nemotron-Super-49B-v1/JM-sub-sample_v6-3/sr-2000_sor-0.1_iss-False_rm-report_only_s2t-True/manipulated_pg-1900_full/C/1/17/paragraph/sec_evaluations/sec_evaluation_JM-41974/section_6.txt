Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., "Throughout his life...") may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "pompous", "virile") might require a second read for full comprehension by non-expert readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's work to the sentence about Tennyson, disrupting the narrative flow.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph's assertion about Veronese's place in art history feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding detailed biography.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
