Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "But to say this is not to make the mission false...")

- [GRAMMAR] Occasional comma splices and run-on sentences (e.g., "The Covenant of Israel... no more objective reality...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing British imperialism to childbirth customs (no clear connection) 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential ideas (e.g., jumping from Kipling to childbirth practices to biblical references without clear links) 
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient explanation for general understanding (e.g., "volitional verities")
