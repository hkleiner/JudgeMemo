Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "If the firmness of the Allies held back the Germans at Ypres and prevented them from breaking through to Calais, the Russian Army also played an important part in this strategic situation--compelling the Germans to abandon the operation at Ypres much earlier than the Germans and Falkenhayn had figured.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of similar phrases for the same concept (e.g., "at the end of 1914", "in the beginning of 1914", "towards the close of 1914")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., "were compelled" and "had figured" in close proximity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with the significance of specific locations (e.g., Ypres, Calais, Warsaw) without brief contextualization.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing the battle of Ypres and introducing the chapter "New Opportunities for the Allies" without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Overly dense paragraphs with multiple, interconnected points that could be separated for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
