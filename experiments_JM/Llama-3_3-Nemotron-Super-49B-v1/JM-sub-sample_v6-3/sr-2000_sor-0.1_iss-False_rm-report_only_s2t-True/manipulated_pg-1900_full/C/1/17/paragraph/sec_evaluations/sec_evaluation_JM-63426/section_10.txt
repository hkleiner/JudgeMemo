Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transitions between biographical narrative and chronological list (e.g., shifting from descriptive text to date lists without clear connectors)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic language in some sections (e.g., "gleam as brightly", "dean of American typographers") may hinder readability for some readers
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent formatting between descriptive paragraphs and the list of dated events, potentially causing visual disruption

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear thematic connection between the horror narrative and the biographical/textual information (assuming the task is to evaluate coherence within the provided "Current Segment" which seems to juxtapose unrelated content without explanation)
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift in content type (from narrative to biography to dated list) without transitional elements
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the purpose or relationship between the different types of content presented (narrative, biography, achievements list)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
