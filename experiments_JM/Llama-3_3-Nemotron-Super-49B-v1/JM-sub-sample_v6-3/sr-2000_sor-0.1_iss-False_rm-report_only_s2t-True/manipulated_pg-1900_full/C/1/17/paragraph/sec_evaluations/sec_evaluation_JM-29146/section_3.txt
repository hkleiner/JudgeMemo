Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "whithpered" (likely "whispered"), "elth" (likely "else"), "latht" (likely "last")
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, affecting flow (e.g., the paragraph starting with "Thoughts raced through Ramsey's mind")
- [LEXICON] Occasional word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern writing (e.g., "rictus of pain", "muscleless, female-helpless mode")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from the intense scene to the philosophical paragraph about Reynolds (seems out of context and disrupts flow)
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the escape to the room scene without clear transitional elements
- [CLARITY] The telepath's introduction and Ramsey's immediate compliance could be more clearly motivated or set up

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
