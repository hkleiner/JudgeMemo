Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "unprivileged conditions", "epigoni", "muck-rake") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing economic prosperity to intellectual and spiritual movements, while logical in a broader context, feels somewhat abrupt without transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] The digression about comparing portraits of great Victorians with modern figures, though engaging, slightly disrupts the linear progression of the literary analysis.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
