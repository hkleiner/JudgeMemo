Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "sirocco", "mid-eighteenth-century style") might require additional effort for comprehension.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Christmas festivities to a historical figure (David Garrick) without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between defending feast traditions, discussing societal norms, and then shifts to a new chapter without a clear summarizing link.
