1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and inconsistent verb tense in some sentences (e.g., "He was to make his way quietly to Washington Otis's room")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent narrative timeline and setting (historical and fictional elements intertwined)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear sectioning or transition between distinctly different topics (e.g., from Aziru to Canterville, then to Jerusalem)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences and unclear references without provided context (e.g., "the famous Canterville blood-stain")
