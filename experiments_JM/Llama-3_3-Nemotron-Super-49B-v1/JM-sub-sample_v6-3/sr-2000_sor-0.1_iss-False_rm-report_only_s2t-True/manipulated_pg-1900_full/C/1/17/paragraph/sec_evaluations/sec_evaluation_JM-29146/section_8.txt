Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between scientific explanations and historical tangent (Lenormant de Tournehem section)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some scientific explanations (e.g., "subjective time," "duration-lag")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and present in dialogue)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from space travel to 18th-century historical figure (disrupts narrative flow)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequitur historical section disrupts tension built in the space scenario
- [CLARITY] Some scientific concepts (e.g., hyper-space mechanics) could be clearer for general understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
