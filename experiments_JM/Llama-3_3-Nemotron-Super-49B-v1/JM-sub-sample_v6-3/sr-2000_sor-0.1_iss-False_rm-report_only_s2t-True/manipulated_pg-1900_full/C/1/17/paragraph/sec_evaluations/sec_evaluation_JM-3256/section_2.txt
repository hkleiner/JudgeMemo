Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "tombstone", "inconsequence", "genuinely") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasional long, winding sentences (e.g., the paragraph starting with "The bookman has a series...") could improve with clearer structuring.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing literary preferences to providing historical details about the Mescalero Apaches without clear contextualization.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between personal anecdotes, literary critiques, and historical information, sometimes feeling disjointed.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
