Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical analysis (Lecky's opinion) and the ongoing narrative (e.g., "Lecky, a historian..."; lacks a smoother connection to the preceding dialogue)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic language in some sections may disrupt flow for modern readers (e.g., "semi-religious fervour", "worthy grandfathers")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "the breath came hard" could imply a subject for clarity (e.g., "his breath came hard")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, uncontextualized shift from the dramatic scene to a historical/political commentary (Lecky's section feels out of place)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear temporal or spatial transition between Mason's death scene and Shirtliffe waiting beside the road
- [LOGIC] Morley's return expectation and subsequent actions (or lack thereof) could be more clearly connected to the narrative's flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
