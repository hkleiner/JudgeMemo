Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers (e.g., "I became aware, to my surprise, by his ejaculations, by his questions, that he would have been after all not unworthy to be trusted by his wife.")
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "ejaculations", "throb away", "unappeased desire") might affect readability for non-advanced readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that the reader understands the significance of "Hugh Vereker" and the context of "it" without explicit explanation within the segment.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from the emotional impact on the character to the narrator's reflective comparison ("I may say that to-day...") feels somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
