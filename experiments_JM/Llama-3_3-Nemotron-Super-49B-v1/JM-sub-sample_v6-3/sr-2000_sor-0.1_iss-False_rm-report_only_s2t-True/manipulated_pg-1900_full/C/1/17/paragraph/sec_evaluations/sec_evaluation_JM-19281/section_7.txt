Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "exigencies", "inexorably") might require additional cognitive effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing religious influence and the anecdote about Madame Bettina (appears unrelated to the preceding and following content).
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs convey multiple, loosely connected ideas, potentially confusing the reader about the primary focus.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
