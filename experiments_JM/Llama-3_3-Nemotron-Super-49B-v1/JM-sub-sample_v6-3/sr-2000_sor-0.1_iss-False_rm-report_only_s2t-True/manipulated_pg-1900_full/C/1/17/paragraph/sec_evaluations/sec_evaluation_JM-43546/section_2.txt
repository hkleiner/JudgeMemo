Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., descriptions of Uncle Alan's life and Scotland's geography) may slightly impede smooth reading.
- [LEXICON] Informal, explanatory asides (e.g., about porridge, marmalade, and Scotland's daylight) might disrupt narrative flow for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Uncle Alan's estate to the "SCHOOL-DAYS AND HOLIDAYS" chapter without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about characters (e.g., Ramsey's context, Uncle in Paris) without immediate clarification within the segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
