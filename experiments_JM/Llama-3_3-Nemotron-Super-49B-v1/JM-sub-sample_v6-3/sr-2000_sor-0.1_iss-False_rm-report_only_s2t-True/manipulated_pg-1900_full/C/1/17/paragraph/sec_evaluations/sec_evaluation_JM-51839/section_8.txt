Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between literary discussion (Tennyson) and historical Masonic context without clear connection.
- [LEXICON] Sudden shift in vocabulary tone (from literary to historical without transitional phrasing).
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "in February, 1838" (should be "in February 1838" or include day for full date clarity, though not strictly incorrect).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed topics (literary critique, Masonic history, historical building project) without overarching theme or transitional links within the segment.
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear narrative thread connecting the various historical and literary elements.
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through topic shifts.
