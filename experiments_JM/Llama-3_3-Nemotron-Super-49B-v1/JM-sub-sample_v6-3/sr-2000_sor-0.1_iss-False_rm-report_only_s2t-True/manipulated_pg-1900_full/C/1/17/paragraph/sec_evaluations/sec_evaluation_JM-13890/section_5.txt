Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Cathedral description to Reynolds without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "opalescent light", "lierne vaulting") may hinder readability for non-experts
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of "Reynolds" disrupts the cohesive historical/architectural narrative
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases between distinct topics (e.g., from Cathedral layout to its history and then to Reynolds)
- [LOGIC] The "Reynolds" paragraph seems entirely out of place in the otherwise consistent theme of Canterbury Cathedral

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
