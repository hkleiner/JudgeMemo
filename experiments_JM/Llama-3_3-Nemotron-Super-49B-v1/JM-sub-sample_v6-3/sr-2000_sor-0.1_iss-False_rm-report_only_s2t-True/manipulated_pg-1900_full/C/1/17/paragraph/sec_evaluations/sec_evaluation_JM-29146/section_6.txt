Evaluation Form:
1. Fluency Issues: 
  - [SYNTAX] Slightly abrupt transition between Ramsey's thoughts and the shift to Security Officer Chind's scene.
  - [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "sibilantless") might slightly impede flow for some readers.
  - [GRAMMAR] Minor issue with sentence structure in "Naturally, his lisping sounded perfectly normal to Garr Symm, who also spoke in the sibilantless Irwadi manner." (Could be rephrased for clarity)

2. Coherence Issues: 
  - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in POV from Ramsey to Security Officer Chind without clear transitional element.
  - [CLARITY] The significance of "X" and its implications are not fully clear within this segment, relying on external context.
  - [LOGIC] The ease with which the plan to follow the protagonists is accepted and understood by Chind feels somewhat convenient.
