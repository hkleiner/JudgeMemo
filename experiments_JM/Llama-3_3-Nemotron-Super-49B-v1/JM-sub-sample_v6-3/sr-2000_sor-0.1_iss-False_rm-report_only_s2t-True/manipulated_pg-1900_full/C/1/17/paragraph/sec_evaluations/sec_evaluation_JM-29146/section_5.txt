Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between the letter and Ramsey's thoughts (e.g., "Ramsey frowned...") without clear connection.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "unic-sexual", "deistic god") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unannounced shift in narrative focus (e.g., from the letter to the midden circles description) disrupts flow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing proto-man to describing "midden circles" without clear relevance or transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The segment feels disjointed, with multiple unrelated topics (the letter, breakfast, the wanted bulletin, the midden circles) presented without a clear overarching narrative thread.
- [CLARITY] The purpose or relevance of the "midden circles" passage to the immediate plot or characters' situation is unclear.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
