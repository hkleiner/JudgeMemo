Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some parts (e.g., "A blur passed over Masonâ€™s eyes. His senses became more muddled.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional word choice could enhance clarity (e.g., "queer light" might confuse some readers)
- [PUNCTUATION] Lack of varied punctuation for dramatic effect in intense dialogues

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden appearance of the British soldier in the end feels somewhat convenient
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from campfire story to Robert's solo quest without clear time passage indication
- [CLARITY] Mason's backstory and current state could be more seamlessly integrated for immediate understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
