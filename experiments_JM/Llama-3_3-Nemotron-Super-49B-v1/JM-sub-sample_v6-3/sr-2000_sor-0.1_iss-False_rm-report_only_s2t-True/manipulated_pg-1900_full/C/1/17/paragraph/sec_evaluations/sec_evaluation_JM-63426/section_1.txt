Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex, winding sentence structures (e.g., "It is your first day...") 
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "corn-fed", "lusty", "exquisite backwater") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from biographical narrative to philosophical excerpt ("The door of the knowledge...") without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical context (e.g., "Kelmscott House") and specific art movements without brief explanation for potentially uninformed readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
