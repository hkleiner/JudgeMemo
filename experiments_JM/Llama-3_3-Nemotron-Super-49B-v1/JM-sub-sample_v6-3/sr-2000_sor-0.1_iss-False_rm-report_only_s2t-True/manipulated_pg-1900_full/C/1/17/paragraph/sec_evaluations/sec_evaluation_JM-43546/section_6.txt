Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between Don's dialogue and the descriptive paragraph about sandals (inconsistent topic flow)
- [LEXICON] Sudden, unexplained shift in subject matter (sandals description feels out of context)
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles and inconsistent punctuation in some sentences (e.g., "Sandals of yucca and grasses are found in abundance" lacks clarity on what "of yucca and grasses" refers to)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent narrative structure; blends dialogue, historical description, and sudden, unrelated topics (e.g., sandals)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between different scenes and topics (e.g., from shopping to the Scott Monument to the dog's story without clear connectors)
- [LOGIC] The segment about sandals seems entirely disconnected from the rest of the narrative, disrupting coherence

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
