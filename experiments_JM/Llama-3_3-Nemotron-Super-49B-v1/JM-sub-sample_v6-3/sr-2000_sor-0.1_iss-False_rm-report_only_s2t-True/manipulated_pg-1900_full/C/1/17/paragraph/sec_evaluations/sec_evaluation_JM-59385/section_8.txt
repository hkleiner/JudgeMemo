Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Through her eyes I saw burdens lifted...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "cubby hole", "pass me by") might slightly hinder readability for all audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Kuei Ping's achievements to the narrator's personal experience without a clear connector.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between past and present without explicit temporal markers, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
