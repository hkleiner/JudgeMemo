Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The silhouetting of these two figures against the light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before results are forthcoming."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "opalescent hues", "prolonging themselves")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Millet's art to the "CHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" without clear connection

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unrelated introduction of "CHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE" disrupts the cohesive discussion of Millet's art
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between the detailed art analyses and the brief, disconnected historical snippets
- [CLARITY] The purpose of mentioning the Mescalero Apache Reservation and Napoleon's influence on art is unclear in relation to Millet's work

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
