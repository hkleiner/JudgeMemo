Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between the story of Gerbéviller and the quote "MILKI-EL."
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sentences (e.g., "mental suppleness and activity," "dissimilarity in everything else") may hinder smooth reading for non-native or general readers.
- [STRUCTURE] Unmarked shift from descriptive war narrative to anecdotal, conversational tone (e.g., the bakeshop incident).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Non-sequitur introduction of "MILKI-EL" quote without context or connection to the surrounding narrative.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between distinct scenes (e.g., from Gerbéviller to the Emperor's hill, to Remiramont, etc.).
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the purpose or relevance of some anecdotes (e.g., the dinner party story) to the overall narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
