Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "What she had left of material things would last until the news of her departure reached the Chia compound.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "hutungs", "Hatamen Street") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Kuei Ping's personal narrative to a philosophical reflection on the Industrial Revolution (seems out of place in the otherwise cohesive personal story)
- [CLARITY] The character's emotional shift from seeking freedom to finding joy through self-forgetfulness could be more explicitly developed for smoother understanding.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
