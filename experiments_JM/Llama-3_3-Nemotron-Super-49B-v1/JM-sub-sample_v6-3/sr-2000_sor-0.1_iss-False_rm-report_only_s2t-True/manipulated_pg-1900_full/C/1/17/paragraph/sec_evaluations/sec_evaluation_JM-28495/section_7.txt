Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had been brought" to "moved on")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from wedding description to train accident without clear connection)
- [LOGIC] Unexplained character actions (e.g., curate's immediate decision to help without clear motivation)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connectors between scenes (e.g., between CHAPTER VII and VIII)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
