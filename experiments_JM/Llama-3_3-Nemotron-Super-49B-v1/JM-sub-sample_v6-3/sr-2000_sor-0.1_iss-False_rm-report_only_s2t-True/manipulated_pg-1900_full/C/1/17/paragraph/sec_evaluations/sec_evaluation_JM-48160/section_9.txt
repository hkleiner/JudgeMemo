Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "taube", "blessé", "infirmière Majors") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing hospital conditions to the historical reference about the battle of the Marne.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different hospitals and topics (e.g., bathtubs, private kitchen needs, specific patient cases) without clear transitional links.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
