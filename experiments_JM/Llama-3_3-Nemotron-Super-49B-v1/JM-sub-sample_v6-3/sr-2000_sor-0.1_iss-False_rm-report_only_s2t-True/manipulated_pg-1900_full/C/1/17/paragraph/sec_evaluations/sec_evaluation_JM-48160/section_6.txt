Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and present in different paragraphs)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of funeral customs in the middle of a war context
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between some paragraphs (e.g., reconstruction plans, Heine's quote, and town ruins)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of locations and historical context (e.g., "the Marne", Heine's prophecy) without brief explanation
