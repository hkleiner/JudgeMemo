Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between Rosa Bonheur's biography and the unrelated Otis family scene.
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "piously preserved", "veritable monument of affectionate admiration").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "it was Miss Anna Klumpke who closed the eyes of Rosa Bonheur" (passive voice, though clear).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected narrative shift from Rosa Bonheur's life to the Otis family scenario.
- [LOGIC] Lack of contextual connection between the two distinct narrative threads.
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to connect disparate scenes.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2
