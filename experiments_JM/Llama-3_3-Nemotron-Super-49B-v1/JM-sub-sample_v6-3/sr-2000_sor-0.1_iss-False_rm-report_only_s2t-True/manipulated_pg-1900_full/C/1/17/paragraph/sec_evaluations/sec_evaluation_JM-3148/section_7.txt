Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between poetic description and factual statement ("The crater torn by the powder...") disrupting flow.
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary in some dialogue ("command the ship for a while") may feel slightly incongruous with character tone.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, uncontextualized introduction of "The crater..." paragraph disrupts narrative coherence.
- [LOGIC] Temporal and contextual disconnect between the emotional dialogue scene and the preceding descriptive passages (e.g., historical/economic commentary, hen's behavior).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
