Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Rosa Bonheur's studio to Bahá’u’lláh’s writings without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "veritable farm", "heterogeneous menagerie") may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected mention of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings disrupts the narrative flow focused on Rosa Bonheur
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological jumps in the biography (e.g., moving from 1855 to 1860 without clear transitional phrases)
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, reducing clarity (e.g., the description of English vs. French appreciation for Rosa Bonheur’s work)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
