Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "to make which men carried pure white marble all the way from India" (awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "blessedness" (less common, might affect readability for some readers)
- [GRAMMAR] "None of them have any pay" (subject-verb agreement could be improved to "None of them has any pay" for strict correctness, though commonly accepted)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from descriptive scenes to explaining the role of a t'umu without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Assumption that the reader is familiar with what a "t'umu" is without introduction
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden change in topic from spiritual practices to governance and social norms without transitional phrase
