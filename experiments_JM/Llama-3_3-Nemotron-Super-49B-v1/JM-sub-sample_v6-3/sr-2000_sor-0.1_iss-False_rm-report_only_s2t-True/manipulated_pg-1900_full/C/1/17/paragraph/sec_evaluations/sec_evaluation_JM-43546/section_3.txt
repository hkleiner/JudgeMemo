Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from Donald's daily life to the explanation of Hebrew)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "workaday world", "intellect as the 'dim religious light'") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "you don't get to be a wise man by playing any kind of a game all of the time" could be more concise

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected shift from describing Donald's life to discussing Hebrew and rituals
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear connection between the initial narrative and the later philosophical/explanatory segment
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to connect disparate topics
