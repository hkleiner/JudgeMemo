Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., first paragraph of the current segment)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "whizzing", "cataclysmic danger", "lackeys")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnect between the astronomy discussion and the transition to social justice without clear bridging (though context from the previous section might mitigate this)
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing social reformers to introducing the chapter on Christmas without a smooth connector

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
