Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "Supposing the attack to be only temporary, I paused...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "luscious looking se√±oritas", "St. Vitus") might require additional processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing a social event to discussing household economics without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] The narrative voice shifts between personal anecdote and broader societal commentary without clear segmentation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
