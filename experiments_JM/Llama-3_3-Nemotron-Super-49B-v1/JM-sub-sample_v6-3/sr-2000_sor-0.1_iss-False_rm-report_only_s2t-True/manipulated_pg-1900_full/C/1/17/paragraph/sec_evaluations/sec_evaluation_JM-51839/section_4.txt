1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "paroxysm of panic") might slightly hinder readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing prosperity to introducing political troubles without a clear connecting phrase.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and events (e.g., from the "Run-Away Scrape" to "The Republic" without a clear chronological bridge).
