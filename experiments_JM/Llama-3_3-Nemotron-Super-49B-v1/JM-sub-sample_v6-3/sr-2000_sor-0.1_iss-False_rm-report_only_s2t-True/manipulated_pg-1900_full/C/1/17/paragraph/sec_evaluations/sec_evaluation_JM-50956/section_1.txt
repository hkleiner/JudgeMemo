Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between literary references (e.g., Tennyson) and war statistics.
- [LEXICON] Archaic language usage (e.g., "seas of blood and tears") may hinder modern readability.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected narrative about the Confederate army (Fort Stedman) disrupts the focus on Russia's WWI role.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential discussion of historical events (jumps between 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917 without clear chronological flow).
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences (e.g., the explanation of Russia's impact on the war's outcome) may confuse readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
