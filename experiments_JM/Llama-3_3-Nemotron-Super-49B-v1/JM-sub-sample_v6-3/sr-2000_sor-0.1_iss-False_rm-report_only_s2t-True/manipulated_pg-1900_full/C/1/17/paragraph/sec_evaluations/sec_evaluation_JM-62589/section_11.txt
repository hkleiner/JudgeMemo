- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "came Doctor Bell" after past perfect contexts)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from emotional reunion to descriptive passage about head-dress
- [LOGIC] Unresolved transition between Debby's decision to return to America and the subsequent scenes in England
