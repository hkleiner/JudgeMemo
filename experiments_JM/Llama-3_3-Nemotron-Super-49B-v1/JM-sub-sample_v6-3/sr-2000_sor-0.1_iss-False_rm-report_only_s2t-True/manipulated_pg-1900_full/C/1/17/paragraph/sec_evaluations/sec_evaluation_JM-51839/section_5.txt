Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and descriptive paragraph about Comanches.
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some sections (e.g., "bids a hearty welcome") may disrupt flow for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "These “Lords of the South Plains,” ... looked and dressed every bit the now “Hollywood” Indian." (missing article before "Hollywood Indian" for clarity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of Comanches description disrupts historical continuity.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between the end of the war's impact on Nacogdoches and the introduction of the railroad's positive effects.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from discussing the town's revival to a detailed history of the Old Stone Fort without a clear connecting thread.
