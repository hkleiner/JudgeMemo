Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "puerile", "exuberance") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the universalism of God and the concept of a Chosen People could be more clearly articulated.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from biblical analysis to quoting Tennyson and then to Science feels somewhat abrupt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
