Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "enfeebled", "stupendous") might affect readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Russia's past military role to speculating about its future geopolitical influence could be more explicitly connected.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between historical analysis, geopolitical prediction, and philosophical musings without clear transitional markers.
