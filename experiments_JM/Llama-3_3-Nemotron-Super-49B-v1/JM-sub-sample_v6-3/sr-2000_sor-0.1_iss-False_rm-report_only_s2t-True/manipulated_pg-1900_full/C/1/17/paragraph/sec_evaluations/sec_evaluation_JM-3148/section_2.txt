Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If he were difficult to understand, it reflected more upon his eccentricity than upon her density.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "guerdon", "barbaric thing") might require additional context for full comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Anthony's childhood to his activities at 15 without transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] The text assumes knowledge of the characters' past (e.g., Marie, La MÃ¨re) without providing context within this segment

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
