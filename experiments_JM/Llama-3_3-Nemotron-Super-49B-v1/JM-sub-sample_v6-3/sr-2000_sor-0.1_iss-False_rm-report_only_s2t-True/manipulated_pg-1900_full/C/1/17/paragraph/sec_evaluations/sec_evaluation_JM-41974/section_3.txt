Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but "verge upon prodigy") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's works to a paragraph about Boucher, disrupting the narrative flow focused on Veronese.
- [CLARITY] The quote "Whatsoever is raised on this foundation..." lacks immediate contextual explanation, potentially confusing readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
