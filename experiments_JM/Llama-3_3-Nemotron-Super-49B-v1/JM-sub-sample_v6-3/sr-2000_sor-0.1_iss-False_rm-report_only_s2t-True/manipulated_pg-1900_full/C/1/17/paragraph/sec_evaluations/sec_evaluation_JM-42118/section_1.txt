Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical narrative and "Y-yes, but I'm the only Vegan girl in Irwadi City. He'll find me. He'll find me when he's ready." (incongruous dialogue)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may impede smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "gadding", "fopperies", "attenuated ghosts")
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from descriptive prose to factual listing (metates description)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Incongruous inclusion of unrelated dialogue ("Y-yes...") disrupts historical coherence
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Grasse to historical events in Paris without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential age references for the protagonist (e.g., thirteen, sixteen, fifteen summers)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
