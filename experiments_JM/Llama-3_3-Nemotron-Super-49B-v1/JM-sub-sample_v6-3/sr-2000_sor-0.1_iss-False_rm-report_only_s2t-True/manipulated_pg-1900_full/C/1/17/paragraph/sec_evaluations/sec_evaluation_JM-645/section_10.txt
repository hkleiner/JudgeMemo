Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some passages (e.g., "I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder immediate understanding for some readers (e.g., "renannouncement", "geographically")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrative focus from Vereker's secret to the birth of children and the wife's death without clear transitional link.
- [CLARITY] The protagonist's motivations and expectations from Drayton Deane are somewhat ambiguous until the smoking-room scene.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
