Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in multiple paragraphs (e.g., the description of the robe's value and the surf-shooting sport)
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "beheld", "revelry", "dizzying depth")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing Oxford commas in lists)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the Philippine mission to detailing the Hawaiian stop and back (lacks clear connection)
- [LOGIC] Unnecessary inclusion of the Napoleon anecdote (distracts from the main narrative)
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions sometimes obscure the main point (e.g., the extensive description of the Bishop Museum)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
