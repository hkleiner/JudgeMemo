Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in descriptions of military movements and fortifications (e.g., "Throughout the early morning hours of that day Beauregard had his men busily engaged in the construction of this defense line.")
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "about" in time and distance descriptions (e.g., "about a mile closer to the city", "about 12:30 a.m.")
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "many of the men using their bayonets, their knives, and even their tin cans" (should be "their" before each item for consistency, though this is a minor stylistic point)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing Petersburg's importance to the start of the Battle of Petersburg without a clear linking sentence.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about the significance of specific roads and railroads without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different time frames (e.g., from the 1860 census to the 1862 Peninsular Campaign to 1864 events) without clear chronological markers for readers not deeply familiar with the timeline.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
