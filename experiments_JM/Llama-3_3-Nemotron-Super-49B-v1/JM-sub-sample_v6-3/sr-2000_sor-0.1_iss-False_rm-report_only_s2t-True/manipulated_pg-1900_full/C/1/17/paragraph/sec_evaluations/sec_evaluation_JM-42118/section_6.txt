Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "thou", "thee", not present but implied need for modern readers) and overly formal tone might hinder smooth reading for all audiences.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the royal family's downfall to focusing on Fragonard's personal and artistic life.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical figures (e.g., Fragonard, Bergeret de Grandcour) without introduction might confuse unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
