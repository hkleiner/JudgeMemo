Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "prodigal hand", "mock-heroic", "pulsing evening of a century")
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, long sentences require careful reading to follow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between discussing Marguerite GÃ©rard's life and the broader artistic context of 18th-century France
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly abstract or poetic, potentially confusing the text's main points for casual readers (e.g., "uttering its swan's note", "skimming over the dangerous deeps")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
