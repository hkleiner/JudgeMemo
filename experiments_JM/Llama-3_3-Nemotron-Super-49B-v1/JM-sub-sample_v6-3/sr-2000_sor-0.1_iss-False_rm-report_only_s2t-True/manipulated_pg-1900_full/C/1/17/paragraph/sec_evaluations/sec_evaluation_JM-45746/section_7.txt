- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing teacher support to introducing "CHAPTER: THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY" without clear connection.
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear subsectioning or signaling of topic shifts within the long, diverse discussion.
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous statement: "In fact, to some extent it has become too great a factor and the home has permitted or even forced the school to take over certain responsibilities that cannot well be delegated." (Unclear which responsibilities)
