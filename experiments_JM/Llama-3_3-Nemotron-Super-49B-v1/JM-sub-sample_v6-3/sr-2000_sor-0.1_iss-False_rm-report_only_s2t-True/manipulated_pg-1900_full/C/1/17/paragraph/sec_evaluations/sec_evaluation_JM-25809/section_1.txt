Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt shift from poetic description to historical tangent (Boucher's favor at Court)
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for some readers (e.g., "slumgullion", "th-r-r-up")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "had sunk" to "got")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps (e.g., from Jim's despair to the historical anecdote)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the letter's content and the subsequent description of Jim's actions
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of unrelated character backstory (Lady Barbara Modish) without clear relevance

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
