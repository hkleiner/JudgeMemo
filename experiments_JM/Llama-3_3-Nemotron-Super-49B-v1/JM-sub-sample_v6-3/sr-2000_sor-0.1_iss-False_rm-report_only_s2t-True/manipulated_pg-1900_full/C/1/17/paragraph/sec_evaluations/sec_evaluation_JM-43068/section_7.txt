Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "quasi-classic", "bombastic effusion") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's life/art to "The major result of the opening 4 days of combat" disrupts coherence.
- [LOGIC] The text assumes familiarity with referenced artworks without providing context for all (e.g., "Breaking the Clod", "Man with the Hoe").

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
