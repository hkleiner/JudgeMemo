Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Slightly complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] Use of somewhat archaic or formal vocabulary (e.g., "beyond recall", "civilised world") might affect readability for non-specialist readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the loss of colour harmony to the artist's lasting fame feels somewhat abrupt.
- [CLARITY] The assertion about draughtsmanship's variability lacks a direct example or elaboration within this segment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
