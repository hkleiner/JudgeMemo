Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "After that, distended to his utmost limits, he went to sleep in the sun, with the bone between his paws.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might slightly hinder readability for all audiences (e.g., "intercepted", "damesel", "patrician calm")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Excalibur's bone incident to the dinner party and then to the walk (lacks a smoother connection between distinct narrative segments)
- [CLARITY] The philosophical quote seems out of context and disrupts the narrative flow without clear relevance explained

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
