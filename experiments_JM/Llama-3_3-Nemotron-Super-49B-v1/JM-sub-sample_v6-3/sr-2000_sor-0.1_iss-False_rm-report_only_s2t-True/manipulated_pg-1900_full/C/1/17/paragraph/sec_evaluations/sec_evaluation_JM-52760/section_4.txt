1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may impede smooth reading in some areas.
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "mini√© balls", "rabisu") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from technical tunnel details to the "TAGI" quote without clear connection.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between the battle's progression and specific troop movements without always providing a clear timeline link.
