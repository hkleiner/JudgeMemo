Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "resplendent and intense register", "literal-minded drama") may hinder readability for non-specialist readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasional long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph discussing color sense) require careful reading to follow.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's artistic style to describing a Buddhist temple setting (appears unrelated to the rest of the text).
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of Meissonier, Titian, Paolo Veronese, and Marmot without introduction, potentially confusing unfamiliar readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
