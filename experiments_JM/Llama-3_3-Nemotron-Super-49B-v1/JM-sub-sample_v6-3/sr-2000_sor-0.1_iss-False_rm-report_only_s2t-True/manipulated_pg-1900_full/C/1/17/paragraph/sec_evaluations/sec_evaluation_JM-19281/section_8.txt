Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "suzerain", "bakshìsh") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the Bahá'í community's unity to historical examples of disunity and then to Covenant-breaking without clear connective tissue.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between multiple topics (unity, evil, historical conflict, Covenant-breaking) without a clear overarching narrative thread within the excerpt.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
