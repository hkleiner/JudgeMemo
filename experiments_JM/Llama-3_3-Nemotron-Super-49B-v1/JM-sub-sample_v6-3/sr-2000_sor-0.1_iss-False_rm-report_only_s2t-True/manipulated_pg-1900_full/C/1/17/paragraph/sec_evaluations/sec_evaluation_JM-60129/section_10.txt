Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "doukey caravans", "Dungan revolt") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from geographical description to the arrival in Li-yen and the historical/personal anecdote feels somewhat abrupt.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about "Potanin's expedition" and its significance without brief elaboration.
