Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialists (e.g., "heteropathic", "entelechy", "Ã©lan vital").
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, convoluted sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph starting with "It must be confessed...").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumptions about the reader's familiarity with Spencer's works and philosophical concepts without clear context.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing cognitive relations to introducing the billiard-ball example without a clear link.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
