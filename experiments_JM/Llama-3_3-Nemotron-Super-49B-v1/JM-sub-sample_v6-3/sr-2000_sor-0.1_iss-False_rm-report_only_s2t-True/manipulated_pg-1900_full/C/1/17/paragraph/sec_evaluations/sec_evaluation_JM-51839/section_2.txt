Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It is very probable that Dr. Longâ€™s expedition would have been completely successful if it had been organized a year later...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "somnolent", "rendezvous") might require additional effort for general readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with the broader historical context (e.g., implications of the Napoleonic upheaval, the revolutionary movement in Spain).
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the Neutral Ground to introducing the Mexican Revolution Against Spain without a clear connecting sentence.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
