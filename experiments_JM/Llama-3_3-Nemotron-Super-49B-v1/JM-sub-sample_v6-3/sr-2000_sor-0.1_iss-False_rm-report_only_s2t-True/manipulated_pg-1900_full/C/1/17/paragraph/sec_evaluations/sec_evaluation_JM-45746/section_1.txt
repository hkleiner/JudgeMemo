Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from school visit to Ottoman Empire context without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Some sentence structures are overly complex, potentially hindering smooth reading (e.g., "Given the earlier events in Baghdad...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in topic from teaching profession to artistic description (Boucher's art)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between anecdotes (school visit, Ottoman Empire, Boucher's art, and teaching principles)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
