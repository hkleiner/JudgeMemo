Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is" (repeated lisp portrayal, while stylistic, may slightly impede reading flow for some)
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common word choices (e.g., "splay-tongued", "ecthra-planetarieth") might reduce fluency for casual readers
- [SYNTAX] Occasional long, complex sentences (e.g., describing Madame Bauche) could interrupt smooth reading

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey's scene to the detailed description of Madame Bauche without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The purpose or relevance of Madame Baucheâ€™s introduction at this point is unclear, potentially confusing the narrative flow
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the spaceport to Englander's flat feels somewhat disconnected without a smoother link

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
