Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "Last week I saw such a case..." and the preceding paragraph about the bookman's habits.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "reking with infection", "disinfectant", "commercial conversation") may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article before "certain shop" (should be "a certain shop" for consistency).
- [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentence structures (e.g., the paragraph describing the bookman's sacrifices) may impede fluent reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of "The matter transmitter" and philosophical quotes near the end, disrupting the cohesive theme of book collecting.
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps illogically from discussing bookmen to a science fiction element ("The matter transmitter") without context or transition.
- [CLARITY] The purpose and relevance of the quote about "sanctified Mirrors" are unclear in the context of the surrounding text.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases or sentences when shifting from one idea to another (e.g., from the bookman's habits to the example of seeing such a case).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
