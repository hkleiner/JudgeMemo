Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical and fictional dialogue ("And do not I love you?" after historical context)
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent tone due to juxtaposition of formal historical narrative and emotional, romantic dialogue
- [STRUCTURE] Unannounced shift from descriptive historical events to a personal, dramatic scene

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Illogical sequence: Historical battle descriptions followed by unrelated romantic dialogue without contextual link
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of transitional element or clear segmentation between distinct narrative types (historical vs. fictional/personal)
- [CLARITY] Confusion due to unexplained shift in subject matter and narrative voice

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
