Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "If a Source of phenomena be postulated, why not postulate One Source of all phenomena from the very meanest to the very highest?")
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic language ("ab initio", "whence", "thence") may hinder readability for some readers
- [LENGTH] Excessively long paragraphs without clear section breaks

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing scientific concepts to the biographical anecdote about the President/R.A. (seems unrelated to the preceding and following text)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential introduction of concepts (e.g., "But in the doctrine of implication..." assumes prior context not provided in the segment)
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract concepts without sufficient explanatory examples for general understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
