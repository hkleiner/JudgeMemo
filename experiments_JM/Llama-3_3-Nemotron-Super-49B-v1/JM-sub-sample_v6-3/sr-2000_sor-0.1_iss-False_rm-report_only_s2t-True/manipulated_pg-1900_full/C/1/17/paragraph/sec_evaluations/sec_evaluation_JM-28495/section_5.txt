Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If you had not told me we should have been miserable separately. Now that you have told me, we can be miserable together.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "coram populo", "bunker" in golf context) might require additional processing for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Excalibur's narrative to the curate and Eileen's financial discussion without clear transitional link
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt change in scene (e.g., from golfing to the couple's conversation on the grass) without preparatory cues

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
