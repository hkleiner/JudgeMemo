Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Sudden shift in sentence structure from dialogue to narrative without clear transitional phrase ("THE END" feels abrupt)
- [LEXICON] Overly simplistic conclusion ("THE END") for a presumably complex narrative

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt conclusion without tying up potential loose ends or providing closure on the characters' future beyond a vague statement
- [CLARITY] The phrase "THE END" might feel out of place or too simplistic for the narrative's depth

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
