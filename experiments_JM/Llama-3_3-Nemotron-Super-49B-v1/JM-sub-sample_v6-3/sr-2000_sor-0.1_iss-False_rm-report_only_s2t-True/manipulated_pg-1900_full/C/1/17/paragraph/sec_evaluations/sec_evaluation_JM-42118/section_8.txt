Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between historical and biographical narratives (e.g., shift from Du Barry to Fragonard without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic language may impede smooth reading for modern audiences (e.g., "rumbling on clattering wheels", "travail that had come upon France")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in a few places, though not pervasive)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative jumps between different time periods and storylines (Fragonard, French Revolution events, Napoleon's rise) without clear thematic or chronological connectors
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical figures and events without brief contextualization for potentially uninformed readers (e.g., Du Barry, Robespierre, Napoleon)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, leading to a disjointed reading experience

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
