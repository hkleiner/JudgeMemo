Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "The storm had been muttering and growling its curses for years before the death of Louis the Fifteenth."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or less common vocabulary (e.g., "reckless Paris", "hellish business") may hinder smooth reading for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing Fragonard's personal life to the philosophical section on unity (seems out of context).
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological narrative jumps (e.g., from Fragonard's life to the Revolution's events without clear connectors).
- [CLARITY] Overly dense historical information without sufficient contextualization for potentially uninformed readers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
