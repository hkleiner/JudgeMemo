Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from discussing materialism to a sudden, unrelated narrative about Lord Canterville)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "unjustified self-confidence", "transmuting the cumulative learning of the ages")
- [GRAMMAR] Minor: "Its most obvious casualty has been language." (Could imply language itself is the casualty, rather than its meaningful use)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected narrative about Lord Canterville disrupts the logical flow of discussing materialism and global integration
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between the first part (materialism, global integration) and the last paragraph (seems out of context)
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about Bahá'í references without clear explanation for unfamiliar readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
