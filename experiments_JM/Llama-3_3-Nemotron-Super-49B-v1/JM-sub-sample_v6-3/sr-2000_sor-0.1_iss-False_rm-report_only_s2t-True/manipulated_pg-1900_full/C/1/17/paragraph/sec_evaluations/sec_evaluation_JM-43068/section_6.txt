Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "m√©nage", "pecuniary", "stupendous") might require additional interpretation for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between biographical, artistic, and financial aspects without clear transitional phrases.
- [CLARITY] The dream sequence with "exalted words" feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative without further contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
