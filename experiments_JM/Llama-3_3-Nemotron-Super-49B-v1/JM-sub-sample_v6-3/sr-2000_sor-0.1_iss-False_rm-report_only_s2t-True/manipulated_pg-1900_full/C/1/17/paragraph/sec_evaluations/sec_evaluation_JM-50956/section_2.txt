Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia towards the end of the War are obscuring the true historic role of Russia in the sanguine World struggle."
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language may impede smooth reading for non-expert readers (e.g., "sanguine World struggle")
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Germany's war chances to describing Boucher's life without clear connection

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Assumption that readers are familiar with all referenced historical events and figures without brief context (e.g., Boucher, Ludendorf's memoirs)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-chronological and thematic jumps (e.g., from World War I strategy to Boucher's biography to Ludendorf's memoirs critique)
- [CLARITY] Overly complex sentences hindering clear understanding of the author's point (e.g., "It is simple enough to understand that during the two or three years...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
