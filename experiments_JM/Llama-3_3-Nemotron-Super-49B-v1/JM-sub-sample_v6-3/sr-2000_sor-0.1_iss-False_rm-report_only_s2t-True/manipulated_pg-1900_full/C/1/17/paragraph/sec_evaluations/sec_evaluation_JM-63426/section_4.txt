Evaluation Form:

- [GRAMMAR] Occasional missing articles or awkward phrasing (e.g., "You design a cover for a Chicago and Alton Railroad folder. The drawing goes to Rand McNally...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different time periods and topics (e.g., shifting from World’s Fair to Geneva, Illinois, without clear connection)
- [CLARITY] Some references assume prior knowledge (e.g., "the ‘Amen Corner’" without explanation)
- [LOGIC] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from discussing the World’s Fair to starting the Wayside Press)
