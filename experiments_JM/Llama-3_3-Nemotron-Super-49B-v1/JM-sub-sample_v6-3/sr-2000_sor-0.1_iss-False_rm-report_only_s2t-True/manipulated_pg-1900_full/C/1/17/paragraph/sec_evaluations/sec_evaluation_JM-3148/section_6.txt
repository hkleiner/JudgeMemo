Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [LEXICON] Overly elaborate vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "heterogeneous influence", "ethereal purity of the strain") may hinder readability for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures (e.g., "What wonder if to her the music and the musician became one?") might require re-reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from describing Lyddy's interior decorating to her hearing the violin without clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The depth of emotional impact of the music on Lyddy, while poetic, might be slightly over-extended, potentially confusing the reader about the narrative's focus.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
