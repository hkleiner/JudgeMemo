Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "If I was forced to complain...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "taubes", "estaminet", "camions") might require reader familiarity.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from describing the trip's preparations to discussing the author's past experiences (e.g., San Francisco earthquake).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of reader knowledge about historical context (e.g., "the Germans did not pass during their retreat from the Marne") without brief clarification.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
