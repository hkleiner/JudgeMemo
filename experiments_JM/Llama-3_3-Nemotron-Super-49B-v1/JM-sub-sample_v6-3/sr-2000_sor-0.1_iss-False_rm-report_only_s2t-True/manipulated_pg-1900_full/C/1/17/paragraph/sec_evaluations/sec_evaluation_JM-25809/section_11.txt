Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between descriptive paragraph about faces (seemingly out of context) and the continuation of the story.
- [LEXICON] Informal language ("hell-a-whooping", "Bugs") may not suit all readers' preferences, potentially affecting flow for some.
- [SPELLING] "tear" (in "tear-rider") assumed typo, likely meant "mail-rider" (already in text) or another term.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected paragraph describing physical characteristics of unspecified subjects disrupts narrative flow.
- [LOGIC] The descriptive paragraph's relevance to the story is unclear, causing confusion.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transition into and out of the descriptive paragraph about faces.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
