Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between the philosophical passage about reawakened interest in religion and the subsequent narrative about Davy.
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "fructifying sun", "crystal springs of her consciousness") may hinder smooth reading for general audiences.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of the philosophical text ("The reawakened interest...") disrupts the narrative flow.
- [LOGIC] The character development of Lyddy and her interactions, while mostly coherent, occasionally feel rushed or assumed without sufficient buildup (e.g., the depth of her emotional transformation).
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitional phrases or sentences between some paragraphs, making the shift in scene or topic somewhat jarring.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
