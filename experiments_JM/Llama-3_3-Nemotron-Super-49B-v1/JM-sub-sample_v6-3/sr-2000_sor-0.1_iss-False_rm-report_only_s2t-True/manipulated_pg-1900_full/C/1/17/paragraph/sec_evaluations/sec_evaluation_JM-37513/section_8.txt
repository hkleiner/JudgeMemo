Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between philosophical and historical sections (e.g., shift from "The light of men is Justice..." to Tushratta's letter)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder smooth reading for non-experts (e.g., "physico-chemical basis", "cognitive relatedness")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the paragraph starting with "Now there can be no doubt...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unconnected introduction of "The light of men is Justice..." phrase
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic connection between sections (philosophy, history, science)
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references without clear context (e.g., "the second point")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
