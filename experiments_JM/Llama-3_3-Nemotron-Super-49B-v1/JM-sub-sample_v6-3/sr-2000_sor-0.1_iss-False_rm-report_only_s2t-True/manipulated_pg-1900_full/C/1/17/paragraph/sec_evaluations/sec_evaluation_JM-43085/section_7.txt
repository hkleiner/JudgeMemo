Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "bourgeoise", "labourers", "nineteenth century" spelled out) might challenge modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing the "working library" to the artist's distress over painting perfection.
- [CLARITY] The connection between the detail about linen being cut on the bias and its significance could be more explicitly stated for clarity.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
