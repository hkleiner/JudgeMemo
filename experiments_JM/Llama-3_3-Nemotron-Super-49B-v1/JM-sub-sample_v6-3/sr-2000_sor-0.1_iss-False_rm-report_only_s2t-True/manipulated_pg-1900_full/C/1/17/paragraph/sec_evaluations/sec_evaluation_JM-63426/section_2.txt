Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "Just then five new figures..." and the preceding context (appears unrelated)
- [LEXICON] Archaic terms (e.g., "devil" in printing context, "mutton-chops") may confuse modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and past perfect)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained appearance of "five new figures" disrupts narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential age progression (e.g., from 15 to nearly 17 without clear timeline)
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of historical printing practices and terms without explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
