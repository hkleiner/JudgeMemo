Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "For during the time...").
- [LEXICON] Some word choices feel slightly archaic or less common in modern English (e.g., "thou", "mightier power"), which might affect readability for some readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The segment jumps abruptly from Robert's emotional moment with Washington to the broader military strategy without a clear transitional phrase.
- [CLARITY] The shift in focus from Robert's personal story to the army's strategic planning could be more smoothly integrated.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: **4**

4) FINAL Fluency Score: **4.5**
