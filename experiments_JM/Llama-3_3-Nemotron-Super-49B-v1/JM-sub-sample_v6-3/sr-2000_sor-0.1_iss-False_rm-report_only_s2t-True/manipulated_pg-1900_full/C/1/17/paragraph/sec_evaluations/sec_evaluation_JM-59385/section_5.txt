Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was then that he began to smoke a long-stemmed pipe.")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "staccato breaths", "slender means") might require additional processing for modern readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between the narrative of Fuh Tang's illness and the introduction of the second child's birth and death
- [CLARITY] The emotional state and thoughts of Kuei Ping, especially regarding her passiveness during the burial rites, could be more explicitly conveyed for deeper understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
