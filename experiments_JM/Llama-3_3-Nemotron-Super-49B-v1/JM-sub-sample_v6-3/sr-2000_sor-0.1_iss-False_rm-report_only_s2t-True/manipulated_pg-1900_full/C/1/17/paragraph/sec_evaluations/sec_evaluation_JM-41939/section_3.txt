Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "promiscuous contact", "tactless brutes") might require additional interpretation.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Rosa's daily study habits to the detailed description of "Ploughing in the Nivernais" without a clear connecting sentence.
- [CLARITY] The sudden shift in topic to "Beneath the entrance..." seems unrelated to the preceding and following content, causing confusion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
