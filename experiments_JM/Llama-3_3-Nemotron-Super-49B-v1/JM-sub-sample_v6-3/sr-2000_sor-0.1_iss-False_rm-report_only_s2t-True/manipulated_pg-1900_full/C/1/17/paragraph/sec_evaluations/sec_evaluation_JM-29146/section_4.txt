Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt shift from philosophical passage to dialogue without clear transition
- [LEXICON] Overuse of colloquial expressions ("Darn her hide", "Gmph!") may disrupt flow for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., "I have managed" to "I was")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of unrelated philosophical text disrupts narrative coherence
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential narrative jumps (e.g., from apartment to philosophical text without context)
- [CLARITY] Character motivations (especially Margot's) could be more clearly defined for better understanding

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
