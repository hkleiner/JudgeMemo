Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from Kuei Ping to Diderot, then to unrelated narrative about Mr. Otis, and back)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some passages (e.g., "luminous pearls", "drooping moustaches") may hinder smooth reading for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in a few places but not pervasive)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Unexplained and unrelated narrative insertions (Diderot and Mr. Otis passages disrupt the main story)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential memory recall (graduation day mention feels abrupt without prior context in this segment)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between some scenes (e.g., from jewel selection to memory flashback)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
