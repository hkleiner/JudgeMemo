Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "He stood before it, looking in. The hackles rose on his neck." (could be rephrased for smoother flow)
- [LEXICON] Overuse of simplistic verbs (e.g., "said", "cried") without variation
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Ramsey led Margot back to Enterprise." (should be "the Enterprise")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Garr Symm's transformation without clear setup
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt change from action scene to philosophical reflection without smooth connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear implication of Vardin's statement "I am the end-product of an equation" without further explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
