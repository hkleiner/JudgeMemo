Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "It was this same spirit which impelled his fervid admiration for Nicolas Poussin...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "pyrotechnics", "temperament") might require additional context for all readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Millet's artistic influences to the challenges with Delaroche and then to the struggle for recognition (could benefit from clearer transitional phrases).
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about certain art styles and historical periods (e.g., "the back-wash of the Empire style") without brief explanation.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
