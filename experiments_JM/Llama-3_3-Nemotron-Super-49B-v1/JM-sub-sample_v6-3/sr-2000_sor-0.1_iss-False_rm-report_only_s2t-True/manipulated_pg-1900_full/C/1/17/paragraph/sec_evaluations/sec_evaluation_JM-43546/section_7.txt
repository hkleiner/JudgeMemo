Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally long, winding sentences (e.g., descriptions of scenery and events)
- [LEXICON] Informal, colloquial expressions (e.g., "tewky", "Dinna forget") may confuse non-regional readers
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in verb tense (e.g., switching between past and past perfect in some paragraphs)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from train journey to Skylemore Station without clear time passage indication
- [CLARITY] Assumed knowledge of Scottish culture and terms (e.g., "crofters", "Harris tweeds") without explanation
- [LOGIC] Sandy's parcel secrecy feels somewhat contrived for comedic effect without deeper narrative justification

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
