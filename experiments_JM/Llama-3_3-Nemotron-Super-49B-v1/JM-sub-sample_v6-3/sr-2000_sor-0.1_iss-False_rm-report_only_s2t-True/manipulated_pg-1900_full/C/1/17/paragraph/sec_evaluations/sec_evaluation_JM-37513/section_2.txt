Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It will perhaps be said that this emphasis on the philosophy of life and mind does scant justice to the range and sweep of Spencer's philosophy as a whole; and no doubt others will contend that the emphasis should be laid elsewhere;")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "scapegrace", "Unknowable", "Unconditioned Reality") may hinder readability for modern readers
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional lack of clarity in pronoun reference (e.g., "It" in "It is true that the affairs of the mind give pause...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift in context (e.g., introduction of "The Minister" and "Cecil" without prior context)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential discussion of Spencer's philosophy concepts (e.g., jumping between biological interpretation, the Synthetic Philosophy, and the Unknowable)
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract and dense philosophical discussions may confuse readers without a strong background in the subject

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
