Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between dialogue and narrative description (e.g., shift from boy's outburst to historical note about Plympton)
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent dialect representation (e.g., "yer" vs. standard English in nearby text)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent comma usage)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected historical reference (Plympton, 1773) disrupts scene flow
- [LOGIC] Temporal inconsistency (historical note feels out of place in the ongoing narrative)
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the boy's scene and the concluding historical note

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
