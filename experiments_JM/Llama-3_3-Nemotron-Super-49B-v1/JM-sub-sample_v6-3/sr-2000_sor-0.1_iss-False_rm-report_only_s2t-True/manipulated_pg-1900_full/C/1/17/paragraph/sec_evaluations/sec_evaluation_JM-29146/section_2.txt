Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "He'd never been able to tell a native's age...").
- [LEXICON] Some outdated or less common terms ("thou" implied in dialogue tags, though dialogue itself is modern) and overly descriptive passages (e.g., detailed Irwadian physiology) might slightly detract from smooth reading.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Minor assumption required for the reader to fully understand the implications of Earth's galactic role without prior context.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the gambling hall incident to the explanation of Irwadian clothing habits, though relevant, feels slightly out of place in the immediate narrative flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
