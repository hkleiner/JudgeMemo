- [LEXICON] Some archaic expressions (e.g., "thou", "whilst") and overly formal language might reduce readability for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from discussing Meissonier's development to quoting Th√©ophile Gautier without clear contextual linking.
- [CLARITY] Overly detailed descriptions of artworks without clear relevance to the immediate narrative thread about Meissonier's growth.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
