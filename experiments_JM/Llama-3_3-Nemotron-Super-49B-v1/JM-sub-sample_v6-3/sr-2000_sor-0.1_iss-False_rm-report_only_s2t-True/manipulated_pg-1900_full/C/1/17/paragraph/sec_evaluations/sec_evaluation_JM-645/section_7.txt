Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "The consideration of climate imposed itself, and he was in no state to meet it alone.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic vocabulary (e.g., "vamped up", "tiresome condition", "ravished")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional comma splice (e.g., "I didnâ€™t mention this, however; I only reminded her...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in narrative focus (from Rapallo to Germany without clear transition)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear storytelling within the segment disrupts immediate coherence
- [CLARITY] Some sentences require re-reading for understanding due to density of information

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
