Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "A sweet gravity..." and "Anthony put in the last wooden peg..." (sudden shift in scene without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some descriptions (e.g., "rose-coloured dreams", "sustained power and originality") may hinder smooth reading for some readers
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article before "apple-orchard" ("in May-time") for optimal clarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected introduction of "Ramsey" and "Vegan girl" segment disrupts narrative flow
- [LOGIC] Unclear how "At forty Boucher..." paragraph relates to the rest of the section
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between different scenes (e.g., from Anthony's work to "A sweet gravity...")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
