Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., the detailed description of Lyddy's past)
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary (e.g., "virtuous couch", "weepers") may hinder immediate understanding for some readers
- [LENGTH] Extremely long paragraphs can disrupt flow

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from planning a funeral to Lyddy's backstory without clear connection
- [FOCUS] The segment somewhat meanders between different narrative threads (funeral planning, Aunt Hitty's reflection, Lyddy's introduction)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
