Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between Ramsey's internal monologue and the description of the environment (e.g., "You didn't breathe on a timeless world...").
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers (e.g., "un-Earthly", "half-suggestion of the substance of reality").
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (e.g., switching between past and present in descriptive passages).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift in Vardin's character traits (from timid to assertive without clear motivation).
- [STRUCTURE] The inclusion of the historical passage about progress seems disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
- [CLARITY] The explanation of timelessness and its effects could be clearer to avoid confusion.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
