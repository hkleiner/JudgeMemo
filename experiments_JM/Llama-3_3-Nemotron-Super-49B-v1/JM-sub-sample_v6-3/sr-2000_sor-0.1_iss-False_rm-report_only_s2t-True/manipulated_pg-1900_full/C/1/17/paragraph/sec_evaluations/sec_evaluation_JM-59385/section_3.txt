Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., shift from wedding to art critique without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "tiring journey", "civilised world" in juxtaposition with simpler narrative)
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage (noted in a few places but not pervasive)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected insertion of text about Sir Joshua Reynolds
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative flow due to the unrelated art critique section
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between distinctly different scenes (wedding, art discussion, nighttime escape)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
