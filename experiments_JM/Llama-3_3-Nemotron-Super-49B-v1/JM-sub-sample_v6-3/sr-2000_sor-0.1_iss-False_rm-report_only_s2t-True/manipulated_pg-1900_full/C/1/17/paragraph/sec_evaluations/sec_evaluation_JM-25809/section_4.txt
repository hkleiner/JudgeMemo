Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt shift from formal to informal dialogue (e.g., "Youse fellers")
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent dialect usage across characters
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spellings for dialect (e.g., "dat", "yer") - while stylistic, may impede readability for some

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unconnected transition to "In normal space" (Ramsey's explanation) without clear context or connection to the preceding narrative
- [LOGIC] Unclear how the boy's transformation (cleaning up) directly leads to the subsequent natural scenery description without a smoother transition
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the saloon scene and the later outdoor scenes (e.g., from the barbershop to the cliffs without a bridging paragraph)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
