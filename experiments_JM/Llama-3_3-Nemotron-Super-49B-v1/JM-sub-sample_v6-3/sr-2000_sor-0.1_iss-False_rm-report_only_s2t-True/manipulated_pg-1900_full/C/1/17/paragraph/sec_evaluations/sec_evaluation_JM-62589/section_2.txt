Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may hinder immediate clarity (e.g., "How Debby loathed that service. In half an hour Mrs. Lane would mount the stair, rod in hand, to settle her account with the imprisoned sinner, and in half an hour, at a certain woods of which Debby knew, that rascal Jack Martin would be in waiting...")
- [LEXICON] Some archaic language ("gaby", "thou", "thee") might reduce readability for modern readers without context.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Debby's contemplation to the scene with Mrs. Delight (start of CHAPTER III) without clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] The shift in setting and characters (e.g., introduction of Mrs. Delight and William) at the end could confuse readers without broader context.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
