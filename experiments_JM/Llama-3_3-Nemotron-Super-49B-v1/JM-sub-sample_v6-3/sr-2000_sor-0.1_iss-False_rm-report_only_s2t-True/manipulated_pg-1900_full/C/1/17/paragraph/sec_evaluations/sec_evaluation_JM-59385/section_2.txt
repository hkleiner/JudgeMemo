Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity (e.g., "The utter futility of attempting to make East and West understand each other had stilled her lips...").
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary might require a second read for full comprehension (e.g., "soothsayers", "cyclic animals", "black and yellow days").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Kuei Ping's memories to the soothsayers' examination without clear transitional phrases.
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative might confuse readers not expecting the time jumps (e.g., from graduation day to childhood soothsayers).

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
