Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between paragraphs (e.g., from janitor story to "CHAPTER" and then to unrelated historical and statistical content)
- [LEXICON] Archaic language use (e.g., "coöperative", "protégée", "Mère Bauche") may hinder modern readability
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage across different narrative sections

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative with unrelated segments (janitor story, historical snippet, statistical data, educational discussion) without clear thematic connection
- [LOGIC] Lack of explicit connection between the initial anecdote and the subsequent "CHAPTER" heading's topic
- [CLARITY] Sudden, unexplained shift in context (e.g., from school scenario to Grant's campaign)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
