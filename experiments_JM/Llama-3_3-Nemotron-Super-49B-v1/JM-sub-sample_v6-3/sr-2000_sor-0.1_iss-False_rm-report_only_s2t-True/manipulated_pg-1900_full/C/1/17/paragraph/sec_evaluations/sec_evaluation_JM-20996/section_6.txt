Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between sentences in different narrative threads (e.g., from jungle encounter to art critique without clear connection)
- [LEXICON] Overly complex vocabulary in some sections (e.g., "indissoluble enigma", "pseudo-classicism") may hinder smooth reading for general audience
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in tense usage in a few places (e.g., switching between past and past perfect without clear necessity)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear thematic or narrative connection between distinct scenes (jungle, art critique, leper colony, hike)
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence or introductory phrase to guide the reader through the narrative jump
- [TRANSITION] Absence of transitional phrases or sentences to connect vastly different scenarios

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
