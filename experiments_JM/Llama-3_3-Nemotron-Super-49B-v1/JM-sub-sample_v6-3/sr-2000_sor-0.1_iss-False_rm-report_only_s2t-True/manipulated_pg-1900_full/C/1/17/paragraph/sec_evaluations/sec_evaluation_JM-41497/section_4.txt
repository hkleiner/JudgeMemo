Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "unpretentious monograph", "labours") might require additional context for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from biographical narrative to the final, somewhat disconnected paragraph about the monograph's limitations.
- [CLARITY] The last paragraph of the evaluated section feels somewhat out of place or as an afterthought.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
