Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "I was out in the cold while, by the evening fire, under the lamp, they followed the chase for which I myself had sounded the horn.")
- [LEXICON] Archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "bedlamitical", "envenomed", "scant")
- [GRAMMAR] Occasional comma splices and run-on sentences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift from discussing Vereker to the excerpt about Napkhuria and Babylon (lacks clear connection)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition into Chapter VI without clear resolution of previous narrative threads
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs have multiple, loosely connected ideas (e.g., the mix of Corvick's project, the chess analogy, and personal observations)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
