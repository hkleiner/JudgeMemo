Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity for some readers.
- [LEXICON] A few archaic expressions (e.g., "bespattered", "incorrigible turbulence") might require additional mental processing for modern readers.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Rosa's early life to the start of "THE FIRST SUCCESSES" chapter without a clear narrative bridge.
- [CLARITY] Assumption of prior knowledge about historical events (e.g., the Revolution of 1830, Saint-Simonism) without brief contextualization.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
