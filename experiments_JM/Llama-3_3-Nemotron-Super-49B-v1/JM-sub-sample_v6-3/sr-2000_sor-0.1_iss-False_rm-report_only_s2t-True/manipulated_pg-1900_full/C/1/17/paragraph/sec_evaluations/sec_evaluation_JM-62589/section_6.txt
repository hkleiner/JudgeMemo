Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "CHAPTER VI" and the preceding narrative without a clear link.
- [LEXICON] Overly formal language in some descriptions (e.g., "throbbing nerves", "sobbing appeal") may disrupt flow for some readers.
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article before "woodland road" (should be "a woodland road").

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, unexplained shift from the intense scene to a historical note about the Academy Exhibition (1780 context seems out of place).
- [LOGIC] Character's (Robert's) ability to shout loudly despite being described as extremely weak and on the verge of another faint seems inconsistent.
- [TRANSITION] The segment starting with "There followed a series of interviews..." feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative, lacking contextual setup.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
