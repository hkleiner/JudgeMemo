Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Occasionally dense, complex sentence structures may impede immediate clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or less common vocabulary (e.g., "tertius gaudens", "Nabobs") might require additional context for full understanding.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing social class fusion to warning signs of civilization's poisoning.
- [CLARITY] The statement about "the answer depends on yourselves" feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding historical analysis without clear transitional logic.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
