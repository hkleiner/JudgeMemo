Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "What has not changed is the inescapable requirement of making such choices, whether for better or worse.")
- [LEXICON] Occasional use of less common vocabulary may hinder readability for non-specialist readers (e.g., "inescapable", "transcends", "ubiquitous")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing spiritual development to introducing "But Adolphe cannot always stay away" (seems out of context without prior narrative)
- [STRUCTURE] Non-sequential topic flow in some sections (e.g., shifting between historical religion, personal belief, and societal change without clear connectors)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
