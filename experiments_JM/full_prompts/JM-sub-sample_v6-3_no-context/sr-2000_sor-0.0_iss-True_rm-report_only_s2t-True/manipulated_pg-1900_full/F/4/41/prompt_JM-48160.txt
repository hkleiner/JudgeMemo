You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8051):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front lines, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a "carnet rouge" allowing her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, which she finds to be a somber and impressive sight, with fields of graves marked by flags and crosses. The author's goal of reaching the front lines, particularly Amiens and Verdun, remains elusive due to the restrictions and dangers of the war zone.

Section Summary: The author visited the town of Barcy, which had been under fire for several days, and saw the destruction and cemeteries. They then traveled to Châlons, where they observed French officers on a train, noting their height, calm demeanor, and strong nerves. The author was struck by the officers' ability to separate their emotions and focus on their duties, making them a formidable force. In Châlons, the author had to navigate bureaucratic procedures to obtain permission to stay in the town, encountering suspicious officials along the way. The author's experiences highlighted the stark contrast between the comforts of Paris and the realities of war in the surrounding areas.

Section section_03 (Chars 16236–24224):
Section Summary: The author arrived in Châlons, a war town, and after presenting a letter from the Minister of War, was able to have their carnet rouge stamped and receive permission to stay. With nothing to do, the author spent the day reading a Dumas novel, "Le Collier de la Reine", in a hotel room, and wondered what the next day would bring. The next day, the author traveled to Bar-le-Duc, where they found a town intact but surrounded by evidence of war, including ruins and burned fields. Upon arrival, the author had difficulty finding the Hotel du Commerce, but eventually found it after asking for directions from locals. The author was greeted by a dirty and impertinent cashier, but decided to dine at the hotel before continuing their adventures.

Section section_04 (Chars 24224–32396):
Section Summary: The narrator arrived at a hotel in Bar-le-Duc, where they were largely ignored by the staff and had a disappointing dining experience due to poor food and unsanitary conditions. They then visited the military headquarters, where they were able to secure an automobile and driver to help them accomplish their objectives, including visiting hospitals and meeting with officials. The narrator visited two hospitals, Savonières and Hôpital Central, and was struck by the proximity of the war zone, with a recent bombing incident at one of the hospitals. After completing their tasks, the narrator returned to the train station, where they waited for their train amidst a crowd of soldiers and witnessed a disturbing incident involving a drunken Algerian soldier. Ultimately, the narrator was able to depart Bar-le-Duc on the 5:20 train, relieved to be leaving the town and its challenges behind.

Section section_05 (Chars 32396–40646):
Section Summary: The author describes her experience in a military zone, where she witnesses a drunken soldier handling a loaded gun and notes that people in the zone become desensitized to danger. She visits the War Office in Paris to arrange a trip to the front lines and is eventually assigned an American Army officer, Major C., to escort her. The group travels by automobile, facing numerous checkpoints and delays, and visits hospitals to assess their needs. Along the way, they see thousands of army wagons and camions transporting goods and soldiers to the front. The author reflects on the trip, finding it interesting but uneventful, and notes that she seems to be a "mascot" who is always kept at a safe distance from danger.

Section section_06 (Chars 40647–49019):
Section Summary: The author describes their experience visiting the war zone in France, where they saw large numbers of soldiers, many of whom were not actively fighting but rather waiting to be called to the front. The soldiers were often seen loafing in towns, practicing drills, or helping with the harvest, and the author notes that France still has a significant number of men at its disposal who have not yet been used in the war. The author also observes the impact of the war on civilians, including women and children who are working hard to harvest crops and rebuild their lives. In contrast to the devastation of the war, the author notes the beauty of the French countryside and the resilience of its people. The author also meets with American women who are working on a project to rebuild wrecked towns and villages, and suggests that the ruins should be left intact as a testament to the horrors of war.

Section section_07 (Chars 49020–57368):
Section Summary: The author traveled through ruined towns in France, including Sermaize and Gerbéviller, which were destroyed during the war. The town of Gerbéviller, once thriving, was now a mass of broken walls, but its residents were slowly rebuilding, with many families setting up homes in cellars and women running shops. The author was unable to visit certain towns, such as Arras and Thann, due to constant bombardment, and was only allowed to visit areas that were deemed safe. The military authorities were strict about allowing visitors to enter war zones, and even knowing a General personally was not always enough to gain access. The author ultimately had to settle for visiting less damaged areas, such as Remiramont, and was unable to reach some of the more devastated towns.

Section section_08 (Chars 57369–65436):
Section Summary: The narrator describes a scene where they and an American woman sit at a reserved table in a hotel, despite it being against the rules, and are not disturbed. The narrator also encounters a group of charming newsboys who gather around them, showcasing the unique individuality of the French people. Meanwhile, the narrator and their companions visit the home of a lieutenant in Epernay, where they are shown a propaganda leaflet dropped by a German plane, which accuses the French of barbaric acts and threatens reprisals. The leaflet is seen as a ridiculous and self-righteous attempt to shift blame, highlighting the abnormal mindset of the German military. The section also mentions the founding of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", a French-American society aimed at providing comfort to wounded soldiers, established by a group of prominent women, including several Americans living in Paris.

Section section_09 (Chars 65437–73783):
Section Summary: The author visited military hospitals in the war zone and saw the need for a supplementary kitchen to provide delicacies to wounded soldiers. The standard military diet of milk and eggs was often not sufficient or appealing to many patients, and a more varied diet was necessary to aid in their recovery. Mme. d'Haussonville formed an organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, to provide these delicacies to hospitals in the war zone through voluntary subscriptions. The organization aimed to supply items such as chicken broth, cocoa, and preserves, which were scarce in the war zone and often unaffordable. Donations to support this effort could be sent to Munroe & Co. at 30 Pine Street in New York.

Section Summary: The author visited military hospitals in France and was impressed by their discipline and efficiency, despite some shortages, such as pillows. The hospitals were clean, well-organized, and staffed by dedicated women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who worked tirelessly to care for the wounded soldiers. The author noted that the French people, including the wealthy, were struggling to support the war effort due to financial constraints, and were grateful for American generosity and support. The hospitals were well-run, with attention to detail and attempts to relieve the monotony of the wards, and the soldiers appreciated the small comforts, such as appetizing food and drink. The author appeals to readers to support the French war effort, emphasizing the gratitude of the soldiers and the need for continued aid.
