You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8259):
Section Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians, who settled in the area and built homes around ceremonial mounds. According to legend, the city was founded by Nacogdoches, a twin son of a Caddo chief, who was instructed to travel towards the setting sun and establish a home. The area was later visited by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle, who found a well-settled and hospitable Indian town. In 1716, the Spanish established the Mission Guadalupe, and later, in 1779, Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo refounded the town, marking the beginning of Nacogdoches as a civic corporation. The city's history is marked by the interactions between the Native American population and European settlers, shaping the town into what it is today.

Section section_02 (Chars 8260–16662):
Section Summary: The boundary between Texas and Louisiana was uncertain, and the Spanish government was not concerned with marking it out. Gil Ybarbo, a Spanish settler, built the Old Stone Fort in Nacogdoches as a commissary for military and commercial supplies, which later became a place of refuge. In 1800, the town of Nacogdoches was involved in the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition, which was part of a plot by Aaron Burr and General James Wilkinson to invade Texas. The Mexican Revolution against Spain in 1810 led to Nacogdoches joining the Magee-Gutierrez expedition to drive out the Spanish, and later, Dr. James Long's expedition in 1819 attempted to form the Republic of Texas, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The town of Nacogdoches played a significant role in the early history of Texas, with its strategic location and involvement in various expeditions and revolutions.

Section section_03 (Chars 16662–25226):
Section Summary: After James Long's attempt to free Texas failed in 1819, Nacogdoches regained its prestige under the leadership of Alcalde James Dill, and American settlers began to arrive. However, tensions rose between the Americans, Mexicans, and Cherokee Indians, leading to the Fredonian War in 1826, which resulted in the expulsion of several prominent citizens. The Mexican government's laws and actions, including the prohibition of American immigration, further fueled the conflict, ultimately leading to the Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832, where American settlers defeated the Mexican troops. This battle marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution and led to the expulsion of Mexican troops from the territory east of San Antonio. As a result, Nacogdoches became increasingly American in character, with Americans holding positions of power and the town growing in influence.

Section section_04 (Chars 25227–33940):
Section Summary: As the Mexican government's power grew, American settlers in Texas, including those in Nacogdoches, began to feel threatened and considered resistance. The town of Nacogdoches played a significant role in the Texas Revolution, with many of its residents, including Sam Houston and Thomas J. Rusk, holding key positions in the new government. After the revolution, Nacogdoches experienced a period of growth and expansion, with new towns being established and the city becoming a hub for trade and commerce. However, the town's importance eventually declined as new centers of agriculture and trade emerged, drawing people and business away from Nacogdoches. Despite this, the city remained a significant cultural and historical center, with many prominent leaders and citizens calling it home.
