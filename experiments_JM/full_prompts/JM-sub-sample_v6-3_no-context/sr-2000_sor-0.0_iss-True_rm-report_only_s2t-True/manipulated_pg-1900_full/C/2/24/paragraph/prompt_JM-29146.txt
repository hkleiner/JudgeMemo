You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–16056):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive in a foreign world. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations behind it. The situation is tense, with Ramsey trying to avoid trouble while navigating the complexities of intergalactic politics and prejudices.

Section Summary: Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, is a drunkard who is grossly incompetent, yet he holds a top security job. Ramsey intervenes when Symm mistreats a Vegan girl, Mith, and they escape together. Ramsey takes Mith to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, and she teases him about his situation with Mith, who mistakenly thinks the Earthgirl is Ramsey's wife.

Section section_04 (Chars 23699–31742):
Section Summary: Ramsey is approached by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl and tri-di star, who offers him a deal: she'll pay him 1,000 credits to take her through hyper-space to Centauri. Margot had previously met Ramsey on the Polaris, but he doesn't remember her. Ramsey agrees to take Margot and a Vegan girl to Centauri, but when they arrive at Margot's apartment, she disappears, leaving them locked in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter from someone who claims to have discovered the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which may hold the key to understanding the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter suggests that Margot's journey is more significant than she initially let on, and that she may be searching for something important.

Section Summary: A dying man writes a letter to his daughter Margot, revealing his theory about "proto-man," a being who traveled through hyper-space and populated the galaxy with humans. He believes that whoever discovers proto-man's secret will become incredibly powerful and wants Margot to continue his work. Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, to escape from Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security. They work on repairing a old spaceship in a junkyard, planning to escape, while Margot uses her mind-reading abilities to detect potential threats. As they work together, Ramsey finds himself drawn to Margot, but she remains aloof, using her abilities to keep him at bay.

Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are working on repairing their ship in the Spacer Graveyard, while being followed by Security Officer Ramar Chind and his boss Garr Symm. Garr Symm, a scientist, has discovered something important in Margot's apartment and wants to let them escape so he can follow them and uncover more information. Chind is instructed to plant a fuel supply, U-235 capsules, in one of the wrecks to aid their escape. Vardin uses a scintillation counter to find the fuel, and they successfully retrieve it, bringing them closer to completing their ship repairs. Meanwhile, Margot tries to uncover Ramsey's secret, referred to as "X", but he keeps his thoughts guarded, leaving her curious and intrigued.

Section section_07 (Chars 48296–56677):
Section Summary: Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin prepare to depart in the spaceship Enterprise, while Ramar Chind and Garr Symm watch from the Dog Star, ready to follow them. As the Enterprise enters hyper-space, Margot and Ramsey discuss the nature of time and space in this realm, where time does not exist and travel can occur over vast distances in a short period. Meanwhile, Garr Symm explains to Ramar Chind that radar works perfectly in hyper-space, allowing them to track the Enterprise. The Enterprise encounters "eddies" or "shoals" in hyper-space, which are unmarked obstacles that must be avoided, and the ship lurches violently as it navigates through one of these areas. As they journey through hyper-space, Margot's true intentions and destination remain unclear, adding to the tension and mystery of their mission.

Ramsey realizes that the absence of time in hyper-space could protect them from the harsh environment, and Margot intends to take Vardin with her to explore the world. Margot threatens Ramsey with an m.g. gun, but he calls her bluff, knowing that the gun is useless in a timeless continuum where time is required for it to function. Margot is resolute in her decision to explore the world, driven by her desire to uncover its secrets.

Section Summary: Ramsey stopped Margot from using the matter-transmission device, and then Garr Symm used it, resulting in his transformation into a primitive, caveman-like creature. Vardin, a proto-man, revealed that his ancestors had discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall and regression to a savage state. Vardin, a guardian, had been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and with his mission accomplished, he disappeared. Ramsey and Margot, who had developed feelings for each other, left the planet and blasted off into space, ready to explore and enjoy their lives together. In the end, they found love and a new beginning, leaving their past ambitions and desires behind.
