You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8253):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a "carnet rouge" and is allowed to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as initially desired. The author is offered alternative destinations, including Meaux, which they visit with a French friend, and are struck by the somber sights of the battlefield and cemeteries. Despite the restrictions, the author is determined to see more of the war zone and continues to push for access to other areas, including Verdun and Nancy.

Section section_02 (Chars 8254–16410):
Section Summary: The author visited the village of Barcy, which had been under fire for several days, and saw the damage caused by the war. The author was later allowed to travel to Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and observed the French soldiers on the train, noting their calm and composed demeanor. The soldiers seemed unemotional and businesslike, even when heading to the front lines, and the author attributed this to their "nerves of pure steel." Upon arriving in Châlons, the author was struck by the quiet and stillness of the town, and had to obtain permission to stay overnight from the local authorities. The author's credentials and letter from the Minister of War helped to ease the process, and they were eventually able to explore the town.

Section section_03 (Chars 16411–24585):
Section Summary: The author arrived in Châlons, a town near the war front, and was struck by its silence and lack of activity. After visiting the Préfet and driving around the town, the author had nothing to do and decided to read a novel, "Le Collier de la Reine", in their hotel room. The next day, the author traveled to Bar-le-Duc, where they found the town to be intact despite being close to the war zone, but with evidence of frequent air raids and bombardments. The author had difficulty finding the Hotel du Commerce, but eventually arrived and was met with indifference by the staff, prompting them to use their best manners to request dinner and accommodation. The author's experiences in these war-torn towns were marked by a sense of desolation and the challenges of navigating unfamiliar places with limited resources.

With the help of the military staff, the narrator was able to visit two hospitals, Savonières and Hôpital Central, and was driven around the city by a chauffeur. After completing their tasks, the narrator waited at the train station, where they observed a lively and chaotic scene with many soldiers coming and going. The narrator reflected on the desensitizing effect of being in a war zone, where human life seems to have little value, and they found themselves unmoved by a disturbing incident involving a drunken soldier with a loaded gun.

Section Summary: The narrator was initially denied permission to wait on the train platform due to strict rules, but managed to sneak out and sit with other women, including a farmer's wife who had traveled from southern France to visit her deceased son. The narrator later visited the War Office and was promised a military automobile for a trip to Révigny, Nancy, and Remiramont, but only if accompanied by an American Army officer. With the help of Mr. Beatty, an American Army officer, Major C., was assigned to escort the narrator, and they set out on a four-day journey through the war zone. Along the way, they encountered numerous checkpoints and delays, but the narrator was impressed by the condition of the roads and the sheer number of army wagons and artillery they saw. The trip provided the narrator with a unique perspective on the war zone, with a mix of calm and chaotic scenes, including dusty roads, kitchen wagons, and "parcs" of artillery.

Section section_06 (Chars 41319–49887):
Section Summary: The war zone in France was filled with soldiers, many of whom were not actively fighting but rather waiting to be called to the front. Despite the presence of soldiers, life in the war zone continued, with women and children working in the fields and soldiers helping with the harvest. The author witnessed the devastating effects of the war, including bombed towns and villages, and believed that these ruins should be left intact as a reminder of the horrors of war. The author also met with individuals, including Princess Poniatowska and her associates, who were working on a project to rebuild wrecked towns and villages in the war zone. The author reflected on the brutality of the German army, citing the deliberate destruction of towns and villages as evidence of their ferocity.

Section section_07 (Chars 49888–58379):
Section Summary: The author visited the ruined town of Gerbéviller, which was once a thriving town in Lorraine, and found that despite the destruction, families had set up homes in the cellars and were rebuilding their lives. The author was unable to visit the town of Thann due to its location in a bombardment zone, and despite efforts by Major C. to secure permission, they were denied. The author notes that the only way a woman can visit a bombarded town is with the help of a well-connected general, which they did not have. The group instead spent time in Remiramont, where they saw the effects of the war and the efforts of the locals to rebuild. The author reflects on the conservative nature of the French people, which is evident in their adherence to traditional customs and rules, even in the midst of war.

Section section_09 (Chars 66657–75113):
Section Summary: The writer describes their experience visiting military hospitals in the war zone and seeing the need for a supplementary kitchen to provide delicacies to wounded soldiers. Many soldiers have a strong dislike for the standard hospital diet of milk and eggs, and a more varied diet can help aid in their recovery. The French military discipline is strict, with hospital kitchens closing at 6 PM and not reopening until 7 AM, leaving soldiers brought in during this time without sustenance. A private kitchen, supplied by voluntary subscriptions, can provide essential items like broth, cocoa, and sugar to help nourish and comfort the wounded. The writer emphasizes the importance of this effort, which can help save lives and boost the morale of soldiers recovering from their injuries.

Section section_10 (Chars 75114–82853):
Section Summary: The author visited several military hospitals in France and was impressed by their cleanliness, organization, and care for the wounded soldiers. Despite some shortages, such as pillows, the hospitals were well-run and the patients were well-cared for, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the hospital wards and boost morale. The author met with Mlle. de Sézilles, the infirmière major, who showed her around the Hôpital Central and highlighted the importance of appetizing food and comfortable surroundings for the convalescent soldiers. The author also noted that the wealthy in France were not as able to support relief efforts as they once were, due to the economic strain of the war, and therefore relied on international support. The author appeals to readers to contribute to the relief efforts, emphasizing the gratitude of the French soldiers and the importance of supporting "The Eternal France".
