You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8282):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a "carnet rouge" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the devastating aftermath of war, including mass graves and cemeteries.

They then traveled to Châlons, where they observed French officers on a train, noting their height, calm demeanor, and strong nerves. The author was struck by the officers' ability to remain unemotional and businesslike, even when facing the possibility of death. In Châlons, the author had to obtain permission to stay in the town and was eventually allowed to do so after showing their credentials and a letter from a minister. The author's interactions with French officials were marked by a mix of suspicion and politeness, but ultimately resulted in their being treated with courtesy and respect.

Section section_03 (Chars 16551–24746):
Section Summary: The author arrived in Châlons, a town near the war front, and found it to be gray, silent, and shuttered with little evidence of life. They spent the day reading a novel, "Le Collier de la Reine", in their hotel room, as they were unable to visit other towns or explore the area due to restrictions. The next day, the author traveled to Bar-le-Duc, where they found the town to be intact but surrounded by ruins and evidence of war, including crosses in the wheat fields and burned-looking landscapes. Upon arrival, they had difficulty finding the Hotel du Commerce, but eventually found it after asking for directions from locals. The author was struck by the town's preparations for air raids, including stone cellars marked as "cave voutée" where people could take shelter during bombings.

Section section_04 (Chars 24747–33075):
Section Summary: The narrator visited a hotel in Bar-le-Duc, where they were served a poor meal in unhygienic conditions, and decided to leave as soon as possible. They then went to the military headquarters to request an automobile to visit the hospitals and complete their mission, and were assisted by a polite and helpful staff. With the help of a military chauffeur, the narrator visited two hospitals, Savonières and Hôpital Central, and was driven around the city, observing the effects of the war. After completing their tasks, the narrator waited at the train station, where they encountered a drunken Algerian soldier who caused a disturbance, but the narrator and others present remained calm and unphased. The narrator eventually boarded their train and left Bar-le-Duc, relieved to be escaping the harsh conditions of the war zone.

She traveled with Major C., Mme. Lyon, and their driver, Monsieur G. B., visiting hospitals and assessing their needs. Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, causing delays. Despite the author's desire for an adventurous experience, the trip was relatively calm, with the group passing through roads in good condition and witnessing a large number of soldiers and artillery. The author observed the massive scale of the war effort, with thousands of camions and soldiers, but also noted a sense of calm and inactivity in some areas behind the front lines.

Section section_06 (Chars 41511–49982):
Section Summary: The author observed many French soldiers who were not actively fighting, but rather resting or waiting to be called to the front. These soldiers were often seen in towns and villages, enjoying leisure activities such as fishing or practicing drills. In contrast, many women and children were working hard to harvest crops, and some villages were empty of men due to the war. The author also witnessed the effects of war on civilians, including newlywed couples on honeymoon in hotels near the front lines, and women and children living in areas frequently bombed by German planes. The author reflects on the destruction caused by the war, citing the deliberate burning of towns by retreating German forces, and suggests that the ruins should be left intact as a testament to the horrors of war.

Section section_07 (Chars 49983–58475):
Section Summary: The author visited the ruined town of Gerbéviller, which was once a thriving town in Lorraine, and found it to be a poignant and beautiful sight despite its devastation. The town's residents, mostly women, had begun to rebuild their lives, with some even setting up shops in the cellars of destroyed buildings. The author also learned that the Germans had spared certain homes in other towns, such as Sermaize, because they belonged to German owners who had been warned to flee before the war. The author attempted to visit the town of Thann, which was under constant bombardment, but was denied permission by the military authorities, highlighting the challenges of accessing war zones as a woman. The author's experiences were marked by encounters with resilient and resourceful locals, including a group of charming newsboys who knew how to get what they wanted without begging.

Section section_08 (Chars 58476–66812):
Section Summary: The narrator observes the unique individuality of the French people, noting that there is no single type or characteristic that defines them. During a train ride, Major C. shares a story about a dinner party he attended at the front, where a talented Alsatian chef, formerly employed by Prince von Bulow, prepared an exquisite meal. The group later visits a house in Epernay, where they receive a propaganda leaflet dropped by a German plane, condemning French aviators for bombing civilian targets. The narrator then describes the founding of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé," a French-American society aimed at providing comfort to wounded soldiers, which was established by a group of prominent women, including several Americans. The society's goal is to provide care and support to convalescent officers and soldiers in the war zone.

Section section_09 (Chars 66813–75219):
Section Summary: In French military hospitals, the dietary kitchen typically only offers milk and eggs, which can be a problem for patients who have a strong dislike for these foods. The military discipline is strict, and exceptions are not made for individual tastes, but a supplementary kitchen with donated delicacies such as broth, sugar, and preserves can make a big difference in the recovery of wounded soldiers. Mme. d'Haussonville's organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, collects donations to supply these hospitals with necessary food items. The lack of a private kitchen can be particularly challenging when patients are brought in outside of regular kitchen hours, but with private supplies, nurses can quickly prepare nourishing food to help save lives. Overall, the military hospitals are well-run and clean, but the addition of a supplementary kitchen with donated food items can greatly improve the care and recovery of wounded soldiers.

Section section_10 (Chars 75220–82329):
Section Summary: The author visited the Hôpital Central in Bar-le-Duc, where they were shown around by the infirmière major, Mlle. de Sézilles, and the médicin chef. The hospital was well-organized and clean, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the wards and boost the morale of the wounded soldiers. The author was struck by the dedication and hard work of the women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie who were volunteering at the hospital. Many of these women, despite being from wealthy families, were struggling financially due to the war and were relying on donations from others to support their relief work. The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the relief efforts, highlighting the gratitude and appreciation of the French people for American generosity.
