You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8144):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare or Milton demonstrates a natural instinct for good literature, despite his lack of formal education. Ultimately, the author suggests that a true bookman is one who can distinguish between fleeting, popular books and timeless, classic literature.

Section section_02 (Chars 8144–16251):
Section Summary: The writer describes a bookman who values literature that stands the test of time and has a lasting impact on the human mind. This type of literature, considered a classic, is characterized by its wisdom, style, and ability to transcend generations. The bookman has a diverse taste in literature, enjoying works by authors such as Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey, and appreciates the essay as a particularly delightful form of literature. He is not concerned with the respectability of the writer or the accuracy of the information, but rather with the writer's ability to convey their thoughts and experiences in a vivid and engaging way. The bookman's love affair with literature begins with classic novels like "Robinson Crusoe" and "Pilgrim's Progress", which remain dear to him throughout his life.

Section section_03 (Chars 16251–24443):
Section Summary: The author reminisces about their childhood love for "penny dreadfuls" such as Red Indian stories and trapper tales, which sparked their imagination and sense of adventure. As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, and the classics - Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works remain a staple in their library. The author holds a special place for Thackeray's "Henry Esmond" and Scott's "Heart of Midlothian", two books that they revisit annually, and struggles to choose between the two due to their unique charms. These classic novels offer a sense of comfort and pleasure, allowing the author to escape the intensity of modern literature. The author ultimately concludes that both Thackeray and Scott are masters of their craft, each with their own strengths and memorable characters.

The text then shifts to the bookman's love of rearranging his books, finding joy in the process of organizing and rediscovering favorite passages and authors.

Section section_05 (Chars 32654–40832):
Section Summary: The author describes the allure of books and how they can captivate people, even across centuries. The "mania for books" is portrayed as a hereditary disease that can be passed down from father to son, with the son often becoming infected through exposure to his father's book collection. A bookman's obsession with books can lead to neglect of his family and finances, with his wife often suffering as a result. The author draws a parallel between bibliomania and dipsomania, suggesting that the only cure for a bookman is total abstinence from buying rare or expensive books. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to make sacrifices and even practice deceit to obtain the books he desires.
