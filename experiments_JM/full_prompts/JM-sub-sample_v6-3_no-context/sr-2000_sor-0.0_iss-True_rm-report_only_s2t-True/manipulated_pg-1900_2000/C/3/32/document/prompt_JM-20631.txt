You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8709):
Section Summary: The series of lectures on Hebraic thought and learning was founded in memory of Mr. Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar who dedicated his life to studying and interpreting the language. Davis's work contributed to the revival of Hebrew, which is unique among ritual languages in showing signs of renewing its old vitality. The concept of the Jews as a "Chosen People" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. This idea has been distorted and used by others, such as the Germans, to justify their own claims of special election and superiority. The lectures aim to explore and discuss topics of Jewish interest, starting with the concept of the "Chosen People" and its implications.

  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Missing articles in some places
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some words are outdated or less common
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long sentences with complex structures
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition between ideas in some paragraphs
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Lack of clear sectioning or subheadings
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are wordy or unclear

Section section_02 (Chars 8710–12364):
Section Summary: The Bible contains passages that describe violent and vengeful acts, such as David slaughtering surrendered Moabites and Judas Maccabæus killing every male in a neutral city. These passages also express a desire for dominance and wealth, with the prophet Isaiah envisioning the wealth of nations flowing to Zion. However, these passages must be considered in their historical context and not judged by modern standards. The Bible's concept of a Chosen People and other ideas must be interpreted through the lens of life and nature, rather than being taken literally. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Bible's meaning and avoid misinterpreting its message.
