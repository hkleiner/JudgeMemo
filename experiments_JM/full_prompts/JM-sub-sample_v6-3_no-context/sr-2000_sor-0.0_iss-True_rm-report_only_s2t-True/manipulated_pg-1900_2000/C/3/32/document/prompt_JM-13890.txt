You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8523):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, a new wave of pilgrims has emerged, traveling to Canterbury to visit the site of the shrine, with many taking the train, but missing out on the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement, Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Roman occupation, the city was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many pilgrims visiting to experience its beauty and historic landmarks.

Section section_02 (Chars 8524–12697):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. Prior to 597, the Saxon capital was largely heathen, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard. In 597, Augustine arrived and began to preach and instruct the people, with Ethelbert providing him with quarters in Canterbury and allowing him to preach at the old church of St. Martin. As a result, many converts were made, and Ethelbert himself was baptized, leading to the Christianization of England and establishing Canterbury as the headquarters of the Christian Church. The city of Canterbury has maintained its importance in the Christian Church for over 1,300 years, and its association with ecclesiastical control is likely to continue even if the State Church ceases to exist.
