You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8637):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Middle Egypt were discovered, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform, which were later secured by the government and found to be part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV. The tablets, mostly letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings, revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The two Pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna Period, Amenophis III and IV, belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from Asiatic invaders and expanded its kingdom through conquests. Amenophis IV introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, moving towards a form of monotheism that worshipped the sun disk, a significant departure from the traditions of his warlike ancestors.

Section section_02 (Chars 8638–12741):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, later known as Akhenaten, initially intended to introduce reforms gradually, but the resistance from the powerful priests of Amon led him to take more aggressive measures. He introduced a new doctrine, "the doctrine," which emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, "Aten," and sought to weaken the influence of the Theban hierarchy. The pharaoh built a new capital, Akhet-Aten, and officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, with some receiving high honors and important positions. The new doctrine was seen as heretical, as it was based on natural phenomena rather than mythology, and its impact on religious thought is evident in the hymns found in the tombs. The pharaoh's reforms and new doctrine had significant effects on the royal court and the administration of Egypt, with officials who accepted the new doctrine holding important positions and influencing the governance of the kingdom.
