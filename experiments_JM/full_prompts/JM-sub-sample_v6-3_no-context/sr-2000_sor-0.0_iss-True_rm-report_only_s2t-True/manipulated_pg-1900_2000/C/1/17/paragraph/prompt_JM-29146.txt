You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8099):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is temporarily grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot license. The Irwadian government's move is seen as a power play to control the supply of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially, and offers to help him out with some credits. The situation on Irwadi is dire for non-Irwadian pilots like Ramsey and Englander, who must find a way to leave the planet and pursue other opportunities in the galaxy.

Section section_02 (Chars 8100–13144):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is ill, and gives him 375 credits to support his family. Englander is grateful, and Ramsey tells him to be careful with the money and not to gamble it away. Later, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter, but has a bad night and loses most of his money. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, dressed in flashy jewelry, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent.
