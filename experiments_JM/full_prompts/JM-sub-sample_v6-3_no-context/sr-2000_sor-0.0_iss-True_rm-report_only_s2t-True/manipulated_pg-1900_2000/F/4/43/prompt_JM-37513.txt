You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9137):
Section Summary: The author's interest in science was sparked by reading Tyndall's "Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination" and was further developed by reading Herbert Spencer's works, particularly his essay "Progress: its Law and Cause". Spencer's philosophy of evolution, which describes the transformation of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations, had a profound impact on the author. The author notes that Spencer's idea of differentiation as the cardinal law of evolution implies a universal cause, and that every active force produces more than one change. Spencer's work, although sometimes narrow in focus, made significant contributions to biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and his ideas have been widely assimilated into modern scientific thought. The author believes that Spencer's early essay contains the germ of his best teachings and that his method was most effectively employed in interpreting phenomena from a biological or quasi-biological point of view.

Section section_02 (Chars 9138–12774):
Section Summary: In his later years, Spencer was disheartened to see that his social and political doctrines were not widely accepted by a new generation of thinkers. Despite this, his philosophy of life and mind remains a significant contribution to history. Spencer's philosophy emphasizes the universality of law and evolution, and he believed that all phenomena can be explained in terms of matter, motion, and force. His philosophy is all-inclusive, encompassing biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics as part of the larger mechanical drama of evolution. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy acknowledges the mystery of existence, but seeks to explain everything in terms of the interrelationship between matter and mind.
