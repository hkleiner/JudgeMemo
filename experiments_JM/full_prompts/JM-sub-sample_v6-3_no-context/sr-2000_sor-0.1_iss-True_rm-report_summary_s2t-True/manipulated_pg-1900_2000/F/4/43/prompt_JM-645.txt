You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator reflects on their early career, noting that their real start came when George Corvick asked for their help. Corvick had promised to review Hugh Vereker's new novel but had to leave for Paris due to a family emergency. He asked the narrator to write the review instead, providing them with an advance copy of the book. The narrator was excited to read Vereker's work and meet him, as they had been invited to Bridges, where Vereker would be present.

The narrator spent the night reading the book and wrote a review, which was well-received by the office. However, Corvick was not satisfied, and the narrator began to doubt their work. They wondered if they had done justice to Vereker's writing. At Bridges, the narrator met Vereker, who seemed unaware of the review. The narrator wanted Vereker to read their work and was tempted to tell him about it.

Lady Jane, the hostess, discovered the review and was delighted, praising the narrator's writing. She showed the review to Vereker, who took it to read later. The narrator revealed to Lady Jane that they were the author, but she seemed unimpressed. At dinner, the narrator waited for Vereker's reaction, but Lady Jane did not give them a chance to gauge his response.

A guest, Miss Poyle, asked Vereker about the review, and he dismissed it as "the usual twaddle." The narrator was surprised and disappointed by Vereker's response. Miss Poyle pressed Vereker for his opinion, and he laughed, saying the article was charming but that the author didn't understand him. The narrator was puzzled by Vereker's comment and wondered what he meant.

The narrator had been hoping for Vereker's approval and was disappointed by his dismissive response. They began to question their own understanding of Vereker's work and wondered if they had missed something essential. The encounter left the narrator feeling uncertain and curious about Vereker's true opinion of their review. Despite the uncertainty, the narrator remained eager to understand Vereker's writing and to learn from him.
