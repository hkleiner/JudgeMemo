You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author is writing about her experiences in France during World War I. France is divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author wants to visit the war zone, but it's difficult to get permission. She tries to get help from various people, including Americans and members of the French bourgeoisie, but they are unable to assist her.

She eventually meets a duchess who is running a hospital near Amiens and is able to get an introduction to a high-ranking official in the Military Hospital Service Board. The official agrees to help her, but it takes nearly a month to get the necessary permission. The author is finally given a "carnet rouge," a special permit that allows her to visit certain areas.

However, the permission is not what she had hoped for. She is allowed to visit Meaux, Rouen, and other areas that are not close to the front lines. She is disappointed, but decides to make the most of the opportunity. She visits Meaux, where she sees the battlefield of the Marne and is struck by the devastation and the number of graves.

The author is accompanied by a French friend, Mme. Camille Lyon, and they talk to the Mayor of the town, who tells them about the experiences of the villagers during the war. The author is later summoned to the Ministry of War, where she is given permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc. She is hopeful that she will be able to get closer to the front lines, but is warned that it may not be possible.

The author reflects on the comforts of Paris and how they contrast with the realities of war. She notes that the only evidence of war in Paris is the presence of blind and legless men in the streets. She decides to make the most of her trip and sets off alone, observing the soldiers and officers at the train station. She is struck by their height and health, and wonders if the whole front is on vacation.

The author's trip takes her to the Gare de l'Est, where she sees hundreds of soldiers and military trains. She travels to Châlons, where she will visit base hospitals and see the effects of the war firsthand. Despite the challenges and restrictions, the author is determined to learn as much as she can about the war and its impact on France. She is grateful for the opportunity to visit the war zone and is eager to see what she will experience. The author's journey is just beginning, and she is ready to face whatever challenges come her way.
