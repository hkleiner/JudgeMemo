# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a temple with a conical tower and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. They then entered a sandy and sterile stretch of ground, dotted with Chinese tombstones, and eventually reached a low chain of hills. The only vegetation in sight was some insignificant creeping brush and reeds. 

As they continued, they encountered a typical porous soil with a strong salty deposit, and the landscape extended as far as the eye could see, sparsely covered with grass towards the south. The team crossed the great high road that connects K'ou-li and K'ou-wai and reached the Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu. The villagers, who called themselves Sarö Yögurs, wore a strange costume that the author had never seen before.

The team was offered tea, and the eldest woman, who was very talkative, proudly repeated the name Sarö Yögurs several times. However, when the author brought out his camera, the atmosphere changed, and the team decided to continue to the village temple. The temple was small and poor, and it was evident that it was seldom used. The team met the lamas, who were initially surprised by their intrusion but soon became hospitable and talkative.

The lamas earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The houses in the village were fairly clean and built in Chinese style, with a traditional Chinese sleeping stove and a Buddhist altar. The people wore clothes cut in Chinese fashion but made of home-spun material, and the women's head dresses were very peculiar, decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings.

The Sarö Yögurs had a limited wardrobe, and there was no holiday attire or change of everyday clothes. The women were busy outdoors, looking after cattle and carrying water, while the men were at home. The only handicrafts or home-industries were weaving, basket-making, and knitting stockings, which were performed by the men and women. The cloth woven by the women closely resembled the work of Khirgis women, and it was sold in Hsuchow and Kanchow.

The Sarö Yögurs had a distinct language, which resembled Khirgis and Turkish, but they had no written language. They told the author that their forefathers came from the west, where they had inhabited a city called Shiche-Hache, and that they had moved to their present dwelling places to escape a contagious disease. The team learned about the local administration, which lay in the hands of a pykh and his assistant yarkatshe, and about the tax paid to the Chinese government. Overall, the Sarö Yögurs seemed to be a poor and isolated community, with limited resources and a unique culture. 

The author observed that the Sarö Yögurs were a distinct ethnic group, with their own language, customs, and traditions. They were different from the Chinese and other neighboring groups, and their way of life was adapted to the harsh conditions of the Gobi Desert. The author's visit provided a rare glimpse into the life of this isolated community, and it highlighted the importance of preserving their culture and traditions. 

The team's experience in Ma-chuang-tzu was significant, as it allowed them to learn about the Sarö Yögurs and their way of life. The author's observations and notes provided valuable information about this little-known community, and they contributed to a better understanding of the ethnic groups in the region. The expedition's findings also underscored the need for further research and exploration of the Gobi Desert and its inhabitants. 

In conclusion, the author's account of the Sarö Yögurs provided a fascinating insight into the life and culture of this isolated community. The team's observations and experiences highlighted the unique characteristics of the Sarö Yögurs and their adaptation to the harsh environment of the Gobi Desert. The expedition's findings also emphasized the importance of preserving the culture and traditions of this distinct ethnic group.

Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their houses were built in Chinese style, with only a few being considered poor.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people's homes were traditionally Chinese, with a sleeping stove, Buddhist altar, and Chinese-style utensils. Their clothing was also influenced by Chinese fashion, but made from home-spun materials, with men wearing long coats, fur coats, and trousers, and women wearing similar dresses with distinctive headpieces. The women's headpieces were decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings, and were only worn by married women. The Yögur people had limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items. They engaged in basic handicrafts like weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men making baskets and knitting stockings.
