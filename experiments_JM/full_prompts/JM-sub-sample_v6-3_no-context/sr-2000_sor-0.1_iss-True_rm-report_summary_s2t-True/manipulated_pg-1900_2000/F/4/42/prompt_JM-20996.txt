You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author of the book participated in a historic movement, which is the subject of the book. The movement began on July 23, 1901, when the United States Government sent 499 trained men and women to the Philippine Islands to establish a system of free public schools. This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to the conquered land. The teachers sailed from San Francisco on the United States Army Transport "Thomas" and passed through the Golden Gate, carrying the largest number of teachers and pedagogical equipment to a foreign land.

The ship stopped at Honolulu, where the teachers visited the Pali, a gigantic precipice, and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. The museum featured a collection of Polynesian artifacts, including a royal robe made from birds' feathers, which was valued at over $300,000. The teachers also witnessed surf-shooting, a sport where natives ride waves on a board. As the ship crossed the International Date Line, the crew held the "Revels of Neptune," a traditional celebration where passengers and officers were playfully hazed.

The ship arrived in Manila, where the teachers were introduced to the local culture. They were struck by the rough waters of Manila Bay and the city's mix of old and new architecture. The city was divided into two parts: the old city "intra muros" and the new city. The teachers visited the old stone bridge, which connected the two parts of the city, and witnessed the bustling traffic and cosmopolitan mixture of people.

The teachers spent two weeks in Manila awaiting assignment to their stations. During this time, they experienced the rainy season and the challenges of living in a tropical climate. They were eventually posted to various locations throughout the Philippines, but not before receiving a notice requiring them to supply themselves with certain articles. The author's experiences in the Philippines and the historic movement to establish free public schools are the subject of the book, which aims to provide an interesting and informative account of this significant event in world history.

The book is based on the author's actual experiences and is intended to be of interest to those who are sympathetic to great movements and enjoy stories of personal experiences in distant lands. The author hopes that the book will prove to be engaging and informative, providing a unique perspective on a significant event in world history. The establishment of free public schools in the Philippines was a groundbreaking movement that marked a new era in education and cultural exchange. The author's account of this movement provides a fascinating glimpse into the history of the Philippines and the United States.
