You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator reflects on their career and recalls the evening George Corvick asked for a favor. Corvick had promised to review Hugh Vereker's new novel but had to leave for Paris due to a family emergency. He asked the narrator to write the review instead, and the narrator was excited to read Vereker's work and meet him at a social gathering. The narrator had written about Vereker before, but this was an opportunity to write for a prominent publication, _The Middle_.

The narrator spent the night reading Vereker's novel and wrote a review, trying to capture the essence of Vereker's work. Corvick had told the narrator to "get at" Vereker, to understand the deeper meaning of his writing. The narrator's review was well-received, but Corvick was not satisfied, feeling that the narrator had not fully grasped Vereker's intent.

The narrator attended a social gathering at Bridges, where they met Vereker in person. Vereker was charming and affable, but the narrator was unsure if he had read the review. Lady Jane, the hostess, had read the review and praised it, even marking the most flattering passages for Vereker to see. Vereker was polite but noncommittal, and the narrator was unsure if he had made a good impression.

At dinner, the narrator waited for Vereker's response to the review, but it was not until Miss Poyle, a guest, asked Vereker about Lady Jane's "panegyric" that the narrator heard his opinion. To their surprise, Vereker dismissed the review as "the usual twaddle," saying that the author did not see anything deeply. The narrator was taken aback but tried to laugh it off, unsure how to react to Vereker's criticism.

The narrator had been trying to impress Vereker and prove their understanding of his work, but Vereker's response suggested that they had missed the mark. The narrator was left feeling uncertain and wondering if they had truly grasped the essence of Vereker's writing. Despite this, they were still eager to learn more about Vereker and his work, and to understand the deeper meaning that Corvick had spoken of. The encounter had left the narrator with more questions than answers, and they were determined to continue exploring Vereker's writing and trying to "get at" him.

Section Summary: Lady Jane was excited to show a review of Hugh Vereker's work to him, and she had marked the most flattering passages. When the author of the review, the narrator, revealed themselves to Lady Jane, she seemed less impressed, as if the review was less remarkable coming from someone she knew. At dinner, the narrator waited for Vereker's reaction to the review, but when asked about it by another guest, Miss Poyle, Vereker dismissed it as "the usual twaddle". Vereker's response was surprising and amusing, and he continued to downplay the review's significance, saying the author didn't truly understand his work. The narrator was left to wonder at Vereker's enigmatic response, which seemed to imply that the review had missed the point of his writing.
