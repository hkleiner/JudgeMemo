# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, also known as the "golden tower." The team left the town and headed southeast, passing through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. They entered a sandy and sterile stretch of ground, which gradually rose to a low chain of hills. The only vegetation seen was some insignificant creeping brush and reeds. The team crossed the great high road that connects K'ou-li and K'ou-wai and arrived at the Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu.

The villagers, who call themselves Sarö Yögurs, or "yellow Yögurs," have a unique culture and language. They claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache, which was located 45 days' march to the west or southwest. The villagers are mostly farmers and herders, and their houses are built in Chinese style. The team visited the village temple, which was small and poor, and met the lamas who lived there. The lamas earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and they educate boys for the priestly office.

The villagers pay a yearly tax of 13 horses to the Chinese government, which is collected by an officer stationed at Khunkeitzu. The houses in the village are fairly clean and well-built, with traditional Chinese sleeping stoves and Buddhist altars. The villagers use Chinese household utensils, but some have Mongolian wooden cups. The men wear Chinese-style clothes, including caps, coats, and trousers, while the women wear dresses that resemble those of the men, but with a unique headpiece decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings.

The Sarö Yögur people have a simple and traditional way of life, with no holiday attire or change of everyday clothes. They weave cloth, make baskets, and knit stockings, but these activities are limited. The women are responsible for looking after the cattle and carrying water, while the men stay at home. The team observed that the villagers have a strong sense of community and tradition, but their way of life is also marked by poverty and simplicity. The expedition team was able to gather some information about the Sarö Yögur language and culture, but they were unable to learn more about their early history or legends. Overall, the team's visit to the Sarö Yögur village provided a unique glimpse into the life and culture of this little-known people. 

The villagers' language has a great resemblance to Khirgis and Turkish, but they have no written language. The lamas can read and write in Tangutan, but they are not familiar with other written languages. The team saw some old and dirty Buddha pictures in the temple, which were likely of Mongolian origin. The villagers have a strong Buddhist tradition, and they use white flags with Buddhist prayers to ward off sickness and misfortune. The team's visit to the Sarö Yögur village was an important part of their expedition, and it provided valuable insights into the culture and way of life of this unique people. 

The Sarö Yögur people have a distinct culture and tradition that is separate from the Chinese and Mongolian cultures. Their language, clothing, and customs are all unique and reflect their history and origins. The team's observations of the villagers' daily life and activities provided a fascinating glimpse into the life of this little-known people. The expedition team was able to gather some information about the Sarö Yögur people, but they were also aware of the limitations of their knowledge and the need for further research and study. 

The team's visit to the Sarö Yögur village was a significant part of their expedition, and it provided valuable insights into the culture and way of life of this unique people. The Sarö Yögur people have a rich and fascinating culture that is worth studying and learning more about. The team's observations and findings can help to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of this little-known people and their way of life. 

In conclusion, the team's visit to the Sarö Yögur village was a unique and fascinating experience that provided valuable insights into the culture and way of life of this little-known people. The Sarö Yögur people have a distinct culture and tradition that is separate from the Chinese and Mongolian cultures, and their language, clothing, and customs are all unique and reflect their history and origins. The team's observations and findings can help to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of this fascinating people and their way of life. 

The Sarö Yögur people's way of life is simple and traditional, and they have a strong sense of community and tradition.

Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a unique language and culture, with some similarities to Turkish and Khirgis, but they have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history or legends. The team stayed in the village temple, which was small and poorly used, and learned about the local administration and way of life, including the lamas' roles in education and cattle-keeping. The villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, which is collected by an officer stationed in a nearby town.
