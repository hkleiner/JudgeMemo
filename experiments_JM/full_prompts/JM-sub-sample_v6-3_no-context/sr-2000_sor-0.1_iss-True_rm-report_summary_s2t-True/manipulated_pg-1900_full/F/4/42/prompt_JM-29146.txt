You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is stranded on the planet Irwadi after the government planetarizes the Interstellar Transfer Service. He meets a beautiful Earthgirl named Margot Dennison, who claims to have a ship and offers him a job to take her to Centauri. Ramsey agrees, and they set out to prepare the ship for departure. Along the way, they are joined by a Vegan girl named Vardin, who is fleeing from the Irwadian Security Police.

As they work on the ship, Ramsey discovers a letter in Margot's apartment that hints at a mysterious and powerful secret. The letter, written by Margot's father, mentions a pre-human ancestor called "proto-man" who discovered hyper-space and used it to colonize the galaxy. Margot believes that the secret to hyper-space lies on a planet in the middle of the Irwadi-Earth hyper-space route.

Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin finally depart from Irwadi and head towards the mysterious planet. As they approach the planet, they experience strange occurrences, including a vision of a chess game between Margot and an unknown entity. Upon landing on the planet, they find a black rectangular object that Margot believes is a matter-transmitter.

However, their journey is interrupted by the arrival of Garr Symm, the Chief of Irwadi Security, and his men. Symm is determined to claim the matter-transmitter for himself and use its power to control the galaxy. Ramsey and Margot engage in a struggle, and Symm eventually jumps into the black box, which transforms him into a caveman-like creature.

Vardin, who is revealed to be a member of the proto-man species, explains that her ancestors created human life and colonized the galaxy, but lost control of their discovery. She tells Ramsey to take Margot and leave, and that she will continue to watch over the galaxy as a guardian. Ramsey and Margot depart, and as they fly away, Margot confesses her love for Ramsey. The two decide to explore the galaxy together, leaving their pasts behind.

The story explores themes of power, control, and the responsible use of advanced technology. The character of Vardin serves as a guardian, ensuring that the secrets of hyper-space are not misused by humanity. The novel also touches on the idea of ancestral memories and the collective unconscious, as embodied by the proto-man species. Overall, the story is a thrilling adventure that combines elements of science fiction, action, and romance.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8030):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when Englander gets back on his feet. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Margot plans to take Vardin with her, but Ramsey refuses, and a standoff ensues, with Margot threatening to use an m.g. gun.
