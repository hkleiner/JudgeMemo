# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals attempting to capture Richmond, none had succeeded. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan came closest in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of the city. The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the Union failing to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia.

In the West, the Union had more success, capturing Vicksburg and Chattanooga, and throwing open the gateway to Georgia. The beginning of 1864 found the Northern armies in a stronger position, with greater resources and a possibility of splitting the Southern states. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given responsibility for all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction, leaving execution to Maj. Gen. George G. Meade.

The Union plan called for a two-pronged attack, with Grant targeting Richmond and Petersburg, and Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman targeting Atlanta and the Army of Tennessee. The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast. On June 15, 1864, the XVIII Corps launched a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line, capturing a significant portion of it. However, the Confederates were able to regroup and hold their position.

The Battle of Petersburg began on June 15, with the Union army attempting to capture the city. Despite initial successes, the Confederates were able to hold their ground, and the Union army suffered heavy casualties. The battle continued for several days, with the Union army attempting to break through the Confederate lines. On June 18, the Confederates withdrew to a new line, and the Union army was unable to break through.

The Union army then began to dig in and prepare for a siege, with Grant ordering the construction of fortifications and the development of siege tactics. The Confederates, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, were able to hold their position, but the Union army continued to apply pressure. In July 1864, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate lines, including the Battle of the Crater, which was a failed attempt to break through the lines using a mine.

The Union army continued to apply pressure, with Grant ordering a series of attacks on the Confederate lines. In August 1864, the Union army captured the Weldon Railroad, a crucial supply line for the Confederates. The Confederates launched a series of counterattacks, but were unable to retake the railroad. The Union army continued to push the Confederates back, capturing more territory and applying pressure on the city of Petersburg.

In March 1865, Lee launched a desperate attack on the Union lines, known as the Battle of Fort Stedman. The attack was repulsed, and the Union army continued to push the Confederates back. On April 1, 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate lines, including the Battle of Five Forks. The Confederates were defeated, and Lee was forced to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond.

On April 2, 1865, the Union army launched a final attack on the Confederate lines, breaking through and capturing the city of Petersburg. The Confederates retreated, and the Union army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked a significant turning point in the war, and the Union army's victory ultimately led to the defeat of the Confederacy.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8192):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy called for a two-pronged attack, with General Ulysses S. Grant leading the effort against Richmond and Petersburg, while General William T. Sherman marched towards Atlanta. Grant's army engaged in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but was unable to defeat the Confederate army, leading him to shift his focus to Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key step towards ultimately abandoning Richmond and ending the war.

Section section_02 (Chars 8193–16702):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads, making it a vital supply point for the Confederate capital, Richmond. The city's defenses, known as the "Dimmock Line," were constructed in 1862-1863, but its length and size made it difficult to defend with the available troops. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates were forced to withdraw and establish new defensive positions, but they were able to hold off the Union advances with the help of reinforcements from General Lee's command. The battle raged on for several days, with intense fighting and heavy losses on both sides, but the Confederates were ultimately able to maintain control of the city.

Section Summary: The Union Army's initial attempt to capture Petersburg failed, resulting in 10,000 casualties and the failure to break the Confederate defense line. Despite this, the Union Army was able to cut two railroads leading into the city and gain control of several roads. The Union Army then shifted its strategy to a siege, with the goal of capturing the city through a process of attrition that would last for nine months. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including coal miners, devised a plan to dig a tunnel under the Confederate lines and blow up a key fortification, known as Pegram's Salient. The tunnel, which was completed on July 30, 1864, was a remarkable feat of engineering that used a ventilating chimney to supply fresh air to the diggers.

Section section_04 (Chars 25003–33545):
Section Summary: Union soldiers built a mine under the Confederate lines, using a ventilation system to remove bad air and bring in fresh air. The mine was completed on July 23 and charged with 8,000 pounds of black powder, which was detonated on July 30, killing or wounding at least 278 Confederate troops and creating a large crater. The Union army's subsequent attack was delayed and disorganized, allowing the Confederates to regroup and counterattack, ultimately forcing the Union troops back into the crater. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederates were able to repel several Union charges and eventually gained control of the crater, causing many Union soldiers to surrender or retreat. The battle was a decisive Confederate victory, with the Union army suffering heavy casualties and failing to achieve its objectives.

Section section_05 (Chars 33546–42070):
Section Summary: After the failed Union attempt to capture Petersburg through the Crater, Grant shifted his focus to extending his siege lines and cutting off Lee's supply lines. The Union army successfully captured the Weldon Railroad on August 18, which was a significant blow to the Confederates, as it limited their ability to transport supplies. Despite some Confederate victories, including a surprise attack on Hancock's II Corps, the Union army continued to push westward, capturing key territory and extending their lines. The Battle of Peebles' Farm in late September and early October further pushed the Union lines westward, although they were stopped short of the Southside Railroad. The Union army's relentless advance ultimately led to a thinner Confederate defense line, making it increasingly difficult for Lee to maintain his position.

Section section_06 (Chars 42071–50423):
Section Summary: The Union army's attempts to encircle Petersburg continued, with the Battle of Hatcher's Run in February 1865 being the latest effort to cut off the city. Despite some successes, the Union army was unable to fully encircle the city, and the Confederate army was forced to lengthen its defenses, which now stretched over 37 miles. The prolonged siege of Petersburg had taken a toll on both armies, with soldiers on both sides experiencing boredom, hunger, and hardship. The Confederates were particularly struggling with food shortages and desertion, with their effective troop strength dwindling to just over 56,000 by March 1865. The siege would eventually come to an end in April 1865, when Union forces broke through the outer defenses of the city, leading to the evacuation of Petersburg and the eventual surrender of Confederate forces.

Section section_07 (Chars 50424–59080):
Section Summary: By mid-March 1865, the Civil War was nearing its climax, with Lee's forces dwindling to 55,000, while Grant had over 150,000 troops at his disposal. Lee, facing a dire military situation, considered three options: negotiating peace terms, retreating to unite with Johnston, or attacking Grant's forces. He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union fort near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through Grant's lines and facilitate a retreat. The attack, which took place on March 25, initially succeeded, but was ultimately repelled by Union forces, resulting in heavy Confederate casualties, with over 4,000 killed, wounded, or captured. The failed attack left Lee with only one option: to retreat, a decision that would seal the fate of the Confederacy.

Section Summary: As the weather improved, Grant planned to launch a final attack on the Confederate line protecting Richmond and Petersburg, focusing on the extreme right flank near Five Forks. Lee, aware of the Union buildup, sent troops to defend the area, but they were outnumbered and outgunned. On April 1, Sheridan's cavalry and Warren's infantry attacked and defeated the Confederates at Five Forks, capturing over 3,200 prisoners and cutting off Lee's supply lines. This victory put Grant's troops in position to break through Lee's defenses and ultimately led to the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond. The fall of Petersburg began on April 2, with a Union assault that broke through the Confederate lines, and by midday, the city was surrounded, prompting the Confederate government to flee.

Section Summary: After months of fighting, the Confederate line finally rested on the bank of the Appomattox River, and General Lee knew he had to hold an inner line until nightfall to allow for a retreat from Petersburg. The defenders of Fort Gregg put up a stubborn fight, but were eventually overwhelmed, and the Confederate lines were breached. Despite a desperate defense, Lee and other Southern leaders realized that all hope of retaining Petersburg and Richmond was lost, and they began a retreat to Amelia Court House. The Union army took possession of Petersburg on April 3, and Richmond surrendered shortly after, marking a significant turning point in the war. The fall of Petersburg ultimately led to the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House, and the end of the Civil War.
