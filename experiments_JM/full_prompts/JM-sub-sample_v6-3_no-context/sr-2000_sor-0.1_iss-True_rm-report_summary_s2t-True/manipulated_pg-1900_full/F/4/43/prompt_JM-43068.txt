# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet was a prominent painter of peasant life, born on October 4, 1814, in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy. He came from a peasant stock and was raised in a humble environment, which later influenced his art. Millet's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was encouraged by his family to pursue his passion for art. He began drawing at a young age and was eventually sent to Cherbourg to study under a local painter, Mouchel.

Millet's talent was recognized, and he was awarded a pension to study in Paris. However, he faced significant challenges in the city, including poverty and criticism from the art establishment. Despite these obstacles, he continued to develop his unique style, which was influenced by the Old Masters, particularly Andrea Mantegna. Millet's art was characterized by its simplicity, sincerity, and profound understanding of the human condition.

In 1840, Millet returned to Paris and began to establish himself as a painter. He became friends with other artists, including Charles Jacque and Diaz, who shared his passion for art and his commitment to depicting the lives of ordinary people. Millet's paintings often featured peasants engaged in everyday activities, such as farming, shepherding, and gleaning. His most famous works include "The Angelus," "The Gleaners," and "The Man with the Hoe."

Millet's art was not widely recognized during his lifetime, and he faced significant financial struggles. However, he continued to paint, driven by his passion for his art and his desire to capture the essence of peasant life. In 1850, he moved to Barbizon, a small village on the outskirts of Paris, where he lived a simple life and focused on his art. Millet's time in Barbizon was marked by significant artistic growth, and he produced some of his most famous works during this period.

Despite his struggles, Millet's art eventually gained recognition, and he became a leading figure in the Barbizon school. His paintings were praised for their simplicity, sincerity, and profound understanding of the human condition. Millet's influence can be seen in the work of many other artists, including Segantini, who was inspired by his example. Today, Millet is recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life, and his art continues to inspire and move people around the world.

Millet's personal life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he remained committed to his art and his values. He was a simple man who lived a simple life, and his art reflects his profound respect for the ordinary people and the natural world. Millet's legacy is a testament to the power of art to capture the essence of the human experience and to inspire future generations. He died on January 20, 1875, but his art continues to live on, a reminder of the beauty and dignity of peasant life. Millet's drawings and etchings are also highly regarded for their spontaneity and emotional intensity. Overall, Millet's life and art are a powerful reminder of the importance of staying true to one's vision and values, even in the face of adversity.
