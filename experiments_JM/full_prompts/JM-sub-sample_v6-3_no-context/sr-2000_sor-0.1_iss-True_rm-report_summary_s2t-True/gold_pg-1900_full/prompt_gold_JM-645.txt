# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator, a literary critic, recalls his encounter with George Corvick, who had been tasked with reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel. Corvick was breathless and worried, having received a telegram from Gwendolen Erme, and asked the narrator to prepare an article on Vereker's work. The narrator was eager to meet Vereker, who was to be at Lady Jane's house, and wrote a review of his book. However, when he met Vereker, he was disappointed to find that his review had not impressed him.

Vereker revealed to the narrator that his books contained a hidden meaning, a "figure in the carpet," which he had never explicitly stated. The narrator was intrigued and tried to understand the meaning, but Vereker advised him to give up. The narrator told Corvick about his conversation with Vereker, and Corvick became obsessed with uncovering the hidden meaning.

Corvick went to India and eventually discovered the secret, but before he could share it with the narrator, he died in an accident. The narrator was left with the mystery unsolved and became increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth. He tried to get information from Corvick's widow, Gwendolen, but she refused to share it, saying it was her life.

The narrator continued to pursue the mystery, even after Gwendolen married Drayton Deane. He met Deane and tried to get him to reveal the secret, but Deane claimed he didn't know anything. The narrator realized that Gwendolen had not shared the secret with her husband, and he was left with the feeling that he would never uncover the truth.

Years later, the narrator met Deane again and told him the whole story. Deane was surprised and intrigued, and the narrator realized that he had been mistaken in thinking that Deane knew the secret. The two men commiserated about their shared obsession, and the narrator felt a sense of consolation in knowing that he was not alone in his quest for the truth.

The narrator's obsession with the mystery had become an all-consuming force in his life, and he was left with the feeling that he would never be able to uncover the truth. The story ends with the narrator and Deane sharing their frustration and curiosity, both still searching for the elusive "figure in the carpet." The narrator's experience had taught him that some secrets may be too well-hidden to ever be revealed.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7852):
Section Summary: The narrator, a young writer, is given the task of reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel by his friend George Corvick, who is unable to do it himself due to a personal emergency. The narrator is eager to meet Vereker, a renowned author, and sees this as an opportunity to make a good impression. After writing the review, the narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unsure if he has read the review and is hesitant to bring it up. Vereker's pleasant and affable nature makes the narrator want him to read the review, which he believes does justice to his work. Ultimately, it is Lady Jane who brings attention to the review, praising it and potentially doing for the narrator what he couldn't do for himself.

Section Summary: The narrator's review of Hugh Vereker's book was praised by Lady Jane, but when Vereker himself commented on it, he called it "the usual twaddle", which hurt the narrator's feelings.

Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the true point of his work. He confided in the narrator, sharing his feelings of being a failure despite his success, and the two connected over their shared love of literature. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kindness and sincerity, and his initial hurt was replaced by a deeper understanding and appreciation of the author.

Section Summary: The narrator visited Vereker, who seemed indifferent to the topic of the hidden meaning in his work, and the narrator began to doubt its significance. The narrator then spoke to George Corvick, who was determined to uncover the meaning with his partner Gwendolen, and they were both enthusiastic about the challenge. Corvick and Gwendolen were deeply invested in the pursuit, pouring over Vereker's work and discussing it at length, with Corvick convinced that he would eventually uncover the truth. The narrator was skeptical, but Corvick was undeterred, driven by his passion for the mystery and his confidence in his own abilities.

Section Summary: The narrator had lost touch with George Corvick, who had left England for India to work as a special commissioner for a provincial paper. Corvick's departure was a surprise, and the narrator inferred that he was motivated by a desire to make money, possibly to win over his former fiancée, Gwendolen Erme. However, Corvick had revealed that he was no longer engaged to Gwendolen, and the narrator suspected that she may have estranged him. Meanwhile, the narrator's curiosity about the hidden meaning in Vereker's works had been rekindled, and he was eager to learn if Corvick had made any progress in uncovering it. Gwendolen eventually shared news with the narrator that Corvick had sent a telegram from Bombay, claiming to have discovered Vereker's secret, and she was overjoyed, believing that he had finally uncovered the truth.
