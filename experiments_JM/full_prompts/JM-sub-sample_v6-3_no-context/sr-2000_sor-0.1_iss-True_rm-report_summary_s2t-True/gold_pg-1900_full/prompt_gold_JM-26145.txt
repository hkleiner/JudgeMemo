# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets are letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters reveal the political situation in Western Asia, with various kingdoms and city-states vying for power.

Amenophis III was a powerful pharaoh who expanded Egypt's borders, but his son Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new religion and moved the capital to Tell el Amarna. The new religion, centered on the worship of the sun disk Aten, was seen as heretical by the traditional priests of Amon. Akhenaten's reforms led to a decline in Egypt's power and influence in Western Asia.

The tablets contain letters from various Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters reveal the complex web of alliances and rivalries between the different kingdoms. The kings of Mitani and Babylonia sought to maintain good relations with Egypt, but also pursued their own interests and sought to expand their territories.

The tablets also contain letters from Egyptian vassals in Canaan, who reported on the political situation and requested help from the pharaoh. The vassals were often at odds with each other, and the pharaoh's responses were sometimes inadequate or ineffective. The letters reveal a picture of a complex and unstable political landscape, with various factions and interest groups vying for power.

One of the most notable correspondents was Aziru, a powerful vassal who sought to expand his territory and influence. He was eventually summoned to the pharaoh's court, but managed to evade punishment and maintain his power. Other notable figures included Rib-Addi of Gebal, who complained about the actions of Aziru and sought help from the pharaoh.

The tablets also contain references to the Habiri, a group of people who were seen as a threat to the stability of the region. The Habiri were likely a group of nomadic or semi-nomadic people who were seeking to expand their territory and influence. The tablets also mention the Hittites, who were a powerful kingdom in central Anatolia and were expanding their territory into Syria.

The Tell el Amarna period came to an end with the death of Akhenaten in 1370 B.C. The city of Tell el Amarna was abandoned, and the tablets were buried in the earth, where they remained until their discovery in the 19th century. The tablets provide a unique window into the politics and society of the ancient Near East, and offer insights into the complex web of alliances and rivalries that shaped the region. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource that sheds light on a fascinating and complex period in ancient history.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8551):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to the Egyptian court and administration. The tablets also revealed the complex system of writing and diplomacy used by the ancient Egyptians and their counterparts in Asia, with scribes using various scripts and languages to communicate.

Section section_02 (Chars 8551–17090):
Section Summary: King Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new religious doctrine that emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, or "Aten", which led to a conflict with the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes. The king's efforts to reform the old religion were met with resistance, and he eventually moved the court to a new city called Akhet-Aten, where he established a new capital and promoted his new doctrine. The Asiatic provinces under Egyptian rule enjoyed self-government, but were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute disputes, and the immigration of Bedawìn tribes, which led to a state of chaos and instability. The king's officials, such as Yanhamu, wielded significant power and influence over the vassal chiefs, who often struggled to pay tribute and maintain peace in their territories. The situation was further complicated by the arrival of nomadic tribes, including the Sutu and Habiri, who encroached upon Egyptian territory and formed alliances with some of the vassal chiefs, exacerbating the conflicts in the region.

Section section_03 (Chars 17091–25414):
Section Summary: In Palestine, the Habiri's seizure of strongholds and the Bedawîn's unrest created an opportunity for ambitious vassals to establish independent kingdoms, taking advantage of the Egyptian government's weakness. The Egyptian government, despite being well-informed, took a middle course by sending inadequate military expeditions, which sometimes restored peace but ultimately failed to check serious hostilities. The knowledge of Egypt's distance and the Pharaoh's exalted status led Syrian and Canaanite chiefs to defy their suzerain, robbing ambassadors and caravans, and intercepting gifts. The letters from Asiatic kings, such as Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relations, with the Egyptian king hesitant to give away his daughters in marriage due to their perceived divine status. The correspondence between these kings showcases the intricacies of ancient Near Eastern politics, with alliances, marriages, and gift exchanges playing a crucial role in maintaining power and influence.

Section section_04 (Chars 25415–33603):
Section Summary: Tushratta, the king of Mitani, wrote to Nimmuria, the king of Egypt, detailing his struggles to ascend to the throne and his military victories. Tushratta's letters to Nimmuria were filled with requests for gold and declarations of affection, but his tone changed over time to become more greedy and entitled. After Nimmuria's death, Tushratta's relationship with the new king, Akhenaten (also known as Napkhuria), deteriorated, and Akhenaten's reckless and impolitic behavior strained Egypt's relationships with other kingdoms, including Babylonia. Akhenaten's actions, such as neglecting to send sympathy to the Babylonian king during an illness and sending gold to the Assyrian prince, were seen as breaches of etiquette and provoked retaliation from the Babylonians. This marked a significant shift in Egypt's foreign relations, as Akhenaten's policies led to unrest and instability in the region.

Section section_05 (Chars 33603–41817):
Section Summary: The prince of Alashia wrote letters to the Egyptian king, mostly of a business nature, and one of these letters contains the first historic mention of the plague. The ruler of Alashia had to deal with diplomatic issues, including a breach of etiquette by Napkhuria, who sent an embassy with an improper greeting. Tushratta, the king of Mitani, exchanged letters with Napkhuria, the new Egyptian king, regarding a promise made by Napkhuria's father, Nimmuria, to send golden statuettes. Tushratta insisted on receiving the statuettes, but Napkhuria sent wooden models instead, leading to a dispute between the two kings. The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Egyptian governors and officials, make up the majority of the correspondence and demonstrate a different tone and form of address compared to the letters between royal brothers.

Section section_06 (Chars 41818–49801):
Section Summary: The Tell el Amarna archives provide a unique store of historical material, revealing the doings of vassal chiefs and their interactions with the Egyptian court. Aziru, prefect of the land of the Amorites, was a particularly powerful and troublesome chief who sought to found an independent kingdom, seizing territories and forming alliances with Egyptian officials. The city of Tunip and Rib-Addi of Gebal sent complaints to Pharaoh about Aziru's aggressive actions, but their pleas for help were often ignored or delayed. Despite his cunning and ability to evade punishment, Aziru was eventually summoned to the Egyptian court and arrested, bringing an end to his disruptive activities. The archives suggest that while Aziru's actions were problematic, they also brought a measure of stability to the region, as he was able to unify various factions and impose order through his military campaigns.

Section section_07 (Chars 49802–57668):
Section Summary: Abdikheba, the captain of Jerusalem, wrote to the king complaining of hostilities from neighboring chiefs, including Milki-El and Tagi, who were aided by the Habiri, likely referring to the Hebrews. The Habiri were already present in the "Promised Land" and had established themselves in certain areas, including Shechem and Mount Ephraim. The Egyptian system of government was blamed for the instability in the region, with petty princes often left to fend for themselves and receiving little support from their suzerain. The letters from various princes and officials, including Abi-milki of Tyre, provide insight into the politics and relationships of the time, with many seeking to curry favor with the king and report on the activities of their neighbors. The tablets also mention various cities and towns in the region, including Jerusalem, Sidon, and Gaza, and provide a glimpse into the complex web of alliances and rivalries that existed at the time.

Section Summary: The letters discussed in this section provide insight into the manners and customs of the time, as well as geographical details. They include correspondence from various Syrian chiefs, such as Yabitiri and Itakama, who express their loyalty to the king and request assistance in dealing with rebellious cities and rival leaders. The letters also mention various locations, including Gaza, Joppa, and Ugarit, which was an Egyptian possession in Asia, and provide information about the relationships between different cities and leaders. Additionally, the section includes letters from women, such as the wife of Milki-El, who was struggling to cope with the Habiri while her husband was away in Egypt. Overall, the letters offer a glimpse into the complex web of alliances, rivalries, and power struggles in the ancient Near East.

Section section_09 (Chars 65313–70239):
Section Summary: The daughter of Napkhuria sent a letter to her father via a special envoy, but unfortunately, the letter is mostly illegible. During the Tell el Amarna period, Egypt's authority in Asia was weakened, despite King Napkhuria's religious reform, and the Habiri people continued to attack and expand their territory. The kingdom of Mitani, which had once been a powerful state, was on the verge of collapse, threatened by the rising Hittite empire and Babylonians. Mitani's king, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, but the kingdom eventually vanished and was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms and Assyrian rule. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also met a swift end, with Napkhuria's death in 1370 B.C. and the subsequent destruction of his city at Tell el Amarna by the champions of Amon.
