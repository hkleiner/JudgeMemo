    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violin maker, and his nephew Davy. Anthony is reading a story about Paganini with Davy's help. The story highlights Anthony's exceptional talent and dedication to his craft. As a child, Anthony was fascinated by music and spent most of his time outdoors, exploring nature and learning about the world around him.

Anthony's mother was a widow who owned a small farm, and he was her only son. He hated school and was considered lazy by the villagers, but he was actually passionate about learning and discovery. Anthony spent his childhood taking apart and reassembling musical instruments, and by the time he was 15, he had become skilled in repairing and making violins.

The story then introduces Lyddy Ann Butterfield, a disfigured and reclusive woman who has inherited a house and a small income from her aunt. Lyddy is a kind and gentle soul who has been isolated from the world due to her appearance. She is drawn to Anthony's music and begins to visit him, helping with household chores and caring for Davy when he falls ill.

As Lyddy spends more time with Anthony and Davy, she begins to open up and share her thoughts and feelings. Anthony, who is blind, sees beyond Lyddy's physical appearance and appreciates her inner beauty and kindness. The two form a deep connection, and Anthony eventually proposes to Lyddy, who accepts.

The story jumps forward in time, and Anthony and Lyddy are now married. They sit in their apple orchard, surrounded by nature and beauty. Anthony is working on a new composition, using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs to create music. Lyddy is sewing a basket, symbolizing her hopes and dreams for their future together.

Davy, now a young boy, is reading Shakespeare and provides feedback on Anthony's music. Lyddy and Anthony share a moment of tenderness, and the story concludes with a sense of peace, love, and new beginnings. The apple orchard, filled with blooming flowers and the sounds of nature, serves as a symbol of their happiness and harmony.
