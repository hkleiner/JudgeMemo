# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Text: -THE STREET OF PRECIOUS PEARLS-


From the women of China I have learned that World Fellowship is not
alone an intellectual concept but a natural law in accordance with
which the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic beat of the
Universe.

To the women of America I dedicate this story of the life of my Chinese
friend and teacher: it is as accurate as she with her small store of
English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could
make it.

Turning off from the Da Mou Lui or the stuff, the name
common to the main street in Chinese towns and villages, there is to be
found, if one seeks diligently for it, the Street of Precious Pearls.

Always it is a side street. Often it is so narrow that two sedan chairs
cannot pass. At those times of the day when the shadows are long there
is no golden sunshine reflected from the cobblestones that pave the
street. But I have found, for I like to visit the little shops on side
streets, that the more precious jewels glow with a warmer brilliancy
when the day outside is dark.

It is the street of greatest importance to every Chinese girl. On
it will be bought her dowry jewels. Ancient custom rules that the
betrothed bride shall convert the wealth she inherits from her father’s
household into precious stones. And so it is here on the Street of
Precious Pearls that her inheritance is spent, lest by bringing money,
as such, into her husband’s household she reflect upon the ability of
her new family to support her.

Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet as her chair-bearers turned into the
street at a low spoken word from her grandmother. She was third in the
procession. Madame Yen rode first, directly behind the house servant
who walked ahead, breaking a way through the crowded Big Horse Street
and into the quieter Street of Precious Pearls, crying, “Lend light,
lend light.” Next to Madame Yen came Kuei Ping’s mother, and bringing
up the rear was a fourth chair in which was carried a distant relative,
by name Chang An, who held a place in the household a trifle higher
than that of a trusted servant.

Following the swaying tapestried box-like chairs that marked the
presence of her mother and grandmother, Kuei Ping leaned forward in
her seat, peering through the horizontal aperture in front of her
with brightening eyes. The Street of Precious Pearls was quiet and
cool. Moss clung to the bases of buildings and the grasses that had
ventured up through the paving stones were worn away only in a central
path and in patches in front of entrance ways. Now and then someone
came from beneath one of the heavy curtain-like doors that closed a
shop, and slipped along the silent street, but the padded shoes of the
pedestrian made no noise on the grass-covered stones. Here was a peace
and quiet akin to the hush of the Mission Church, Kuei Ping caught
herself thinking, and then flushed at what she thought her irreverence
in comparing the gorgeous pageantry of the procession as she saw it
silhouetted against the dust-dulled gold lacquer of the shops with the
aesthetic simplicity of the Chapel.

They had traversed more than half the entire length of the street when
Madame Yen’s chair came to a stop before a shop with rich filigree
carvings and double entrance doors of heavy velvet with brass frames.

At the sound of their approach, two attendants of the door stepped
forward and swung it wide, that the chair-bearers might carry the
ladies into a tiny inner courtyard before they need dismount, saying as
they bowed, “Honorable ladies, enter the humble shop.” Thereupon, the
narrower inner curtains of the shop itself were held open and Madame
Yen and her relatives, bowing low, returned the formal greeting and
passed within.

At the entry of customers, numerous clerks and underlings, so it seemed
to Kuei Ping, swarmed forward with greetings and formal offerings of
stools upon which to sit and with cups of tea to drink. The head of the
shop and his partners flicked their long-stemmed pipes from sleepy lips
and rose, as though from deep meditation, struggling a bit with the
light that would penetrate into their eyes, even in the darkened room,
as they bowed, offering the courtesy of “the miserable place to the
pleasure of their honorable guests.”

The eldest among them with his own hand took from an attendant each cup
of tea as it was brought and offered it with a low bow to his guest.

Kuei Ping, lifting her gaze now and then from the floor, caught a glint
of joy of the coming bargain in the corners of the shrewd old dealer’s
mouth and in her grandmother’s eyes, even in the midst of courtesy and
greeting.

Rich jewels were brought forth, for Kuei Ping’s own grandfather was
a well known silk merchant and the coming alliance with an official
family was not beyond the knowledge of Wong Lui, dealer in jewels.

Madame Yen gave but a sweeping glance to the first display placed
before her. Kuei Ping had slipped into the background, but her mother
and the relative looked over the jewels and then up at Madame Yen as if
to agree that they were not worthy of attention. Wong Lui held various
secret conferences with his head clerk, and boys slipped away into dark
recesses to bring forth rarer treasures. Madame Yen and her daughter
preferred pearls, and from the mysterious caverns of the shop they were
brought. Exquisite gems, each wrapped separately, were removed from
their covers and glowed in a wondrous heap on the dark velvet cover of
the teakwood table.

Kuei Ping liked rich warm color but she liked it best subdued in the
luminous pearls. She was a favorite with her grandmother and this
preference was no secret to Madame Yen who placed her chair now, as the
hour grew on, that Kuei Ping might get the full value of the beauty
of the fabulous heap. Carefully, one by one, the preferred gems were
separated from those of lesser beauty by the two women. And still at
intervals, as though he had just awakened to some almost forgotten
knowledge, Wong Lui would cease caressing his drooping moustaches with
his slender hands and wave a clerk away to bring even rarer treasure.

But all things come to end in time and these mysterious errands grew
farther and farther apart and finally ceased. Wong Lui had placed his
best before them. Kuei Ping from under her modestly lowered lashes
caught glimpses of bright eyes that glowed from the darkness of the
inner rooms, the curious little clerks and underlings who peered
through the dividing parchment, eagerly following the tableau in the
center of the shop.

Not until the selected heap was before her did Madame Yen speak of
price and then only as a question. Kuei Ping had seen her grandmother
bargain before and so she scarce drew her attention away from the
lustrous heap of jewels even to listen. Wong Lui, too, was seasoned at
the game which both dearly loved and so with the skill of chess players
they moved slowly, each toward his goal, each carefully measuring the
other’s power to yield from his quoted price. At intervals, when the
conflict might have grown a trifle sharp, cups of tea were served.

Kuei Ping, resting her eyes upon the pearls so soon to be hers, drank
deep draughts of their beauty. Impelled by their drawing power she
gathered a handful of them up in her soft pink palm, unmindful of the
bargainers but not unnoted by them. The quick eyes of each had counted
the number and the face of Madame Yen had softened as she looked upon
the girl. Wong Lui had noted that also and put it down in his favor in
the game before them.

The girl, holding the jewels thus in her hand that she might feel their
nearness, saw them glow into warmer color as she held them, as though
her touch breathed life into them. In after years she was to think
often of the care with which they had been selected and to pay homage
in memory to the experience and knowledge which made possible that rare
power of choice, for even Wong Lui, seasoned dealer in jewels, had
shown respect for Madame Yen’s judgment.

With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked
physically, Kuei Ping was back in memory, as she was so often these
days, at the little mission school where she had been sent when she
could go no farther in lessons with her brothers at home. This too had
been an indulgence upon the part of her family, gained by her nearness
to her grandmother.

It was graduation day. This was the memory she conned over most often.

Kuei Ping had stood first in her class and when the exercises were over
she had stolen away into the garden to bid it a last farewell, with
the small remembrance reward that had been given to her clasped in her
hand. Ever since that day Kuei Ping had worn it next to her heart.

She could feel its hard edge now as she sat holding the pearls. In
memory the fragrant perfume of the la thing roses at the end of the
walk drifted out to her again, she recalled the crunching sound Miss
Porter’s stiff foreign shoes had made as she came down the path, and
the tenseness of the principal’s voice as she had spoken, asking the stuff to come and sit in the arbor and talk with her.

From the first day Kuei Ping entered school she had worshipped the tall
golden-haired American girl in the shrine of her heart as an Angel of
Freedom. While they sat in the arbor she had held Kuei Ping’s hand
in the foreign way. Kuei Ping thrilled to the memory of that touch
more than to the glow of the pearls. Miss Porter built for the girl
who listened at her side that afternoon, a dream bridge of words that
connected the road of Kuei Ping’s life with that strange land called
the United States, where men and women had equal opportunity, and from
which the Chinese girl with her brilliant mind trained to new ways
might return to give service to her own country women. Kuei Ping had
held her breath lest she lose a word while Miss Porter talked, quiet at
first, carried away by the marvel of the opportunity, then very still
because she knew its impossibility. For at the spring holidays Madame
Yen had told her granddaughter of the plans for her marriage and had
given her the engagement gifts from the Chia household that had been
kept these two years now, waiting until she should be finished with
school.

Her family loved her. Kuei Ping had known that from the first moment
she opened her eyes and smiled into her mother’s face. They awaited
her return home and her fulfillment of their plans for her. There were
ties that bound her a part of the whole which made up the unit of her
family, bonds that could not be pushed aside with the brusqueness that
made possible the spirit of freedom that lit the eyes of the American
girl. And yet it was this spirit of freedom and of service in the wider
ways of life to which she had built the secret shrine within her heart.

It was a hard conflict, but Kuei Ping’s decision was reached before she
had lifted her quiet eyes to thank Miss Porter and say that she could
not go.

The latter had been a trifle curt. Kuei Ping had wept bitter tears
over it since, because she had failed the person she admired most in
all the world. The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West
understand each other had stilled her lips from any sharing of her
feeling about her home, or any repetition to her grandmother of the
conversation in the garden. The engagement bracelets in the bureau in
her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress
were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life.

Madame Yen reached over now to Kuei Ping for the pearls she had taken
from the table, that they might be put in the same case with the
others. The bargain was closed. Fresh cups of tea were brought forth
and refused, Madame Yen and her relatives saying over and over as they
were bowed out, “We have squandered your valuable time,” and Wong Lui
and his attendants begging them not to waste their breath in courtesy
for his humble shop.

Outside, the chair-bearers, trained to patience by long hours, waited.
