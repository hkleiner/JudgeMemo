You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8002):
Section Summary: The story begins with a boy named Davy reading to his uncle, Anthony Croft, who is blind. Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his instrument. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he recalls his own childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in the outdoors and music. Anthony's love for music was evident even as a young boy, where he would create makeshift instruments and treasure a tuning fork given to him by a singing teacher. The scene ends with Anthony playing his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony and richness, as he loses himself in the music.

Section section_02 (Chars 8002–11542):
Section Summary: The teacher in Edgewood often struggled to keep her students engaged, especially on hot afternoons, and Anthony, a curious and restless boy, would sometimes sneak out of the window to escape the monotony. Despite being considered the laziest boy in the village, Anthony was actually driven by a desire to learn and understand the world around him, constantly asking "why" and "how" about the natural phenomena he observed. He spent much of his time exploring the woods, educating himself, and gathering knowledge about the local flora and fauna. Anthony's mother acknowledged that he had a wealth of "useless information" about the natural world, including where to find rare flowers and how to imitate the songs of wild birds. Through his self-directed learning, Anthony developed a deep connection with nature and a sense of wonder that fueled his curiosity and love of learning.
