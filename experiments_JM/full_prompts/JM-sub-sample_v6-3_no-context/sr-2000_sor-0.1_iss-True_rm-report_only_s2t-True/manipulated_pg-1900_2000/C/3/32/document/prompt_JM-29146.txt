You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8003):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government has taken this step to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships, and will only allow Irwadian pilots to transport it. Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene, and he has a few hundred credits to tide him over. The move is expected to give Irwadi control over the titanium trade and allow them to set their own prices.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16069):
Section Summary: Chind Ramar, the Irwadi Security Officer, has ordered the crew and passengers of the Polaris to assemble, announcing that the planet has been "planetarized" and all outworld ships are stranded indefinitely. This means that only Irwadian pilots will be allowed to transport titanium, a vital metal, through hyper-space, giving Irwadi control over the market. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is among those affected and has surrendered his pilot license, but he's not too concerned as he has some savings to tide him over. An Earthgirl, who has the ability to read minds, has also left the ship and is heading to the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, trying not to panic. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially and worried about supporting his family, and they discuss their uncertain futures on the planet.

Section section_03 (Chars 16070–21965):
Section Summary: Jase Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to make ends meet, and gives him 375 credits to support his family. Englander is grateful, but Ramsey tells him not to worry about paying him back. After leaving Englander's place, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is left with only three credits. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, wearing flashy jewelry, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent.
