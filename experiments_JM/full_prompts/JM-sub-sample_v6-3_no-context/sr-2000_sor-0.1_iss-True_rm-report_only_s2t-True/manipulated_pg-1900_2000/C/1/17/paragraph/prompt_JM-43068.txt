You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8839):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is considered one of the greatest painters of peasant life, alongside artists like Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, capturing the everyday life of simple peasants with a profound and sympathetic rendering. His paintings, such as those depicting the angelus, convey the struggles and hardships of peasant life, as well as the importance of religion in their daily lives. Millet's unique style, developed through his simple and earnest life, is marked by subtleties of line and tone that set him apart from his contemporaries. His work is a testament to the enduring power of art that conveys a message, rather than mere technical brilliance.

Section section_02 (Chars 8839–13972):
Section Summary: The section begins by mentioning a systematic program of translation and publication that has made Bahá’u’lláh's writings accessible to people worldwide in over 800 languages. However, the majority of the section focuses on the life and work of artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, discussing his friendships, weaknesses, and artistic style. In contrast, the section also describes the work of Jean-François Millet, a philosopher-painter who depicted the everyday life of peasants with simplicity and depth. Millet's paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen," convey the loneliness and hardship of rural labor, showcasing his unique perspective on the human experience. Overall, the section explores the lives and artistic visions of these two distinct individuals, Reynolds and Millet.
