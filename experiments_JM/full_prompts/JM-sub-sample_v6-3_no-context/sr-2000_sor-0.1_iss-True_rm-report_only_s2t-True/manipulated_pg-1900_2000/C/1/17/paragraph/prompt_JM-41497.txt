You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8673):
Section Summary: The chapter discusses the life and work of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a prominent English painter of the 18th century. Reynolds' talent, industry, and common sense enabled him to achieve great work, and his time in Italy, where he studied and copied the works of masters, was invaluable to his development as an artist. He was influenced by various artists, including Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens, and was able to take the best from each and apply it to his own work. After returning to England, Reynolds quickly gained success as a portrait painter, thanks to the quality of his work and the patronage he received, and he went on to become the first President of the Royal Academy. His legacy as a great artist has endured, and his work continues to be celebrated for its mastery of technique and its ability to capture the essence of his subjects.
Scores:

    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some words may be less familiar to modern readers
    - [SYNTAX]:

        • Non-chronological ordering of events in Reynolds' life
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are wordy or contain multiple ideas

Section section_02 (Chars 8674–11592):
Section Summary: Many artists are only interesting to talk to when discussing their own work, but some, like Sir Joshua Reynolds, are accomplished men of the world with broader interests. Reynolds was fortunate to have friendships with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke, which likely inspired and influenced him. Despite his intellectual curiosity, Reynolds had his flaws, including snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which he partly overcame through his associations with refined people. However, these flaws sometimes led to lapses in taste, such as his ostentatious display of wealth. Overall, Reynolds' life and personality are more interesting and nuanced when considered in their entirety, rather than being idealized or sanitized.
