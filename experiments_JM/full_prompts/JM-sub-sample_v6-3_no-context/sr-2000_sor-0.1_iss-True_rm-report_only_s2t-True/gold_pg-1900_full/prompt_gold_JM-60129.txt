You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a legend that their forefathers came from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and they have retained their language and some of their customs. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique culture and language, which resembles Khirgis and Turkish, but they have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history or legends with the expedition team.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögurs, a Mongolian people, live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and use Chinese household utensils. Their clothing is a mix of Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men wearing long coats and fur hats, and women wearing distinctive head dresses adorned with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and tea made with salt and butter. They appear to be in straitened circumstances, with limited economic resources and a lack of energy and enthusiasm, particularly among the young men. Physically, they have prominent cheek bones, short and broad faces, and small eyes, with some individuals having distinctive nose shapes, such as turned-up or "potato" noses.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people are described as being of average height with black hair and thin beards, and are known for their slow movements except when it comes to buying and selling. Their customs include burning the dead on a bier, with the ashes gathered and covered with earth, and inheriting property through the wife. Marriage is a significant event, with the bride being bought and the wedding ceremony involving a lama reading prayers and the bride being received by the groom's family. The Sarö Yögur people also have unique practices surrounding childbirth and illness, with the lama playing a role in praying for the sick and the newborn. The author notes that the tribe's population has been decimated by unfavorable conditions, with deaths outnumbering births, although the accuracy of the statistical account is uncertain.

Section section_04 (Chars 24860–33012):
Section Summary: The author set out to visit the Shera Yögur Prince in the Nanshan mountains, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, who rode a small pony that kept pace with the author's larger horse. Along the way, they passed through a barren landscape with poor soil and coarse grass, and Kuá frequently stopped to warm himself by fires he made. The author eventually continued on to visit the "Yellow Tanguts" to the south, obtaining a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin and waiting for a military escort to arrive. After some delays, the author set out with a guide and followed a riverbed and ravine, passing through a challenging and rocky terrain, until they finally arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs. The monastery was a collection of buildings with a large, colorful temple at its center, surrounded by dozens of simple houses.

Section section_05 (Chars 33013–41250):
Section Summary: The author visited a monastery in K'anglungssu, where they observed the daily life and traditions of the Yögur lamas. The monastery's temple was a large and wealthy structure with Tibetan influences, featuring intricate carvings, Buddhist pictures, and hundreds of Buddha idols. The lamas, who numbered around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading to support themselves. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and taking in the scenic beauty of the surrounding landscape.

Section section_06 (Chars 41251–49022):
Section Summary: The author describes the appearance and demeanor of the lamas, who made a lasting impression with their distinctive clothing and warm smiles. The author then recounts their journey through the mountains, passing by various rivers and valleys, and eventually arriving at the residence of the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs. The t'umu's dwelling is a simple wooden house with minimal furnishings, and the author notes that the Shera Yögurs are a small tribe with only about 300 tents, governed by a system of hereditary leaders and traditional laws. The tribe has a complex history, with uncertain origins, but it is believed that they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects. The author also notes that the Shera Yögurs consider themselves to be Mongolian and claim a connection to the Sarö Yögurs, despite linguistic and cultural differences.

Section section_07 (Chars 49023–56548):
Section Summary: The Yögur tribe was originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors, and the current Yögur population is descended from six families sent to the area by the Chinese government. The tribe has dwindled in numbers due to death and intermarriage with the Chinese, with women outnumbering men and many families having few or no children. The Yögurs are divided into two groups, the Sarö and Shera Yögurs, each with their own administrative divisions and "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage rituals, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional ways of life. The tribe's social structure and customs are still maintained, despite their dwindling numbers and influence from external factors.
