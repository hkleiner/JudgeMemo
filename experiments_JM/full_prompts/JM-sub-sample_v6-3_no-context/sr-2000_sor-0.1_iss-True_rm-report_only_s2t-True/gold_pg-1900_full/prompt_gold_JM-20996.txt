You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8935):
Section Summary: The author participated in a historic movement, sending 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands on July 23, 1901. This event marked a milestone in civilization and an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's beauty and unique culture, including the famous sport of surf-shooting. Along the way, they crossed the International Date Line, resulting in the loss of a day, and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs. The author describes the challenging landing in Manila Bay and the group's initial impressions of the city and its people.

Section section_02 (Chars 8936–17730):
Section Summary: The author and other teachers spent two weeks in Manila before receiving a notice that they would need to supply themselves with basic necessities, such as a bed and cooking utensils, for six months. This caused concern among the teachers, who were unsure if they would be sent to remote areas with limited access to supplies. A meeting was held, and a committee was appointed to send a cablegram to the Associated Press, but it was ultimately decided to send it to the President instead. The teachers eventually departed for their assigned stations, with the author heading to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros, where he arrived after a two-day journey. Upon arrival, the author and his companions were transported to the town by an army wagon, where they encountered troops who were preparing to embark for home, marking the end of the reign of force and the beginning of the reign of peace.

Section Summary: As the American troops departed, the women's emotions overflowed, and they showed deep passion and love for their husbands. The scene was a dramatic and poignant display of human emotion. The American teachers, who were pioneers in the Philippines, faced challenges in establishing schools and implementing a new education system. They worked to make English the basis of instruction and overcame obstacles, such as a lack of schoolhouses and supplies, to establish successful schools. The teachers also participated in social events, including a "baile" in the town of Silay, where they interacted with the local elite and enjoyed Filipino hospitality.

After dinner, they danced, including a traditional Filipino dance called the "rigodon," and later waltzed with a señorita. The narrator was impressed by the wealth and fashion of the Filipinos, with many women wearing diamond brooches and rings, and men dressed in fine clothing. The narrator also discussed the challenges of housekeeping in the Philippines, where it is common to have many servants, and the difficulties of living in Manila, which is pleasant but expensive. Overall, the narrator observed that life in the Philippines is complex and dependent on international commerce, with many everyday items imported from around the world.

Section section_05 (Chars 34978–43720):
Section Summary: The Philippines has two extremes of life: one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan, while the other is inactive, decadent, and narrow. The wealthy Filipinos live in comfortable homes with polished floors, servants, and a variety of food, including rice, chicken, fish, and beef. In contrast, the poor Filipinos, known as "tao", live in humble conditions, eating a simple diet of rice and small fish, and often going without enough food. The middle class of Filipinos fills the gap between the rich and the poor, with a more moderate lifestyle. The author also visits a leper colony, embarking on the trip alone and armed with a revolver, after being given detailed directions on how to get there.

Section section_06 (Chars 43721–52199):
Section Summary: The narrator visited a leper settlement, initially receiving a hostile reception, but eventually gained access to the community with the help of guides and interpreters. The settlement was found to be a cluster of grass huts where people with leprosy lived, worked, and raised families, despite their debilitating condition. The narrator was struck by the contrast between the suffering and the normalcy of life in the settlement, where people experienced emotions like love, hatred, and joy. In a separate incident, the narrator joined a group of soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening a nearby town. The pursuit was ultimately unsuccessful, but it provided a glimpse into the primitive conditions and contrasts between traditional and modern life in the Philippines.

Section Summary: The narrator and others got on a cart pulled by a carabao, with the driver instructed to head back to their post without stopping. Due to concerns about potential danger from ladrones, they initially planned to stay awake, but eventually decided to sleep, trusting the driver to alert them if needed. Despite the rough ride, they slept soundly, only waking up when the sun was high in the sky, shining down on their faces. When they awoke, they were approaching a small village at the foot of the mountains. In the village, they procured ponies to take them back to their post.
