You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9137):
Section Summary: The author's interest in science was sparked by reading Tyndall's "Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination" and later introduced to Herbert Spencer's philosophy through an article on "Progress: its Law and Cause". Spencer's essay outlined the concept of evolution, where the simple becomes complex through successive differentiations, and applied this principle to various aspects of existence, from the development of the Earth to society and civilization. The author was drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, leading to a higher complication and progress. Spencer's work had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and his contributions are still recognized today. The author notes that while Spencer's focus on biological relationships was a strength, it also led to a narrowness of intent and a failure to consider other important relationships.
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Complex sentence structures may hinder readability
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic vocabulary and phrases (e.g., "animalcular", "superorganic") may be unfamiliar to modern readers
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long paragraphs and sentences can make the text difficult to follow
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transitions between ideas and historical references
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between personal anecdotes, philosophical discussions, and biographical information about Herbert Spencer
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some concepts, such as the "evolution of the simple into the complex", may be unclear to readers without prior knowledge of Spencer's philosophy

Section section_02 (Chars 9138–12774):
Section Summary: In his later years, Herbert Spencer was disheartened to see that his social and political doctrines were not widely accepted by a new generation of thinkers. Despite this, his contributions to the philosophy of life and mind remain significant. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the concept of evolution as a universal principle, governed by natural laws and processes. He believed that all phenomena, including mental evolution, could be explained in terms of matter, motion, and force. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy acknowledges the limitations of human understanding, recognizing that some mysteries, such as the ultimate reality, may be beyond human comprehension.
