You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8276):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a "carnet rouge" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber scenery.

Section Summary: The author visited the village of Barcy, which had been under fire for several days, and saw the damage caused by the war. The author then traveled to Châlons, where they observed French officers on a train, noting their height, calm demeanor, and strong nerves. Upon arrival in Châlons, the author was required to show their papers and obtain permission to stay in the town, and was eventually allowed to remain after their credentials were verified. The author was struck by the stillness and quiet of the town, but was able to find a hotel and explore the area. The French officials the author encountered were polite and courteous, but also vigilant and suspicious, reflecting the atmosphere of war and suspicion that pervaded the region.

Section Summary: The author arrived in Châlons, a town near the war front, and found it to be gray, silent, and shuttered with little evidence of life. They spent the day reading a novel, "Le Collier de la Reine!", in their hotel room, as they were unable to visit other towns due to restrictions. The next day, the author traveled to Bar-le-Duc, where they saw more signs of war, including ruins and burned fields, and struggled to find the Hotel du Commerce. Upon arriving at the hotel, they were met with a dirty and crowded environment, and a impertinent and indifferent reception from the staff. The author eventually had lunch in the hotel's dining room, which was filled with officers, and navigated the challenges of interacting with the locals in a war zone.

They then went to the military headquarters to request an automobile to visit the local hospitals, and were assisted by a polite and helpful staff. With the help of a chauffeur, the narrator visited two hospitals, Savonières and Hôpital Central, and was able to accomplish their objectives quickly. After completing their tasks, the narrator waited at the train station to return to Paris, where they witnessed a disturbing scene involving a drunken Algerian soldier, but remained calm due to the desensitizing effect of being in a war zone. The narrator eventually boarded their train and left Bar-le-Duc, relieved to be escaping the town's poor conditions and the proximity to the war.

Section Summary: The author, a woman, was initially restricted from visiting certain areas of the war zone due to concerns for her safety, but eventually obtained a military automobile and an American Army officer escort to accompany her. She traveled with Major C., Mme. Lyon, and their driver, Monsieur G. B., visiting hospitals and observing the war efforts in the zone. Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, causing delays and occasional confusion. Despite the author's desire for an adventurous experience, the trip was relatively calm and uneventful, with the group observing large numbers of soldiers, artillery, and camions, but no actual combat. The author noted the impressive condition of the roads and the sheer scale of the war efforts, with thousands of vehicles and soldiers visible throughout their journey.

Section section_06 (Chars 41481–49939):
Section Summary: The author observed many French soldiers who were not actively fighting, but rather resting or waiting to be called to the front. These soldiers were often seen in towns and villages, enjoying leisure activities such as fishing or practicing drills. In contrast, many women and children were working hard to harvest crops, and some villages were empty of men due to the war. The author also witnessed the effects of war on civilians, including newlywed couples on honeymoon in hotels near the front lines, and women and children living in ruins. The author reflects on the destruction caused by the war, citing the deliberate burning of towns by retreating German forces, and suggests that the ruins should be left intact as a testament to the horrors of war.

The author also learned about the German army's meticulous planning and knowledge of French territory, including the location of valuable artworks and properties owned by Germans, which were spared from destruction. The author's attempts to visit the town of Thann, which was under constant bombardment, were unsuccessful due to military restrictions.

The narrator and others later visit a house in Epernay, where they receive a propaganda leaflet dropped by a German plane, condemning French aviators for bombing civilian targets. The narrator then describes the founding of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé," a French-American society aimed at providing comfort to wounded soldiers, which was established by a group of prominent women, including several Americans. The society's goal is to provide care and support to convalescent officers and soldiers in the war zone.

Section section_09 (Chars 66756–75164):
Section Summary: In French military hospitals, the dietary kitchen typically only offers milk and eggs, which can be a problem for patients who have a strong dislike for these foods. The military discipline is strict, and there is no exception for individual tastes, but a supplementary kitchen with donated delicacies such as broth, sugar, and preserves can make a big difference in the recovery of wounded soldiers. Mme. d'Haussonville's organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, provides these essential items to hospitals in the war zone, which can be a challenge due to the scarcity of food and supplies in the area. The presence of these delicacies can boost the morale and aid in the recovery of the patients, and donations from the public are crucial in supporting this effort. By providing these simple yet essential items, donors can help make a significant impact on the lives of wounded soldiers.

Section section_10 (Chars 75165–82270):
Section Summary: The author visited the Hôpital Central in Bar-le-Duc, where they were shown around by the infirmière major, Mlle. de Sézilles, and the médicin chef. The hospital was well-organized and clean, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the wards, including decorations and flowering shrubs. The author was struck by the gratitude and cheerfulness of the wounded French soldiers, who appreciated the small comforts and kindnesses shown to them. The wealthy in France, however, are no longer able to support the war effort as they once did, due to financial struggles and depleted incomes. The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the war effort, highlighting the importance of practical sympathy and generosity.
