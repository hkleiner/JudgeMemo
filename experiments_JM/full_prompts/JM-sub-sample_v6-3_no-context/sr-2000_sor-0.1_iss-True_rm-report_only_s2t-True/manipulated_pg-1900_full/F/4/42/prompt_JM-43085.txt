You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8444):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature precisely. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier grew up in a time when French art was dominated by classic tradition, but he was influenced by the new spirit brought by Eugène Delacroix. Meissonier's early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, with his father initially discouraging him due to the tumultuous state of the art world at the time. Despite this, Meissonier's talent and dedication eventually prevailed, and he went on to become a successful artist. His commitment to realism and attention to detail characterized his work, as seen in his notable statement, "If I should sketch a horse from memory I should feel that I had been guilty of an insult to nature!"

Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and Léon Cogniet. He struggled financially, but found opportunities to decorate fans and create illustrations for publishers, which helped him make a living. At 16, Meissonier exhibited his work for the first time, but it was his illustrations for publications such as "The Indian Cabin" that brought him his first taste of success and recognition. His detailed and realistic drawings earned him praise and led to more opportunities, including illustrating works by notable authors like Lamartine. As his career took off, Meissonier was able to transition from seeking out work to having it come to him, marking the beginning of his path to glory.

Section section_04 (Chars 25482–32753):
Section Summary: In 1840, Meissonier submitted several paintings to the Salon, including "A Reader", "Saint Paul", and "Isaiah", but the latter two were dull and commonplace, suggesting he was trying to paint in a more traditional style.

Meissonier's subsequent paintings, such as "The Game of Chess" and "A Smoker", were highly acclaimed and earned him numerous awards and recognition. His success was due to his ability to capture the individuality and character of his subjects, as noted by art critic Théophile Gautier, who praised Meissonier's attention to detail and composition. Meissonier's paintings were able to convey a sense of life and reality, making him a standout artist of his time.

Section section_07 (Chars 49163–52658):
Section Summary: Meissonier was a painter who went to great lengths to ensure accuracy in his costumes and accessories, often going so far as to collect relics from the Imperial Epoch he worshipped. He had a vast "working library" of historical items, including clothing and jewelry, which he used to meticulously research and recreate scenes from French history.
