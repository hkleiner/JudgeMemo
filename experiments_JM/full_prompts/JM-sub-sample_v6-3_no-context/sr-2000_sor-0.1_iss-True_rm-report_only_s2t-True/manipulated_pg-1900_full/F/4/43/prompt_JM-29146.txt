You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is stranded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot's license. With no ship to pilot, Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the vital metal titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel.

Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Later, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi, where he encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Security Police. Symm insults Ramsey and orders him to leave, and when Ramsey refuses, Symm throws a drink in his face. The situation is tense, with many outworlders present, but Ramsey chooses not to react violently. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations of the Irwadian government, which is trying to reduce outworld influence.

When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, and she teases him about his situation with Mith, who mistakenly thinks the Earthgirl is Ramsey's wife.

After a night at Margot's apartment, she disappears, leaving Ramsey and the Vegan girl locked in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter from someone who claims to have discovered the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which may be connected to the origin of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter hints at a significant discovery, but its full meaning is not yet clear.

He believes that whoever discovers proto-man's secret will become incredibly powerful, and he wants Margot to continue his work. Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, to escape from the planet Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security. They work on repairing a old spaceship in a graveyard, planning to escape from the planet. Meanwhile, Margot, who has the ability to read minds, senses that they are being watched, and Ramsey finds himself drawn to her, trying to hide his thoughts from her telepathic abilities.

Meanwhile, Security Officer Ramar Chind reports to his boss, Garr Symm, who reveals that he wants to let Margot and Ramsey escape so they can follow them and uncover a valuable secret.

Section Summary: Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin prepare to depart from the Graveyard in the spaceship Enterprise, while Ramar Chind and his crew, along with Garr Symm, watch from the Dog Star. As the Enterprise enters hyper-space, Ramsey explains the concept of hyper-space and how it differs from normal space, where time and duration do not exist. Meanwhile, the Dog Star follows the Enterprise, using radar to track their movements, and Garr Symm notes that time stands still in hyper-space, making their pursuit effortless. The Enterprise encounters eddies in hyper-space, which Ramsey must navigate to stay on course, and Margot begins to understand the paradoxical nature of hyper-space. As they journey through hyper-space, the Enterprise is suddenly hit by an unseen force, causing it to lurch off course.

Margot decides to venture out onto the world, taking Vardin with her, and uses the threat of an m.g. gun to ensure Ramsey's compliance. However, Ramsey points out that the gun is useless in the timeless continuum of hyper-space, where time-based processes like radioactive breakdown cannot occur.
