You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16060):
Section Summary: Tony Croft, a curious and inquisitive boy, was often considered lazy by the villagers because he didn't conform to traditional learning methods. However, he was actually passionate about discovering the world around him, asking questions, and learning through hands-on experiences. He spent his time exploring nature, collecting specimens, and learning about music, even inventing his own instruments and repairing others. As he grew older, Tony's skills in music and instrument repair became more refined, earning him the trust of the villagers, who would bring him their broken instruments to fix. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother, although sometimes perplexed by his ways, loved and supported him.

Section section_03 (Chars 16060–24376):
Section Summary: The village where Anthony Croft lived disapproved of his love for the violin, with some people associating it with dancing and dissipation. Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins. At the age of 17, he made a significant discovery - a piece of 80-90 year old wood from a rare maple tree, which he carefully set aside to use for making a perfect violin in the future. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. With his mother's support, Anthony continued to pursue his dream of making perfect violins, inspired by the likes of Antonius Stradivarius.

Section Summary: Aunt Hitty had successfully organized Old Mrs. Butterfield's funeral, which was considered a great success by the villagers. After the funeral, Lyddy Ann, the niece, inherited the house and a small income, and she was pleased to have a quiet and solitary home. Lyddy's life had been marked by solitude and isolation due to a childhood accident that left her disfigured, and she had grown accustomed to keeping to herself. As she settled into her new home, the community was slow to get used to her presence, and Aunt Hitty was particularly disapproving of Lyddy's decision to remove the silver coffin-plates that her aunt had displayed. Lyddy, despite being nearly 40, was still young at heart and had a deep well of unexpressed emotions, which made her a complex and intriguing character.
