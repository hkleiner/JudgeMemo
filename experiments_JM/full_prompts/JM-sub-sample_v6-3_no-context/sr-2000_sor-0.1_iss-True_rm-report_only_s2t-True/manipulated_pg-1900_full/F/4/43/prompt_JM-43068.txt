You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_03 (Chars 17495–26466):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged and picturesque landscape shaping his perspective. Millet's family encouraged his early interest in drawing, and he spent his spare time reading and sketching the people and objects around him. As he grew older, Millet's passion for art only intensified, and he eventually made the decision to leave his rural home and migrate to Paris to pursue a career in art. This marked a significant turning point in his life, as he transitioned from a life of agricultural labor to one of artistic expression.

Section section_04 (Chars 26467–35277):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father took him to meet a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, who was impressed by the young artist's drawings. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, leading him to study with M. Langlois in Cherbourg. Langlois, who had a classical style, tried to mold Millet in his own method, but the young artist eventually struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a profound influence on his style. Millet eventually placed himself under the tutelage of Delaroche, but found the experience unsatisfying and soon ceased to attend his studio, instead working to develop his own unique style.

Section Summary: Jean-François Millet struggled to make a living as an artist, and he turned to portrait-painting to support himself, but he faced rejection and financial difficulties. He eventually moved to Barbizon, where he found inspiration in the peasant life and was able to focus on his true artistic passions.

Despite facing many challenges, including poverty and criticism, Millet continued to produce remarkable works, such as "The Winnower," and eventually gained recognition as an artist. His move to Barbizon marked a significant turning point in his career, allowing him to develop his unique style and artistic vision.
