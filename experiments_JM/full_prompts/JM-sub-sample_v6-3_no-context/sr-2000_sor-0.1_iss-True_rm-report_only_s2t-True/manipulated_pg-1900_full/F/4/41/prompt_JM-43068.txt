You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8762):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among his contemporaries for his profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday life. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, absorbing sincerity, and subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters. His paintings, such as "The Angelus", convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are not sentimental, but rather a truthful portrayal of the struggles and simple faith of peasant life. Millet's unique style and technique, shaped by his own life experiences and connection to the natural world, have secured his position as a great artist, even if he may not be considered a technical virtuoso.

Section section_02 (Chars 8763–17378):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet was a philosopher-artist who used his brush to convey profound thoughts and observations about life. His artwork often featured peasants and rural scenes, highlighting the simplicity and hardships of their daily lives. Millet's style was characterized by restraint and a focus on conveying a message rather than showcasing technical skill. He was particularly drawn to depicting the struggles and loneliness of peasant labor, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen" and "The Sower". Millet's art is best understood as a means to convey his philosophical observations, rather than solely as a demonstration of technical painting skill.

Section section_03 (Chars 17379–25874):
Section Summary: The French art world was dominated by classical traditions during the time of Louis XVI, and any innovative or naturalistic art was strictly monitored. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his later work as an artist. His family's simple and laborious life, surrounded by the rugged and picturesque landscape of Normandy, influenced his artistic style and themes. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a love for literature, which he developed through reading and drawing. He began to develop his artistic skills at a young age, drawing objects around him and eventually creating more complex works, such as a large drawing of two shepherds guarding their sheep.

Section section_04 (Chars 25875–34565):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's early life was marked by his exceptional observational skills and talent for drawing, which were encouraged by his family. He was apprenticed to a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, and later to M. Langlois, who tried to mold him in the classical tradition, but Millet eventually struck out on his own. With Langlois' support, Millet received a modest pension from the Municipal Council to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre. In Paris, Millet was drawn to the works of Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, and he developed a critically independent mind, but he struggled to find his place in the artistic establishment. He eventually became disillusioned with his teacher, Delaroche, and stopped attending his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties.

There, he developed his unique style, which often featured peasant life, and eventually gained recognition for his work. Millet's journey was marked by perseverance and dedication to his craft, which ultimately led to his success as a renowned artist.

Section section_06 (Chars 42953–51519):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet, a peasant painter, found inspiration in the daily life of villagers and peasants, which is reflected in his works.

Despite his talent, Millet struggled financially and faced criticism from art critics and some fellow artists, but he continued to paint, driven by his own genius and vision. His paintings, such as "The Angelus" and "Man with the Hoe", would later become highly valued and influential, with some selling for large sums of money. Millet's life was marked by financial difficulties, but he found some comfort in a commission to create four allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, which brought him a sense of joy and fulfillment.
