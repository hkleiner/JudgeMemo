You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8250):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a painter and her mother Sophie Marquis a musician. The family struggled financially, and Rosa's early life was marked by frequent moves and exposure to art and music. She developed a passion for drawing and painting at a young age and was eventually allowed to work in her father's studio, where she created her first painting, a still life of cherries. Her father's encouragement and her own determination set her on the path to becoming an artist. Rosa's unconventional upbringing, including being raised with her brothers and attending a boys' school, likely influenced her development as a strong-willed and talented artist.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, a determined and talented young artist, spent her early years studying and copying the works of great masters at the Louvre, earning her the nickname "the little hussard." She developed a passion for painting animals and spent countless hours studying their anatomy and behavior, eventually becoming a skilled sculptor as well. Rosa's hard work paid off when her paintings were accepted into the Salon in 1841, and she continued to exhibit her work annually, gaining recognition and praise from critics and the public. Her success grew progressively, and in 1848, she was awarded a first-class medal at the Salon, judged by her peers without academic prejudice. Rosa's personal life also underwent changes during this period, including her father's remarriage and the birth of a half-brother, which led her to move into her own studio and start a new chapter in her life.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a dedicated artist who continued to study and learn, even after achieving success. She was supported by her friend and collaborator, Nathalie Micas, who helped with her daily life and provided counsel. Bonheur's paintings, such as "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", brought her great recognition and financial success, with "The Horse Fair" being considered one of the greatest works of French painting. The painting had a complex history, being sold and resold several times, eventually ending up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. After her success, Bonheur moved to a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which was custom-built to meet her needs.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a renowned artist with a unique studio and menagerie, featuring a variety of animals that inspired her artwork. Her talent and reputation had spread beyond France, with critics and patrons praising her ability to capture rural life and the labor of the fields. She traveled to England and Scotland, where she was warmly received and found new inspiration for her paintings, including a series of works depicting the Highlands. Rosa Bonheur's success continued to grow, with her work being sought after by English and American collectors, and she was eventually awarded the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1865. She continued to work tirelessly, producing many notable paintings and solidifying her position as a leading artist of her time.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was honored by the Empress with an appointment to the Legion of Honour and was invited to breakfast at Fontainebleau, where she met the Emperor and the Prince Imperial. She later sent several works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a medal of the second class, likely due to the judges' resentment of her long absence from France and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, which she directed with devotion and intelligence, but eventually resigned in 1860 to focus on her own work. After retiring to her home in By, she devoted herself to her art, producing many notable works, but ceased to exhibit publicly until the year of her death in 1899. During the Franco-Prussian War, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotic spirit by aiding peasants and distributing donations to relieve their suffering.
