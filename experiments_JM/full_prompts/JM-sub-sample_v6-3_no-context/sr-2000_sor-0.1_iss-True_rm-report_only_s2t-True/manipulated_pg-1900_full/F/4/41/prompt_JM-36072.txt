You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9016):
Section Summary: The Victorian era was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which broke the continuity between the old order and the new. The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country, with a self-contained village system and a sparse population, governed by a cultivated and enlightened aristocracy. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and kindled a strong sense of nationalism in England, isolating it from European thought. The Victorian era, which spanned the latter half of the 19th century, was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order.

Section section_02 (Chars 9017–17648):
Section Summary: During the early 19th century, England experienced a significant output of great poetry, despite the country being at war. However, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and over-population being major issues. The government faced immense challenges, including famine and economic crises, which led to the implementation of flawed policies such as the system of doles. Critics like Disraeli, Carlyle, and Ruskin denounced the social and economic conditions of the time, with Ruskin arguing that the decay of art and beauty was closely linked to faulty social arrangements and the Industrial Revolution. The era was marked by a mix of complacency and social indignation, with many calling for reform and a return to simpler, more virtuous ways of living.

Section section_03 (Chars 17649–26470):
Section Summary: During Queen Victoria's reign, social reformers like Ruskin and Morris criticized the social and economic systems of the time, highlighting issues like industrialism and inequality. The administration of the Law was also flawed, with two separate systems of judicature, Law and Equity, leading to inefficiencies and injustices. The Universities, Civil Service, and Army were also in need of reform, with the Universities emerging from a period of decline, the Civil Service being a sanctuary of aristocratic jobbery, and the Army being underfunded and poorly managed. Despite these challenges, the period saw significant progress and improvements, with reforms in the Law, Universities, and Army, and the growth of optimism and good governance. By the end of the reign, England had made significant strides in various areas, including finance, education, and science, earning praise from historians like Lecky, who considered it a period of good governance.

Section section_04 (Chars 26471–35103):
Section Summary: The Victorian era was marked by significant events in politics, foreign policy, and literature. The dramatic duel between Gladstone and Disraeli dominated party politics, while foreign policy was marred by blunders such as the Opium War and the Crimean War. The era also saw the rise of nationalism, militarism, and protectionism, which ultimately led to the decline of international cooperation and the increase in competitive armaments. In literature, the Romantic movement gave way to a new generation of writers, including Alfred Tennyson, who became a prominent figure in Victorian literature. The Victorian era was a time of great prosperity and cultural achievement, but its advantages were temporary and would eventually give way to new challenges and uncertainties.

Section section_05 (Chars 35104–43487):
Section Summary: Tennyson's work is often depreciated by modern readers who prefer more realistic and scandalous content, but his poetry reflects his age and its values. Despite being seen as shallow, Tennyson's work, such as the Idylls of the King, is actually an allegory that explores deeper themes and convictions. He was aware of the social and political changes of his time, including the rise of materialism and revolution, and expressed his concerns and disillusionments in poems like the second Locksley Hall. Tennyson's religious views were also typical of his age, representing a Victorian attitude that was open to doubt and questioning of traditional dogma. Overall, Tennyson's work reflects the complexities and contradictions of his time, and his poetry remains a significant and thought-provoking part of English literature.

Section section_06 (Chars 43488–51864):
Section Summary: The Victorian era was a time of great change and contradiction, with the Church of England holding significant influence despite facing challenges from scientific leaders and secularism. The era also saw a flourishing of English literature, with notable authors such as Tennyson, Dickens, and Thackeray producing works that are still celebrated today. However, the age was also marked by vulgarity and materialism, with the Industrial Revolution bringing about significant social and economic changes. As the era drew to a close, societal disintegration and antagonistic movements began to emerge, threatening the stability of English civilization. Ultimately, the Victorian era is seen as a peak in English civilization, with the country's future prospects uncertain in the face of global changes and shifting power dynamics.
