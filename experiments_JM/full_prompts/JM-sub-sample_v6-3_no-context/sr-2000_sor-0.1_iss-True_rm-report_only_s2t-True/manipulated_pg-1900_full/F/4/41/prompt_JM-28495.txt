You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8064):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on their way to the Battersea Home for Lost Dogs to adopt a dog, having decided against buying a purebred dog with a pedigree. They take a tram to Battersea and, upon arrival, try to find the home without asking for directions, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful. A street boy they ask for help gives them a mischievous and unhelpful response, telling them to "bite a policeman." The couple then spots an official from the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs and decides to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in awkward situations, trying to avoid detection while pretending to be interested in various shop windows.

After their failed adventure, the narrator and Stella return home, where they later find a small, wet puppy tied to a brick by a string near a pond on the golf course. They decide to keep the puppy and, after some debate, name him Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grows up, he becomes a large, lumbering dog with a unique appearance and a humble but determined personality.

Section section_03 (Chars 16375–24621):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but dim-witted companion.

One notable incident involves Excalibur being given a shoulder of mutton, which he devours and then frantically tries to remember where he buried the bone. Excalibur's antics often lead to humorous and chaotic situations, including a dinner party where he is locked in the washhouse and later discovered to have hidden a bone behind a cushion in the drawing room.

Section section_04 (Chars 24622–32819):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on daily walks, introducing him to various people and experiences in the village. One day, while Eileen was out, Excalibur jumped into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, who was having breakfast, and made himself at home. Eileen soon arrived and was charmed by the curate, and the two struck up a conversation, with Excalibur serving as a chaperon. As they talked, Excalibur continued to cause mischief, eating food and knocking over objects, but the curate was smitten with Eileen and enjoyed her company. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself overworked as a chaperon, as Eileen and the curate spent more time together, including playing tennis on the lawn that Excalibur considered his own sanctuary.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a gentle creature, often found himself in awkward situations while accompanying his mistress Eileen and the curate on various outings, including tennis and golf games. During a golf game, Excalibur had a terrifying experience with a golf ball that retaliated with ferocity, causing him to panic. On a country walk, Excalibur encountered a hare and later found Eileen and the curate sitting together, holding hands, and deeply engrossed in a conversation about their future. The curate revealed that he had limited financial means and felt that they could not afford to get married, leading to a discussion about their uncertain future. Ultimately, the curate decided that he would have to leave for London to find work and build a better life for them, leaving Eileen and Excalibur behind.

After five years, Eileen's brother-in-law fell ill, and the family had to make arrangements, resulting in Eileen sending Excalibur to visit the curate in the north. Excalibur was taken to London by train, where he was reunited with the curate, and they caused a sensation in the city before the curate took Excalibur with him to the north. The curate and Excalibur eventually boarded a train, but not before Excalibur had to be chased down after he tried to follow Eileen's taxi.

The situation was resolved, and Eileen and the others were able to continue their afternoon in peace.
