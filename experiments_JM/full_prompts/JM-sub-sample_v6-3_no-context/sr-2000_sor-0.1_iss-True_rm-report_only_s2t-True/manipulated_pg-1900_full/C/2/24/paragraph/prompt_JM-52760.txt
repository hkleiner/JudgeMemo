3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8224):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy called for a two-pronged attack, with General Ulysses S. Grant leading the effort against Richmond and Petersburg, while General William T. Sherman marched towards Atlanta. Grant's army clashed with Confederate forces in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately failed to capture Richmond. The Union army then turned its attention to Petersburg, a vital transportation hub and supply center for the Confederacy, in an effort to isolate and capture the city, which would likely lead to the fall of Richmond.

Section section_02 (Chars 8225–16995):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, making it a vital supply point for the Confederate capital, Richmond. The city's defenses, known as the "Dimmock Line," were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates, led by General Beauregard, were initially outnumbered but received reinforcements from General Lee, and the battle continued for several days with intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces ultimately failed to break through the Confederate lines, and the battle became a prolonged siege of the city.

Section section_03 (Chars 16995–25551):
Section Summary: After failing to capture Petersburg, Union forces led by Grant began to consolidate their positions and prepare for a siege. They attempted to encircle the city by targeting the Weldon Railroad, but were repelled by Confederate forces, resulting in a loss of 2,300 men. Despite this, the Union army continued to extend their lines and cut off supply routes, with the ultimate goal of capturing Petersburg through a process of attrition. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including former coal miners, devised a plan to dig a mine shaft under the Confederate lines and blow it up, which became known as the Battle of the Crater. The Union army spent several weeks digging the mine, using improvised tools and a clever ventilation system to overcome the challenges of digging a long tunnel.

Section section_04 (Chars 25551–34076):
Section Summary: The Union army dug a tunnel under the Confederate lines, filling it with 8,000 pounds of black powder, which was detonated on July 30, killing or wounding at least 278 Confederate troops. The explosion created a large crater, but the Union charge that followed was delayed and disorganized, allowing the Confederates to rally and counterattack. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederates, led by Brig. Gen. William Mahone, were able to drive the Union troops back and eventually retake the crater. The Union army suffered heavy losses, with over 4,000 men killed, wounded, or captured, while the Confederates lost around 1,500 men. The battle was a decisive Confederate victory, with the Union army failing to achieve a breakthrough despite their initial advantage.

Section section_05 (Chars 34077–42653):
Section Summary: After the failed attempt to capture Petersburg, Grant shifted his focus to extending his siege lines and cutting off Lee's supply lines. The Union army successfully captured the Weldon Railroad on August 18, which was a significant blow to the Confederates, as it limited their ability to transport supplies. Despite some Confederate victories, including a surprise attack on Hancock's II Corps, the Union army continued to advance and encircle Petersburg, with the Battle of Peebles' Farm in late September pushing the Union lines further west. The Union army's relentless advance forced the Confederates to extend their defense lines, making them thinner and more vulnerable. By October, the Union army had made significant gains, but had not yet captured the Southside Railroad, a crucial supply line for the Confederates.

Section section_06 (Chars 42654–51132):
Section Summary: The Union's attempt to capture the Boydton Plank Road was thwarted by Confederate forces, leading to a Northern withdrawal. The winter months saw a lull in large-scale battles, with both sides focusing on strengthening their defenses and improving camp conditions. Despite being outnumbered and undernourished, Confederate forces continued to hold off the Union army, but their situation was dire, with dwindling troop numbers and a struggling food supply system. The Battle of Hatcher's Run in February 1865 was another Union attempt to encircle Petersburg, resulting in a slight extension of their lines but ultimately failing to break through. The Petersburg campaign was marked by boredom, hardship, and disease, with both sides suffering through the harsh winter conditions and awaiting the eventual outcome of the war.

Section section_07 (Chars 51133–59816):
Section Summary: By mid-March 1865, the Union army had a significant advantage over the Confederate forces, with Grant having at least 150,000 troops available, while Lee's forces had dwindled to around 55,000. Lee considered three options: negotiating peace terms, retreating to unite with Johnston, or attacking Grant's forces. He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union fort near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through the Union lines and facilitate a retreat. The attack, led by General Gordon, initially succeeded in capturing the fort, but the Confederates were ultimately forced back and suffered heavy casualties, with over 4,000 killed, wounded, or captured. The failed attack left retreat as the only viable option for the Confederates, and Grant was already planning to increase the pressure on the defenders of Petersburg.

Section section_08 (Chars 59817–68722):
Section Summary: General Grant planned to concentrate his efforts on the extreme right of the Confederate line, aiming to encircle the Army of Northern Virginia. The Union troops, led by Sheridan, moved out on March 29 and eventually clashed with Confederate forces at Dinwiddie Court House and Five Forks, ultimately winning the Battle of Five Forks on April 1. This victory allowed the Union to cut off Lee's supply lines and put them in position to break through his fortifications. The fall of Five Forks led to the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, with Lee advising President Davis to prepare to leave the capital on the night of April 2. The Union army then launched a successful assault on Petersburg, breaking through the Confederate lines and surrounding the city, ultimately leading to the flight of the Confederate government.

Section section_09 (Chars 68723–72473):
Section Summary: The capture of Fort Gregg and the breaking of the Confederate line led to the realization that Petersburg and Richmond could no longer be held, and General Lee ordered a retreat. The Confederate army withdrew from Petersburg and Richmond on the evening of April 2, and Union troops took possession of the cities on April 3. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked a significant turning point in the war, as it led to the eventual surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9. The Petersburg campaign had come at a heavy cost, with over 42,000 Union casualties and more than 28,000 Confederate losses. The war ultimately ended with the surrender of all Confederate forces by early June 1865.
