You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8390):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their language and culture showed similarities to Khirgis and Turkish, but they had no written language or recorded history.

The author eventually arrived in Kanchow, where they obtained a letter of introduction to the Tangutan Prince and prepared for their visit to the Shera Yögurs. After a delay, they set out with a guide and traversed a challenging ravine, crossing icy rivers and navigating steep and rocky terrain. They finally arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, which was situated on the lower slopes of small hills and featured a large, colorful temple.

Section Summary: The monastery of K'anglungssu is the chief religious shrine of the Shera Yögurs, with a large and wealthy temple that shows signs of Tibetan influence. The temple is decorated with Buddhist pictures, banners, and hundreds of small compartments containing images of Buddha, with a bronze statue of Tsunkoa as the central figure. The lamas living in the monastery are few, around 15, and are supported by voluntary contributions for their services as prayer-readers. The lamas are simple and poor, with limited knowledge of the Tangutan language and no involvement in medicine, instead relying on fortune-tellers to predict the future and pray for the sick. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and the t'umu, and departed for a return visit, taking in the pleasant scenery of the surrounding mountains and valleys.

The tribe has a complex history, with uncertain origins, but it is believed that they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects. The author also notes that the Shera Yögurs consider themselves to be Mongolian and claim a connection to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language.

Section section_07 (Chars 49351–56910):
Section Summary: The Yögur tribe was originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors, and the current Yögur population is descended from six families sent to the area by the Chinese government. The tribe has dwindled in numbers due to death and intermarriage with the Chinese, and they are now divided into two groups: the Sarö and Shera Yögurs. The Shera Yögurs are further divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage rituals, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional practices. The tribe is led by a nominal head, Ta t'umu, but his authority is limited, and the settlement of taxes and other matters is handled by others.
