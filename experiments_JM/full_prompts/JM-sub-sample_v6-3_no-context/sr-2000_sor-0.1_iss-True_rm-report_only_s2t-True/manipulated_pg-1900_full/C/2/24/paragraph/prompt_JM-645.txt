You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7852):
Section Summary: The narrator, a young writer, is given the task of reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel by his friend George Corvick, who is unable to do it himself due to a personal emergency. The narrator is eager to meet Vereker, a renowned author, and sees this as an opportunity to make a good impression. After writing the review, the narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unsure if he has read the review and is hesitant to bring it up. Vereker's pleasant and affable nature makes the narrator want him to read the review, which he believes does justice to his work. Ultimately, it is Lady Jane who brings attention to the review, praising it and potentially doing for the narrator what he couldn't do for himself.

Section section_02 (Chars 7852–15627):
Section Summary: The narrator's review of Hugh Vereker's book was praised by Lady Jane, but when Vereker himself commented on it, he called it "the usual twaddle", which hurt the narrator's feelings. However, later that evening, Vereker approached the narrator and apologized for his earlier comment, explaining that he had been misunderstood. Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the true point of his work. He confided in the narrator, sharing his feelings of being a failure despite his success, and the two connected over their shared love of literature. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kindness and sincerity, and his initial hurt was replaced by a deeper understanding and appreciation of the author.

Section section_03 (Chars 15627–23262):
Section Summary: The narrator is discussing literature with Vereker, who hints at a hidden meaning or "little point" in his writing that he considers the most important aspect of his work. Vereker describes this element as the "particular thing" that drives him to write and is the core of his artistic passion, but he refuses to explicitly state what it is. He suggests that critics should be able to discover this hidden meaning, but acknowledges that it may be difficult to find. The narrator presses Vereker for a clue, but he only offers vague hints, saying that the answer is embedded in every line and word of his writing. Vereker ultimately ends the conversation, leaving the narrator determined to uncover the secret meaning in his work.

Section section_04 (Chars 23262–31149):
Section Summary: The narrator tried to uncover the "general intention" in Vereker's writing, but ultimately failed and became disenchanted with his books. He shared his experience with George Corvick, who became intrigued and determined to uncover the secret. Corvick believed that there was something more to Vereker's writing, something that wasn't immediately apparent, and he was eager to explore it further. Vereker, however, wrote to the narrator, asking him not to share their conversation, as he didn't want to give away the secret, and the narrator felt guilty for already having shared it with Corvick. The narrator visited Vereker to apologize and warn him that the secret might spread, but Vereker seemed unconcerned, suggesting that even if it did, it wouldn't necessarily lead to anyone uncovering the truth.

Section Summary: The narrator visits Vereker, who advises him to give up his search for the hidden meaning in his works, but the narrator senses that Vereker is being evasive and indifferent. The narrator then discusses his conversation with George Corvick, who is determined to uncover the secret with his partner Gwendolen. Corvick and Gwendolen are enthusiastic and meticulous in their approach, re-reading Vereker's works and analyzing them carefully. The narrator is skeptical of their efforts, but Corvick is undeterred, convinced that he will eventually uncover the truth. As the narrator observes Corvick and Gwendolen's collaboration, he begins to feel a sense of unease and expectation, wondering if they will ultimately succeed where he failed.

Section section_06 (Chars 39142–47046):
Section Summary: The narrator had lost touch with George Corvick, who had left England for India to work as a special commissioner for a provincial paper. Corvick had previously been searching for the hidden meaning in Vereker's novels, but had seemingly given up, and the narrator had also lost interest. However, Corvick sent a telegram from Bombay saying "Eureka. Immense", indicating that he had discovered Vereker's secret. Gwendolen Erme, Corvick's acquaintance, shared the news with the narrator, who was excited but also disappointed that Corvick didn't reveal what he had discovered. The narrator and Gwendolen Erme are eager to learn more about Corvick's discovery, which they believe will be revealed in a forthcoming letter.

Section section_07 (Chars 47046–54794):
Section Summary: Gwendolen and the narrator are eagerly waiting to hear from Corvick, who has discovered the "figure in the carpet," a secret about Vereker's writing. Corvick sends a telegram saying he wants to see their reactions when he reveals the secret, and later, Gwendolen receives a letter from him stating that he will tell her the secret after they are married. Gwendolen claims to be engaged to Corvick, which surprises the narrator, as Corvick had previously told him that they were not engaged. The narrator is skeptical of Gwendolen's claim, wondering if she has fabricated an engagement to get what she wants. Corvick's letters and telegrams continue to tantalize and frustrate the narrator and Gwendolen, who are desperate to learn the secret of the "figure in the carpet."

Section section_08 (Chars 54794–62825):
Section Summary: The narrator was unable to meet with George Corvick in England due to his brother's illness, which required him to travel to Germany and later to Meran. During this time, Corvick wrote to the narrator, asking him to wait until his article on Vereker's writings was complete before inquiring about it. However, before the article was finished, Corvick's plans were interrupted by the death of Mrs. Erme, which led to his quick marriage to Gwendolen. Tragically, Corvick died in an accident on his honeymoon, leaving behind only a fragment of his article, which did not reveal the secret of Vereker's work. The narrator is left wondering if Gwendolen had gained knowledge of the secret before Corvick's death, and if their marriage was motivated by a desire to uncover it.

Section Summary: The narrator continues to try to extract Vereker's secret from Mrs. Corvick, but she remains tight-lipped, even after her husband's death. Despite her reserve, the narrator remains sympathetic towards her and visits her often, discussing Corvick and Vereker's work. Mrs. Corvick eventually makes it clear that she will never reveal the secret, telling the narrator that it is her "life" and that he has insulted the dead by asking. The narrator later reviews her novel, "Overmastered", but finds no hint of Vereker's secret, and is surprised to learn that Drayton Deane, a friend of Corvick's, has also reviewed the book. Drayton Deane becomes a regular presence in Mrs. Corvick's life, and the narrator is dismayed to learn that he will be reviewing Vereker's latest book, "The Right of Way".

Section section_11 (Chars 78822–83827):
Section Summary: The narrator is seeking information about Hugh Vereker's secret, a general intention behind his books, which he believes was shared with George Corvick and then with Corvick's wife, Mrs. Deane. However, when the narrator approaches Mrs. Deane's husband, he discovers that the husband was not privy to this information, despite being married to her. The husband is genuinely unaware of Vereker's secret, which surprises the narrator and leads him to realize that Mrs. Deane did not think her husband worthy of sharing the information with. The narrator shares his own story of searching for Vereker's secret with the husband, who becomes increasingly interested and curious. The husband's newfound desire for knowledge creates a sense of solidarity between him and the narrator, who are now both driven by an unappeased desire to uncover Vereker's secret.
