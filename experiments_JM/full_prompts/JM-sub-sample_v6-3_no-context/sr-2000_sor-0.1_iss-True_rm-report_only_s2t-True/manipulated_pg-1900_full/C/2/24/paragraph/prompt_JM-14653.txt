You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8421):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder and enthusiasm of Christmas, but adults have lost some of that faith and excitement, and now often view the holiday as a time of indulgence and obligation. The author argues that this decline in the significance of Christmas is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied.

Section section_02 (Chars 8421–17251):
Section Summary: The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. This has led to a decline in faith and a focus on facts, causing people to question the validity of Christmas and its traditions. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, such as faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are essential for humanity's existence and happiness. The celebration of Christmas on December 25th, coinciding with the winter solstice, is a symbolic moment that represents the triumph of light over darkness and the birth of hope. Ultimately, the author suggests that despite the changes brought about by science and skepticism, the true spirit of Christmas remains a vital and enduring part of human experience.

Section section_03 (Chars 17252–25970):
Section Summary: The concept of social justice is flourishing, with many people enthusiastically working towards it, driven by a desire for goodwill and the recognition of the brotherhood of mankind. Despite the decline of other faiths, the idea of universal goodwill is alive and vibrant, inspiring many literary artists and social reformers. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster faith in goodwill, providing a concrete symbol of an intangible idea. Christmas, with its traditions and spirit of peace and goodwill, is particularly well-suited to promote this faith, and its customs, such as gift-giving and sending cards, can be powerful expressions of sympathy and kindness. By embracing these traditions, people can reconnect with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood that underlies the holiday.

Section section_04 (Chars 25971–34725):
Section Summary: The author defends the tradition of feasting during Christmas, arguing that it brings joy and expansion, and that excess is a natural part of celebration. However, the author also emphasizes the importance of moderation and dignity, warning against taking excess to extremes. The author suggests that the spiritual benefits of feasting, including the acceptance of ridiculousness and the expansion of one's common sense, are essential to the human experience. To revitalize the Christmas festival, which has lost some of its old vitality, the author proposes focusing on the cultivation of goodwill, a element that unites people across different sects and beliefs. By concentrating on goodwill, the festival can acquire a fresh and genuine significance without overthrown traditions or shocking those who hold onto older meanings.

Section section_05 (Chars 34725–43307):
Section Summary: The author believes that cultivating goodwill is a personal task that cannot be achieved through societies or organizations. Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill in their own heart by thinking thoughts of kindness and compassion towards others. The author suggests starting with a small group of people, such as those in your daily life, and specializing in one person who often annoys you. To cultivate goodwill towards this person, one must use their imagination to understand and sympathize with their feelings, difficulties, and struggles. By doing so, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the other person, and ultimately increase their goodwill towards them.

Section section_06 (Chars 43308–52268):
Section Summary: The practice of imagining and understanding others' perspectives can lead to goodwill towards them and a decrease in egotism and resentment. By regularly exercising this imaginative understanding, one can develop a more sympathetic and compassionate attitude towards others, leading to stronger and more meaningful relationships. This discipline can also increase one's interest in others, making interactions more enjoyable and meaningful. Ultimately, the systematic cultivation of goodwill can lead to an increase in one's own happiness, as it diminishes resentment and annoyance and fosters a more benevolent attitude towards others. By adopting this approach, even special occasions like Christmas can take on a new significance, becoming a celebration of friendship and mutual understanding.

Section section_07 (Chars 52269–60927):
Section Summary: The idea that all motives are selfish is presented, with the notion that even acts of kindness are driven by a desire to alleviate one's own dissatisfaction. The period between Christmas and New Year's is described as a time of reflection and reaction, where people often feel discouraged and dissatisfied with their lives. Despite this, individuals will continue to strive for their goals and ideals, even if they seem unattainable, as it is human nature to do so. The concept of New Year's resolutions is explored, with the understanding that people will inevitably fall short of their ideals, but will continue to make new attempts, driven by their innate optimism and self-conceit. Ultimately, this cycle of striving and falling short is seen as a fundamental aspect of the human experience.

Section section_08 (Chars 60928–66326):
Section Summary: The concept of evil is not a positive principle, but rather a lack of perfection. If the world were perfect, there would be no motivation for effort or change, and life would essentially be dead. True happiness is not found in the absence of challenges or the attainment of luxury, but rather in an inward state of mind that accepts discontent as a part of life and strives for self-improvement. Real happiness is found in the present moment, in the struggle to achieve one's ideals, and in the connections and experiences that make life worth living. Ultimately, despite its drawbacks and disappointments, most people find that life is worth living due to the "golden moments" and meaningful relationships that make it rich and fulfilling.
