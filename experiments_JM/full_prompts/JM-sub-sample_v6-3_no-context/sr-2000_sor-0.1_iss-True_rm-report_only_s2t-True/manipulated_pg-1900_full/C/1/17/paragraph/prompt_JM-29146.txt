You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8081):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially and has a family to support. Englander is worried about his future and that of his family, but Ramsey tries to reassure him by claiming he has some savings to fall back on. The situation is dire, with the Irwadian government seeking to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal, and only allowing Irwadian pilots to operate.

Section section_02 (Chars 8082–16018):
Section Summary: Ramsey lends 375 credits to his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and tells him to pay him back whenever he can. Later, Ramsey visits a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi, where he encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Security Police. Symm, who is hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen, insults Ramsey and tells him to leave, eventually sloshing a drink in his face. Ramsey, aware that he is in a precarious situation, chooses not to react aggressively, despite being insulted. The encounter highlights the tensions between Earthmen and Irwadians, with the latter resenting the former's economic and military power in the galaxy.

Section Summary: Captain Ramsey meets a beautiful Earthgirl named Margot Dennison, a former tri-di star, who offers him a job to pilot her ship through hyper-space to Centauri in exchange for 1,000 credits. Ramsey agrees, on the condition that a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After spending the night in Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has disappeared, leaving them locked in. Ramsey searches the apartment, finding it furnished in a feminine style, but discovers no evidence of Margot's acting career on Irwadi. He does, however, find a mysterious letter in one of the compartments, which piques his interest.

Section section_05 (Chars 31945–40358):
Section Summary: Ramsey found a letter in Margot Dennison's apartment that seemed important to her, and as he read it, he discovered that it was from her father, who was dying of cancer. The letter spoke of a "proto-man" and a hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which could hold the key to immense power and influence in the galaxy. Margot's father had been searching for this secret and wanted Margot to continue his work, but warned her that presenting the information to scientists would be met with laughter and disbelief. Ramsey was perplexed by the letter and its references to proto-man and hyper-space, and he was soon joined by Margot, who had returned to the apartment. The two of them were on the run, with a wanted bulletin issued for their arrest, and they began working on a ship in a nearby Spacer Graveyard, planning to escape from the planet.

Section section_06 (Chars 40359–48329):
Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are working on a 50-year-old Canopusian freighter in the Spacer Graveyard, trying to repair it to escape. Margot, who can read minds, senses that they are being watched, and Ramsey is anxious, trying to hide his thoughts and feelings from her. Meanwhile, Security Officer Ramar Chind reports to his boss, Garr Symm, who wants to let the trio escape so they can be followed, as they may lead them to something of immense importance found in Margot's apartment. Symm orders Chind to plant a fuel supply in one of the wrecks to aid their escape. The true purpose of their mission is not clear, but it seems to be connected to a letter that could give Irwadi a dominant position in the galaxy.
