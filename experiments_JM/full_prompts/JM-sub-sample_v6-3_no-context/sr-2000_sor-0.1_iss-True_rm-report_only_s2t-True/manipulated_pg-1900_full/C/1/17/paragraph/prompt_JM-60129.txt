You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8494):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a barren landscape and eventually arrived at the village of Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people, also known as the "yellow Yögurs". The villagers claimed to have originated from a city in the west over a thousand years ago and had a distinct language and culture. The team visited the village temple, which was small and poorly maintained, and met with the lamas who lived there and earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood. The Sarö Yögur people had a unique culture and language, but their history and traditions were not well-documented, and the team was unable to gather much information about their past.

The temple, a large and wealthy religious shrine, featured a bronze statue of Tsunkoa and other Buddhist deities, as well as colorful banners and intricate carvings. The lamas, who numbered around 15, were friendly and obliging, but initially fearful of the author's anthropological instruments. The author eventually left the monastery, accompanied by the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo, and departed with a more positive impression of the surrounding countryside. The monastery and its surroundings were characterized by a mix of natural beauty, with grassy hills, fir trees, and a winding valley, and traditional Tibetan-influenced architecture.

The t'umu complained about the arbitrariness and extortion of the Chinese officials, who levy horses and taxes from the tribe. The origins of the Shera Yögurs are unclear, but they believe they migrated to the area during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and are related to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language.

Section section_07 (Chars 49622–57637):
Section Summary: The Yögur tribe was originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors, and later replaced by six tshi Huang-fan from Urumtchi. The Shera and Sarö Yögurs are the remnants of these six tshi and are considered irregular troops by the Chinese military authorities. The tribe has diminished in size due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element, with women outnumbering men and many families having few children. The Yögurs have a unique culture, with customs such as leaving the dead to be eaten by birds of prey and arranging marriages between families, where the bride is bought and the agreement is made by the parents. The tribe is divided into administrative divisions, with the Shera Yögurs having several "bones" and the Sarö Yögurs having their own divisions, with Ta t'umu considered the head of both tribes.
