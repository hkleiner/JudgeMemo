You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8543):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a drawing master and her mother Sophie Marquis a music teacher. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After trying various occupations, including dressmaking and school, Rosa's father allowed her to focus on art, and she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which showed promise of her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to art, beginning her apprenticeship by copying the works of great masters at the Louvre.

Section section_02 (Chars 8544–16957):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, nicknamed "the little hussard," spent most of her time studying and sketching at the Louvre and her father's studio, where she developed her skills and understanding of art. She became particularly passionate about painting animals and spent hours observing and studying them, even keeping a menagerie in her home. Her hard work paid off when her paintings were accepted into the Salon in 1841, and she continued to exhibit her work annually, gaining recognition and praise from critics. Despite initial hostility from the jury, Rosa's sincerity and talent eventually earned her a first-class medal in 1848, judged by her peers without academic prejudice. As her career took off, Rosa moved into her own studio, accompanied by her devoted friend and fellow artist, Mlle. Micas, who often collaborated with her on her canvases.

Section section_03 (Chars 16958–25257):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's success continued to grow, with her paintings selling profitably and gaining recognition. Her artwork, such as "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", showcased her exceptional talent and attention to detail, earning her a reputation as a leading artist. To prepare for "The Horse Fair", Rosa disguised herself in masculine clothing to observe horse fairs without drawing attention to herself. The painting was eventually sold to a London picture dealer, Mr. Gambard, and later changed hands several times, ultimately being sold at a high price to Mr. Vanderbilt. Rosa's dedication to her craft and her integrity as an artist were evident in her meticulous work and generous offers, such as her attempt to replace a reduced replica of "The Horse Fair" in the National Gallery with a newly painted version.

Section section_04 (Chars 25258–33497):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's menagerie, which included a variety of animals, was a key part of her artistic inspiration and was housed at her studios in Paris and Chevilly. Her reputation as an artist had spread internationally, and she was celebrated for her paintings of rural life, with critics praising her as the "inspired interpreter of rural life". In 1854, she visited England, where she was warmly received and found inspiration for new paintings, including scenes of cattle and rural landscapes. Rosa Bonheur's success continued to grow, and in 1865, she was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the Empress, a testament to her artistic achievements. She continued to work prolifically, producing many notable paintings, and her studio at By, with its vast menagerie, became a hub of creative activity.

Section section_05 (Chars 33498–41918):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was honored to meet the Emperor and Empress, and she was invited to join them for breakfast and an excursion on the lake. She later sent ten of her works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a second-class medal and was met with coldness from the judges and critics. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, where she was a demanding but kind teacher, and many of her students went on to have successful careers in painting. After resigning from the school, she retired to her home in By, where she devoted herself to her art and worked tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers. During the war of 1870, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity by aiding the suffering peasants and refusing to accept favors from the Prussian invaders.

Section Summary: After the treaty of peace was signed, Rosa Bonheur resumed her work, focusing on studying and painting big cats, which led to an admirable series of wild beasts that showcased her power of expression and execution. Her paintings of lions and panthers were particularly notable, capturing their movements and expressions with great truth and force. Rosa Bonheur's life took a turn when her dear friend, Mlle. Micas, passed away, leaving her heartbroken and melancholic, but she continued to work with energy and dedication. She received the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour from President Carnot, a well-deserved recognition of her life's work, and later formed a close friendship with a young American artist, Miss Anna Klumpke. Rosa Bonheur continued to paint until the end of her career, producing notable works such as "The Duel" and "The Threshing of the Grain", which demonstrated her enduring talent and skill.
