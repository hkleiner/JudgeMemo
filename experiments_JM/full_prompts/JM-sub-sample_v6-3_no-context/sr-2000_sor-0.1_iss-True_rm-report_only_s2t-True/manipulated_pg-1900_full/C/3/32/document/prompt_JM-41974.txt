You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8282):
Section Summary: Veronese, considered one of the greatest painters, was known for his absurd yet adorable style, which disregarded logic and historical truth in favor of vibrant colors and fantasy. Born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, he came from a family of artists and was trained by his uncle Antonio Badile and another Veronese painter, Giovanni Carotto. Veronese's early work showed promise, and he quickly gained recognition, including a commission from Cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga to paint a picture for the cathedral at Mantua. He surpassed his competitors and gained preference, but soon found that his native city was too limited for his ambitions, leading him to leave Verona with his friend Battista Zelotti to seek new opportunities. Veronese's unique style, which glorified Venice and its opulence, would become his distinctive mark and earn him a lasting reputation as a great painter.

Veronese was particularly drawn to the vibrant and luxurious aspects of life, which he reflected in his paintings, often depicting grand scenes with elaborate settings and accessories. Despite being influenced by other artists, Veronese managed to maintain his unique style and perspective, creating works that were characterized by their joy and exuberance. In Venice, Veronese formed valuable friendships, including with the Prior of the convent of San Sebastiano, Bernardo Torlioni, who helped him secure important commissions, including the decoration of the church of San Sebastiano. Veronese's success in Venice was rapid, with his work receiving widespread acclaim and establishing him as a prominent artist.

Section section_03 (Chars 16895–25339):
Section Summary: During the height of Venice's glory, Paolo Veronese arrived at the perfect moment to satisfy the city's demand for art, surpassing his rivals and becoming one of the most renowned painters of his time. He was commissioned to decorate various buildings, including the palace of Patriarch Daniele Barbaro and the Doge's Palace, where he worked alongside Tintoretto. Veronese's fame continued to grow, and he was declared the winner of a competition to decorate the library, with his paintings being praised by Titian himself. One of his most famous works, "The Wedding at Cana," was painted for the convent of San Giorgio Maggiore and is now considered one of the gems of the Louvre museum. Veronese's artistic genius and productivity were unmatched, and he never employed collaborators, except for his brother Benedetto Caliari, who assisted with architectural designs.

Section section_04 (Chars 25339–33833):
Section Summary: Veronese's painting, "The Wedding at Cana", is a masterpiece that showcases his unique method, which disregards historical accuracy and traditional religious depictions. The painting features a mix of biblical figures and contemporary personalities, including the artist himself, Titian, and Tintoretto. Veronese's work was widely admired, but it also drew criticism from traditionalists who saw his introduction of fantastical elements as irreverent. He was summoned before the Inquisition in 1573 to defend his work, and was ultimately forced to modify one of his paintings to conform to the Church's standards. Despite this, Veronese's reputation as a great artist endured, and he continued to produce notable works, although his journey to Rome, which he had long desired, was brief and not well-documented.

His personal life is not well-documented, but it is known that he married, had two sons, and was a man of strict principles and settled habits. Veronese was a prolific artist, and his works can be found throughout the Ducal Palace, including the great central oval of the ceiling and the lateral panels, which feature scenes of Venetian history and mythology. One of his notable works from this period is "The Family of Darius at the Feet of Alexander," a large and intricate painting that showcases his skill and creativity.
