You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8881):
Section Summary: The author participated in a historic movement to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands, which marked an epoch in world history. On July 23, 1901, the US Army Transport "Thomas" set sail from San Francisco, carrying 499 trained men and women to the Philippines. The ship stopped at Honolulu, where the passengers visited notable sites such as the Pali and the Bishop Museum, and later crossed the International Date Line, losing a day in the process. The ship eventually arrived in Manila Bay, known for its rough waters, and the passengers disembarked onto steam launches to reach the shore. Upon landing, they were introduced to the local culture and customs of the Filipino people, including their traditional clothing and habits.

The teachers eventually agreed to proceed to their stations after being assured that their needs would be met. The author traveled to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros, where they arrived by ship and were transported to the town by steam launch and army wagon. As they arrived, they witnessed the departure of American troops and the beginning of a new era of peace, with the author and other teachers taking on a new role in the region.

They made progress, with separate schools for boys and girls, and by the end of a year, two schools were thriving. The teachers also participated in social events, including a "baile" hosted by the town of Silay, where they interacted with the local elite and enjoyed Filipino cuisine.

Section section_05 (Chars 34890–43627):
Section Summary: The Philippines has two extremes of life: one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan, while the other is inactive, decadent, and narrow. The former is characterized by a pleasant life with access to various amenities, while the latter is marked by a simple, traditional way of life in quiet hamlets. In these hamlets, life is slow-paced and unchanged for generations, with limited exposure to the outside world. The Filipino home life also varies greatly between the rich and the poor, with the wealthy enjoying comfortable homes and abundant food, while the poor, known as the "tao", live in simpler conditions with limited access to food and amenities. Overall, the Philippines presents a stark contrast between modernity and tradition, with a wide gap between the rich and the poor.

Section Summary: The narrator visited a leper settlement, initially receiving a hostile reception, but eventually gained access to the community with the help of guides and interpreters. The settlement was found to be a cluster of grass huts where people with leprosy lived, worked, and raised families, despite their debilitating condition. The narrator was struck by the contrast between the suffering and the normalcy of life in the settlement, where people experienced emotions like love, hatred, and joy. In a separate incident, the narrator joined a group of soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening a nearby town. The pursuit was ultimately unsuccessful, but it provided a glimpse into the primitive conditions and contrasts between traditional and modern life in the Philippines.

Section Summary: The narrator and others got on a cart pulled by a carabao, with the driver instructed to head back to their post without stopping. Due to concerns about potential danger from ladrones, they initially planned to stay awake, but eventually decided to sleep, trusting the driver to alert them if needed. Despite the rough ride, they slept soundly, only waking up when the sun was high in the sky, shining down on their faces. When they awoke, they were approaching a small village at the foot of the mountains. In the village, they procured ponies to take them back to their post.
