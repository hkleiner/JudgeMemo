You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8705):
Section Summary: The section begins with a tribute to Mr. Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar who dedicated his life to promoting Hebraic thought and learning. Davis's work helped to revitalize the Hebrew language, which had been preserved as a ritual language but was not commonly spoken. The concept of a "Chosen People" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. The idea of special election is not unique to Judaism, as other groups, such as the Germans, have also developed similar doctrines. The section highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding the concept of a "Chosen People" and its implications for interfaith relations and national identity.

Section section_02 (Chars 8706–16926):
Section Summary: The Bible contains passages that seem to promote violence and superiority, such as the slaughter of surrendered Moabites and the promise of wealth and power to the Jewish people. However, these passages must be considered in their historical context and interpreted in a way that takes into account the cultural and social norms of the time. The Jewish tradition has evolved over time, and many of these violent and exclusivist ideas have been mitigated or rejected by later Jewish thinkers and scholars. Despite this, the Jewish community has continued to reverence its past and preserve its traditions, even as it has adapted and evolved to new circumstances. Ultimately, the complexity and diversity of Jewish thought and tradition cannot be reduced to simplistic or stereotypical interpretations.

Section section_03 (Chars 16926–25624):
Section Summary: The Old Testament reaches the highest ethical note in literature, emphasizing a universal salvation and a mission to serve humanity. The concept of a "chosen people" is often misunderstood, but it actually refers to a people chosen to serve as a light to the nations, not for their own superiority. The Old Testament is filled with metaphors and lyrics that express a noble and idealistic vision, such as the "suffering servant" and the "kingdom of priests." This idealism is not limited to the Jewish people, but is a universal message that has inspired civilization. The true essence of Judaism lies in its apostolic altruism, a selfless mission to serve the world, rather than in any claim of superiority or tribalism.

Section section_04 (Chars 25625–33963):
Section Summary: The concept of a "tribal God" in Judaism is misleading, as the God of the Bible is depicted as a universal ruler who demands righteousness and loves all people. From the earliest literature, such as Genesis, God is shown to be a righteous and just deity who cares for all humanity, not just the Israelites. The biblical figures of Abraham, Moses, and others demonstrate a tradition of free thought and criticism of God's actions, emphasizing the importance of reason and conscience. Judaism's universal implications are evident in its acceptance of proselytes and its emphasis on the shared humanity of all people, regardless of race or nationality. Ultimately, the idea of a tribal God is incompatible with the values of justice, love, and inclusivity that are central to Jewish theology and tradition.

Section section_05 (Chars 33964–42196):
Section Summary: The concept of a "Chosen People" is not unique to Judaism, as Germanism has also evolved a similar doctrine of special election. The Bible contains passages that appear to promote violence and vengeance, but these must be considered in their historical context and compared to similar ideas in other cultures. The Jewish tradition has evolved over time, and many of the more primitive concepts and practices have been replaced by more spiritual and ethical ones, as reflected in the Talmud and other Jewish texts. The idea of a uniform, divine Bible is problematic, and a more nuanced understanding of the text as a collection of national literature with varying authorship and historical context is necessary. Ultimately, the Jewish tradition values reason, ethics, and human nature, and has moved beyond its more primitive stages to emphasize these values.

Section section_06 (Chars 42197–50907):
Section Summary: The Talmud's complexity and diversity of voices reflect the free thinking and intellectual richness of post-biblical Israel. Despite its reverence for tradition, Judaism has carried forward its past, including outdated practices, while silently replacing its earlier conception of God with a nobler one. The Old Testament reaches a high ethical note, emphasizing Israel's mission as a "light of the nations" and a force for universal salvation. This ideal is rooted in the concept of a chosen people, not as a privileged elite, but as a servant people tasked with spreading justice and righteousness to all nations. Ultimately, the essence of Judaism lies in its apostolic altruism, with the goal of world-service and the establishment of a kingdom of God, where all humanity will be united under a single divine authority.

Section section_07 (Chars 50908–59153):
Section Summary: The concept of a "tribal God" in Judaism is a misconception, as the Hebrew Bible reveals a universal and cosmic God who cares for all creation, not just the Jewish people. The Old Testament contains passages that express a universalistic view, such as the Psalms and the story of Genesis, which describe God's covenant with all living creatures. The God of the Hebrew Bible is a God of justice, reason, and love, who is not limited to a particular tribe or nation. In fact, the Jewish tradition has a long history of proselytizing and accepting converts, with many non-Jews contributing to Jewish literature and culture. The idea of a universal God is a central theme in Judaism, and it is this universalism that has allowed the religion to transcend its tribal origins and speak to people of all nations and backgrounds.

Section section_08 (Chars 59154–67565):
Section Summary: The concept of the "Chosen People" in Judaism is not about superiority, but rather a sense of responsibility and noblesse oblige. Jewish literature and teachings emphasize the idea that God's mission is not exclusive to the Jewish people, but rather a universal message. The doctrine of election is not about arrogance, but about promoting the "sanctification of the Name" and upholding God's reputation. Other nations, such as America and England, have also developed a sense of national mission and self-consciousness over time, demonstrating that the idea of a "Chosen People" is not unique to Judaism. This concept has evolved through history, with nations assigning themselves a mission and developing a sense of purpose and world-duty.

Section section_09 (Chars 67565–76110):
Section Summary: The concept of British national identity and power emerged in the 13th century, initially tempered by humility and a sense of divine favor. However, by the 18th century, this had given way to a more swaggering militarism, as expressed in the song "Rule, Britannia." The growth of the British Empire was driven by a sense of destiny and a belief in the country's special mission, which was often justified by reference to divine providence. Over time, this mission evolved to become more spiritualized and universal, as seen in the writings of poets like Kipling, who presented Britain as a nation of pioneer martyrs serving a higher purpose. Ultimately, the idea of a national mission is often retrospectively constructed, with nations ascribing purposes to themselves that they were not originally conscious of, and using legend and mythology to explain and justify their achievements.

Section section_10 (Chars 76110–84519):
Section Summary: The concept of a national mission is not diminished by its gradual evolution, and its truth is not measured by objective criteria, but by the nation's commitment to it. The idea of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism, as other nations, such as Japan, have similar beliefs. In contrast to Judaism, Germanism is characterized by a focus on state power and the suppression of individuality, with similarities to ancient pagan constitutions. Germany's mission has been perverted by its emphasis on militarism and industrial prosperity, leading to a ruthless and logical pursuit of power. The author argues that Germanism is not synonymous with Judaism, but rather has analogies with other militaristic nations, and that its ideals are a throwback to a more archaic era.

Section section_11 (Chars 84520–92880):
Section Summary: The author compares the German national anthem with a Jewish prayer, highlighting the difference between Germanism and Judaism. While German writers often glorify their nation, Jewish writers tend to rebuke theirs, seeking truth rather than heroics. The author notes that Jewish literature exposes the flaws of its own heroes, demonstrating a passion for veracity that is unique among nations. In contrast, German literature often glosses over the nation's flaws, and it is often Jewish critics, such as Maximilian Harden, who speak out against German militarism and nationalism. The author suggests that Judaism has a valuable contribution to make to the world, particularly in its emphasis on universalism and its potential to inspire a new era of peace and cooperation.

Section section_12 (Chars 92881–97774):
Section Summary: The speaker reflects on a quote from Lincoln about joining a church that values loving God and one's neighbor, and wonders what has been lacking in the Jewish community. The Jewish people have been silent for too long and must now choose to take action and make their voice heard. The speaker believes that Jews must fight for their own cause and work towards building a better world, as expressed in the poem by Nina Salaman. In the afterword, Dr. Israel Abrahams pays tribute to the memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar who was self-taught but had a great capacity for comradeship in studies. Davis' legacy lives on through his work, particularly his edition of the Festival Prayers, and through his daughters who continue his work.
