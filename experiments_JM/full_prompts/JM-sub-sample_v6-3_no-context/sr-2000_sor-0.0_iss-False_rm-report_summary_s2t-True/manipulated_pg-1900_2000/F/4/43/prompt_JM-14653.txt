You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, suggesting that its magic has been lost for many adults. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, with secrets and surprises building up to the big day. However, as people grow older, they often lose this sense of wonder and enthusiasm. The author argues that this is not just a natural result of aging, but rather a sign of a deeper change in society.

The author notes that children still maintain the spirit of Christmas, but adults often have to force themselves to get into the holiday mood. This is in contrast to other vacations, like summer holidays, where people naturally feel a sense of excitement and relaxation. The author suggests that the decline of Christmas spirit is not just a personal issue, but a societal one.

The author identifies the rise of skepticism and scientific inquiry in the 19th century as a key factor in the decline of Christmas spirit. The work of philosophers and scientists like Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, and Huxley led to a greater emphasis on reason and evidence, which in turn led to a decline in faith and traditional beliefs. This has resulted in a sense of disillusionment and cynicism, with many people feeling that the "bottom has been knocked out of Christmas."

However, the author argues that this is not necessarily the case. While scientific discoveries may have challenged traditional beliefs, they have not diminished the importance of spiritual and moral principles. The author suggests that people are still drawn to the idea of Christmas, even if they do not believe in its traditional trappings. This is evident in the way people strive to keep the Christmas spirit alive, both in themselves and in their children.

The author concludes that the decline of Christmas spirit is not just a result of personal aging or societal change, but rather a complex interplay of factors. Despite this, the author believes that the core principles of Christmas - goodwill, charity, and faith - remain intact and continue to inspire people. Ultimately, the author suggests that people need to re-examine their relationship with Christmas and find a way to reconnect with its deeper meaning and significance. 

The author's argument is that the Christmas spirit is not just a product of childhood innocence, but a profound instinct that reminds people of their place in the universe and their duties to themselves and others. The author believes that this instinct is still present, even if it is often buried beneath layers of cynicism and disillusionment. By acknowledging and embracing this instinct, people can work to revive the true spirit of Christmas and find a sense of meaning and purpose in the holiday season. 

In the end, the author's message is one of hope and renewal. Rather than giving up on Christmas, people should strive to reconnect with its deeper meaning and significance. This can involve embracing the spiritual and moral principles that underlie the holiday, as well as finding new ways to express and celebrate them. By doing so, people can work to revive the Christmas spirit and create a more authentic and meaningful holiday experience. 

The author's reflections on Christmas are not just a nostalgic look back at a bygone era, but a call to action. The author is urging people to think critically about their relationship with Christmas and to find ways to make the holiday more meaningful and significant. This can involve challenging traditional beliefs and practices, as well as embracing new ideas and perspectives. Ultimately, the author believes that this process of reflection and renewal is essential to keeping the Christmas spirit alive. 

The author's use of language and imagery adds to the overall sense of nostalgia and longing that pervades the text. The author's descriptions of Christmas past are vivid and evocative, conjuring up images of a time when the holiday was a more innocent and joyful occasion. The author's use of metaphor and symbolism also adds depth and complexity to the text, highlighting the ways in which Christmas can be seen as a symbol of hope and renewal. 

Overall, the author's argument is that the Christmas spirit is not just a product of childhood innocence, but a profound instinct that reminds people of their place in the universe and their duties to themselves and others. The author believes that this instinct is still present, even if it is often buried beneath layers of cynicism and disillusionment. By acknowledging and embracing this instinct, people can work to revive the true spirit of Christmas and find a sense of meaning and purpose in the holiday season.
