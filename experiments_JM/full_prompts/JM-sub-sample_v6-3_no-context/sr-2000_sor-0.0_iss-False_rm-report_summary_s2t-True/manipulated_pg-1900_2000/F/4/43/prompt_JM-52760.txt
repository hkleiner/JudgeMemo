You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most fighting taking place in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals attempting to capture Richmond, none had succeeded. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan came closest in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of the city. The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the Union failing to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia.

The Confederacy had also failed to settle the issue, with attempted invasions of the North being turned back at Antietam and Gettysburg. However, in the West, the Union had made significant gains, including the capture of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. In 1864, the Union had a new commander, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who was tasked with leading the Army of the Potomac. Grant decided to accompany the army and provide general direction, rather than remaining in Washington.

The Union plan called for a two-pronged attack, with Grant's army targeting Richmond and Petersburg, while Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army targeted Atlanta and the Confederacy's western territories. The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast. The army captured City Point, but was unable to make significant gains.

The Battle of the Wilderness marked the start of the final campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia. The battle resulted in heavy losses on both sides, but the armies remained intact. Grant then moved the Army of the Potomac to the east of Richmond, hoping to outflank the Confederate defenders. However, Lee's army was able to counter each move, and the Union suffered heavy losses at Cold Harbor.

After Cold Harbor, Grant decided to turn his attention to Petersburg, a city of vital importance to the Confederacy due to its railroads and transportation links. The city was defended by a series of fortifications, known as the "Dimmock Line," which were constructed in 1862. The line was 10 miles long and featured 55 artillery batteries, but was vulnerable to attack due to its length and the limited number of troops available to defend it.

On June 15, 1864, the Union army launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and approaching the city. The Union forces outnumbered the Confederate defenders, with 18,000 troops facing less than 4,000. The stage was set for a significant battle, with the fate of Petersburg and the Confederacy hanging in the balance. The Union army's objective was to capture the city and cut off the railroads, which would severely limit the Confederacy's ability to supply its armies. The battle would be a crucial turning point in the war, with the outcome having significant implications for the future of the Confederacy.
