You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator reflects on their early career and how they met George Corvick, who had done more and earned more than them. Corvick asks the narrator for a service, to prepare an article for "The Middle" about Hugh Vereker's new novel. The narrator is excited to read Vereker's work and meet him, as they will be attending the same gathering at Bridges. Corvick has to leave suddenly for Paris to help a friend, Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill.

The narrator reads Vereker's novel and writes a review, trying to do justice to the author's work. Corvick writes from Paris, saying that Mrs. Erme is recovering, but he is disappointed with the narrator's review, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's writing. The narrator attends the gathering at Bridges, where they meet Vereker, but he doesn't seem to have read the review.

Lady Jane, the hostess, discovers the review and praises it, saying that the author has "got at" Vereker. She tries to get Vereker to read it, and he eventually takes the paper to his room. The narrator reveals to Lady Jane that they are the author of the review, but she seems less impressed than expected. At dinner, the narrator waits for Vereker's reaction to the review, but he dismisses it as "the usual twaddle."

Miss Poyle, a guest at the dinner, asks Vereker about the review, and he says that the author doesn't see anything. The narrator is surprised and disappointed by Vereker's response, feeling that they had tried to do justice to his work. Vereker's comment sparks a conversation about his writing and how it is perceived by others. The narrator is left wondering if they truly understood Vereker's work and if their review was accurate.

The narrator's encounter with Vereker and the discussion about the review makes them realize that they may not have fully grasped the author's intentions. They begin to question their own understanding of Vereker's work and the nature of criticism. The experience leaves the narrator with a sense of uncertainty and a desire to delve deeper into Vereker's writing. The narrator's story highlights the challenges of criticism and the complexities of understanding an author's work.
