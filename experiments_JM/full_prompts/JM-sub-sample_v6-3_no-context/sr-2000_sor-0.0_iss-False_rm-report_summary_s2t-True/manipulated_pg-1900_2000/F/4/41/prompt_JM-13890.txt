You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 1538, a writ of summons was sent to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before King Henry VIII. The shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr was destroyed, and his name and memory were erased from records. However, a new enthusiasm for the site of the shrine has led to a growing interest in the Pilgrims' Way from Winchester.

Many modern pilgrims take the train to Canterbury, but some walk the old road, taking in the beautiful hills of Surrey and Kent. The first view of the Cathedral city is a significant moment in the pilgrimage, and those who take the train miss out on this experience. The city of Canterbury has a long history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Palaeolithic Age.

The Romans invaded Britain and established a settlement at Canterbury, which they called Durovernum. The town was an important center for trade and commerce, with five great roads leading to it. After the Romans left Britain, the Anglo-Saxons took over, and the town was rebuilt with new foundations above the old Roman level.

In 597, Augustine landed in Kent and began to preach and instruct the locals in Christianity. The king, Ethelbert, was baptized, and the Saxons soon began to embrace the new faith. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years.

The city has undergone many changes over the centuries, but its association with ecclesiastical control remains strong. The church of St. Martin's is said to be the first church mentioned in history associated with Christian worship, and it is believed to date back to the Roman or Saxon period. Despite the passage of time, Canterbury remains a significant city in English history and a major pilgrimage site.

The Pilgrims' Way from Winchester to Canterbury is a popular route for those seeking to follow in the footsteps of medieval pilgrims. The journey takes in many historic sites and offers stunning views of the countryside. For those who take the time to walk the old road, the experience is a rewarding one, with many opportunities to reflect on the history and significance of the city.

Canterbury's importance extends beyond its religious significance, with a rich cultural and historical heritage. The city has been an important center for trade and commerce for centuries, and its strategic location has made it a key player in English history. Today, Canterbury remains a thriving city, with a strong sense of community and a deep connection to its past.

The story of Canterbury is one of continuity and change, with the city adapting to the needs of its inhabitants over the centuries. From its early days as a Roman settlement to its current status as a major pilgrimage site, Canterbury has remained a significant city in English history. Its association with ecclesiastical control has endured for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center for Christianity in England.

In conclusion, the city of Canterbury is a place of great historical and cultural significance, with a rich heritage and a strong sense of community. Its importance extends beyond its religious significance, with a thriving cultural scene and a deep connection to its past. Whether approached by train or on foot, the city is a rewarding destination for anyone interested in history, culture, or spirituality.
