You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl living in a log house in Plymouth with her father, Bill Mason. Her father is a drunkard, and the town has had enough of his behavior. A wealthy woman, Mrs. Lane, has taken it upon herself to care for Debby and save her from her father's influence. Debby's father is part of a group of men heading to Boston to fight against the King, and he decides to leave Debby behind. 

Debby is heartbroken and refuses to go with Mrs. Lane, but eventually, she is forced to leave her father and her old life behind. She is bound to Mrs. Lane for five years and is forced to adapt to a new and strict way of life. Debby struggles to adjust to her new surroundings and is miserable in her new home. She longs for her father and the freedom she once had. 

Debby's father had given her a drum, which was her one childish toy, and she had learned to play it from him. However, there is no place for the drum in Mrs. Lane's house, and Debby is forced to hide it. She sometimes sneaks away to play the drum, which brings her comfort. 

As time passes, Debby grows stronger and taller, but her heart remains hard and bitter. She remembers her mother, who had died five years earlier, and the stories she used to tell her. Debby's mother had wanted her to be a lady and had asked her to stay with her father and take care of him. 

In the second chapter, Debby is seen sitting idly on the porch, and Mrs. Lane scolds her for not airing her bed and praying for forgiveness. Debby is defiant and refuses to obey Mrs. Lane's rules. She is forbidden from seeing her friend Jack Martin, but she refuses to obey. 

Mrs. Lane chastises Debby and threatens to punish her further if she disobeys again. Debby is sent to her room, where she thinks about her mother and her father. She realizes that she is growing worse and worse and that her chance at a decent life is slipping away. 

Debby thinks about the rumors of battles at Lexington and Bunker Hill and wonders if her father was involved. She hates the King and wishes she could fight against him. As the day comes to a close, Debby knows that Mrs. Lane will come to her room to punish her, and she must decide what to do. 

Debby is torn between obeying Mrs. Lane and following her own path. She is strong-willed and determined, but she is also scared and unsure of what the future holds. As the clock strikes seven, Debby knows that she must make a decision soon. 

The story sets the stage for Debby's journey as she navigates her difficult circumstances and tries to find her place in the world. With her strong spirit and determination, Debby is ready to take on whatever challenges come her way. 

Debby's story is one of resilience and courage in the face of adversity. She is a complex and dynamic character, full of contradictions and flaws. As the story unfolds, Debby will face many challenges and make difficult choices that will shape her future. 

For now, Debby remains in her room, waiting for Mrs. Lane to come and punish her. But as she sits in the darkness, she is already planning her next move, determined to take control of her life and forge her own path. 

The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Debby will not be held back by the constraints of her current life. She will find a way to break free and make her own way in the world. 

As the night wears on, Debby's thoughts turn to her father and the life she left behind. She wonders what he is doing and if he is safe. She hopes that he is fighting for their freedom and that one day they will be reunited. 

Debby's heart remains full of love for her father, and she is determined to follow in his footsteps. She will not be swayed by Mrs. Lane's rules and conventions; instead, she will forge her own path and make her own decisions. 

The stage is set for Debby's journey, and it will be a wild and unpredictable ride. With her courage and determination, Debby will face whatever challenges come her way and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever. 

As the darkness deepens, Debby makes a decision. She will not be held back by Mrs. Lane or the conventions of society. She will take control of her life and make her own way in the world. The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Debby is ready to take on whatever comes next.
