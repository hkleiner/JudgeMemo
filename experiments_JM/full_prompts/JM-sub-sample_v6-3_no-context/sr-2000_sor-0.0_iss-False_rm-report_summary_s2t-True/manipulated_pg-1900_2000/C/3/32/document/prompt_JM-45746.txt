You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their own journey into the teaching profession, which began as a temporary solution after college. Many of their peers viewed teaching as a "fill-in job" rather than a respectable career. The author shares the story of two young men who entered the teaching profession under similar circumstances. One man, who became the president of a local board of education, seemed uninterested in his job and had a lackluster approach to education. In contrast, the second young man was enthusiastic and dedicated to his work, taking initiative to improve the school and its programs.

The author highlights the importance of making teaching a profession rather than just a job. They emphasize the need for young educators to consider their strengths and weaknesses when seeking positions. A pleasing and forceful personality is crucial for a teacher's success, and it should be cultivated to the greatest possible degree. The author recalls being influenced by a principal with an attractive personality, which inspired them to complete their high school education.

When seeking positions, candidates should be honest about their abilities and preferences. Boards of education typically grade applicants based on personality, preparation, and experience. A good general education is essential for teachers, and specializing in one or more subjects should be based on a solid educational foundation. The author notes that mediocre preparation will no longer be accepted in the field of education.

The author also stresses the importance of dressing professionally when applying for positions. They share an anecdote about a young woman who was otherwise qualified but lacked "dress sense," which made her unsuitable for a commercial teaching position. The author advises teachers to continually broaden their general education and utilize every opportunity to improve their skills.

When filling out application blanks, teachers should be careful and accurate in providing information. References should be responsible persons who know the applicant's real qualifications and teaching work. The author encourages applicants to secure permission from their references before using their names. A superintendent is more likely to understand a teacher's motive for applying elsewhere if they have been interviewed.

The author contrasts the approach of two young educators who sought positions. One was motivated by the desire for a higher salary, while the other was driven by a desire to improve professionally and had taken steps to specialize in their chosen field. The author emphasizes the importance of making teaching a profession and encourages young educators to approach their careers with dedication and enthusiasm. By doing so, they can make a positive impact on their students and the education system as a whole.
