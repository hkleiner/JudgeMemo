You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" is written by Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, a distinguished soldier and military expert. The purpose of the pamphlet is to present Russia's role in the recent war. Russia made enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Prussian militarism, with 12,000,000 casualties, including 3,000,000 dead. The country's economic life became overstrained and partially destroyed, leading to the rise of Bolshevism.

According to Colonel Shumsky-Solomonov, Russia's losses were more than twice those of France, four to five times those of England, and more than thirty-five times those of some other countries. The number of Russia's casualties is larger than the total population of several European countries. If Russia had not sacrificed 3,000,000 of its best youth, a Prussian bayonet would now be ruling the world.

Russia played a great role in the recent struggle, particularly in the early stages of the war. The country's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia diverted the entire Austrian army and part of the German army, depriving the enemy of the opportunity to realize their plan to attack France. Russia's efforts also contributed to the early termination of the German offensive in France and compelled the Germans to abstain from their main operations on the Western front for over a year.

In 1915, Russia shouldered the whole burden of the struggle against Germany, Austria, and Turkey, giving the Allies the opportunity to prepare for the coming German offensive at Verdun. In 1916, Russia's Brusilov offensive saved Italy from a critical situation and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme. Russia also took upon itself the blows of the German armies, stopping their advance and undertaking the defense of a considerable stretch of the Romanian front.

The German General Staff was obliged to transfer additional divisions to the Eastern front, and the number of German divisions engaged on the Russian front grew continuously. By the spring of 1917, there were 162 German and Austrian divisions engaged on the Russian front alone. Russia entered the war unprepared, with the Russian Army consisting of millions but having bayonets and guns only for one-tenth of its number.

The great heroism of the Russian soldiers during the first three years of the war was crucial in defeating Prussian militarism. The Russian Armies collapsed in the fall of 1917, but this cannot minimize their heroism. The pamphlet's director, A. J. Sack, notes that Russia's role in the war must be gauged by the efforts made to blast the German war plans and to save the situation at critical moments.

The pamphlet also discusses whether Germany could have won the war. A careful analysis suggests that Germany was close to victory, but the self-sacrifice of the unprepared Russian Army during the first days of the war played an enormous role in preventing this. The plan of the old Field Marshal, Moltke, was to concentrate all forces against France, but Russia's early offensive destroyed this plan.

The recognition of these facts should prompt every impartial historian to admit that Russia's self-sacrifice played a significant role in the war. Unfortunately, the extraordinary conditions that developed in Russia towards the end of the war are obscuring the true historic role of Russia. The pamphlet concludes that Russia's historic role in the war is becoming more and more obscured from public opinion, and that General Ludendorf's memoirs, which attempt to slander the Russian Army, are misleading and use false data.
