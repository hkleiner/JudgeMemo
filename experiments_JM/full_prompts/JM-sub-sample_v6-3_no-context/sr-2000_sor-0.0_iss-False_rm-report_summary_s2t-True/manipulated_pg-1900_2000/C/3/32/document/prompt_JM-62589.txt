# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a 14-year-old girl named Debby living with her father, Bill Mason, in a log house in Plymouth. Her father is a drunkard, and the town has had enough of his behavior. A wealthy woman, Mrs. Lane, has taken it upon herself to care for Debby and has been appointed by the town to take her in. Debby's father is part of a group of men heading to Boston to fight in the Revolution. 

Debby is devastated when her father leaves, and she is forced to stay with Mrs. Lane. She is miserable in her new home, where she is watched, distrusted, and whipped for misdeeds. Debby longs for her father and the life they had together, despite its difficulties. She also misses her drum, which was her one childish toy and a connection to her father. 

Debby had hidden her drum behind their old home to save it from destruction. She sometimes sneaks away to play it, finding comfort in the familiar rhythm. As time passes, Debby grows stronger and taller but remains bitter and hard-hearted. She remembers her mother, who had encouraged her to be a lady and stay with her father. 

Debby's mother had spoken of her own family and home, but Debby never learned more about them. After her mother's death, Debby's life became increasingly difficult, and she was often neglected and uncared for. The town eventually intervened, binding Debby to Mrs. Lane for five years.
