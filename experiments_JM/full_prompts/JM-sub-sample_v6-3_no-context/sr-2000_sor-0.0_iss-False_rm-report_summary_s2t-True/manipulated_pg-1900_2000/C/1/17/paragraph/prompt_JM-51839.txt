You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians. The Tejas Indians lived in the area, building homes and ceremonial mounds, and passing down their stories and traditions through oral retelling. The first European to visit the area was Hernando De Soto in 1541-42, who spent the winter in Nacogdoches and sent out scouting parties to search for the seven cities of the Cibolo.

In 1620, Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda, also known as "the angel in blue," taught the Tejas tribes the Christian religion. The first definite description of Nacogdoches and its aboriginal population is in the account of LaSalle's visit in 1685. LaSalle became ill and remained in Nacogdoches for a month, receiving hospitable treatment from the natives.

The French and Spanish had a significant presence in the area, with the French ceding Louisiana to Spain in 1764. The Spanish garrison in Nacogdoches was abandoned in 1773, but the town was refounded by Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo in 1779. Ybarbo ruled the town as a benevolent despot and promulgated the first Book of Ordinances for the government of the city in 1780.

The town grew rapidly, and by the beginning of the 19th century, it had a population of several hundred people. In 1792, General Don Ramon de Castro sent Don Juan Antonio Cortez to investigate irregularities in land grants made by Ybarbo. Ybarbo was removed from office and replaced by Don Carlos de Zepeda.

Nacogdoches was a loyal Spanish town and played a significant role in the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition in 1800. Nolan had been reared by General James Wilkinson and invaded Texas with a small band of adventurers. The population of the town supported Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his garrison in pursuing and arresting Nolan's band.

Nolan was killed, and the remainder of the expedition were captured and brought back to Nacogdoches. The sole survivor of the band was Peter Ellis Bean, a colorful and resourceful man. The purchase of Louisiana by the United States from the French in 1803 brought about a great change in the political and military affairs of Nacogdoches.

The town's history is also marked by the presence of notable figures such as Red Feather, a heroic leader who taught his people the gentle arts of husbandry. The story of Red Feather is delightfully recounted by Miss Adina de Zavala in her "Origin of the Red Bird." The town's name, Nacogdoches, is derived from the Caddo language and means "place of persimmon trees."

The area was also home to the Hasinai Confederation, a group of Caddo tribes that lived in the region. The confederation was led by a young man named Bernadino, who was given the name by the Spaniards. The Angelina River was named after Bernadino's sister, Angelina, who acted as an interpreter between the Indians and the Spanish explorers.

Overall, Nacogdoches has a rich and complex history, with contributions from the Tejas Indians, the Spanish, the French, and other groups. The town's history is marked by significant events, notable figures, and cultural exchange, making it a unique and fascinating place. The city's archives, including the ancient Spanish parchments, provide valuable information about its history and development.
