You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl living in a log house in Plymouth with her father, Bill Mason. Her father is a drunkard and has joined a group of men heading to Boston to fight in the Revolution. Debby is devastated when her father leaves her behind, and she is forced to live with Mrs. Lane, a strict and wealthy woman who has taken Debby in as a servant.

Debby is heartbroken and feels abandoned by her father. She had always taken care of him and had promised her mother that she would stay with him. Debby's mother had died five years earlier, and since then, Debby had led a wild and uncared-for existence with her father.

Mrs. Lane tries to discipline Debby and teach her to be a lady, but Debby is rebellious and longs for her old life with her father. She remembers her mother's stories and the happy times they had together before her mother's death. Debby also remembers her father's promise to be a better man and to come back to her.

As Debby adjusts to her new life with Mrs. Lane, she becomes more and more miserable. She is forced to do chores and attend church services, which she hates. She also has to deal with the strict rules and punishments imposed by Mrs. Lane. Debby's only comfort is her drum, which she had hidden behind their old home.

Debby's desire for freedom and adventure grows stronger, and she begins to think about running away to join her father. She is inspired by the stories of the Revolution and the bravery of the men who are fighting against the King. Debby hates the King and wants to fight against him, just like her father.

One day, Mrs. Lane discovers that Debby has been seeing Jack Martin, a boy who is considered a rascal by the townspeople. Mrs. Lane forbids Debby from seeing Jack again and punishes her for her disobedience. Debby is furious and hurt, but she also feels a sense of determination and courage.

As the day comes to a close, Debby is forced to stay in her room and think about her behavior. She thinks about her mother and her father, and she wonders what her father is doing and whether he is still alive. Debby's thoughts are filled with anxiety and uncertainty, but she also feels a sense of hope and determination. She knows that she has to make a change and take control of her life.

Debby's story is one of struggle and resilience, as she navigates the challenges of her new life and tries to find her place in the world. She is a strong and courageous girl who is determined to follow her heart and make her own way in life. With her drum as her symbol of freedom and adventure, Debby is ready to take on the world and make her mark.
