You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author describes her experiences in the war zone in France during World War I. She notes that France is divided into two sections: one where life is relatively normal, and the other, the war zone, where access is restricted. To enter the war zone, one needs a special permit, which the author obtains after weeks of effort and influential connections.

The author visits the war zone, starting in Châlons, where she is struck by the silence and stillness of the town. She meets with officials and visits hospitals, including the Savonières hospital near Bar-le-Duc. She is impressed by the efficiency and care of the French military hospitals but notes the lack of certain comforts, such as delicacies, for the convalescent soldiers.

She meets with military officials and is granted access to visit hospitals and other areas of the war zone. She travels by automobile, accompanied by an American officer, and sees the devastation of the war firsthand.

The author reflects on the bravery and resilience of the French people, particularly the women, who are shouldering much of the burden of the war effort.

She concludes by emphasizing the importance of supporting organizations like "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" and contributing to the war effort in any way possible.

The author's experiences in the war zone are marked by a mix of emotions, from shock and horror at the devastation to admiration and respect for the bravery and resilience of the French people. She notes the significant challenges faced by the French military and civilian populations, including the lack of resources, the destruction of infrastructure, and the human cost of the war.

Despite these challenges, the author is impressed by the efficiency and care of the French military hospitals and the dedication of the medical staff. She also notes the importance of organizations like "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" in providing comforts and delicacies to convalescent soldiers, which can help to boost their morale and aid in their recovery.
