You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The document "One Common Faith" discusses the role of religion in addressing the world's challenges. In 2002, an open letter was sent to the world's religious leaders, emphasizing the need for courage to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of God and religion. The letter acknowledged the achievements of the interfaith movement and encouraged religious leaders to face the implications of this truth honestly.

The response to the letter was encouraging, with many recipients expressing distress over the failure of religious institutions to assist humanity. Discussions turned to the need for fundamental change in how people relate to each other, and some recipients reproduced and distributed the letter to other clerics. The task of ensuring that Bahá'u'lláh's message is engaged by people everywhere is one that has been laid primarily on the shoulders of those who have recognized Him.

The accelerating breakdown in social order calls out desperately for the religious spirit to be freed from the shackles that have prevented it from bringing its healing influence. Bahá'ís must draw on a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves. The writings of Bahá'u'lláh provide insights that can help elevate discussion of religious issues above sectarian and transient considerations.

The period of history now opening is expected to be more receptive to efforts to spread Bahá'u'lláh's message. A sea change in human consciousness is underway, driven by the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise and the effects of global integration. The world is experiencing a groundswell of anxiety and discontent, with ancient sectarian conflicts re-emerging and a search for meaning that cannot be evaded.

The primary agents of spiritual development have been the great religions, which have served as a source of knowledge that totally embraces consciousness. However, the search for meaning is now diffused, individualistic, and incoherent in character. The scriptures have not changed, but the moral principles they contain have lost none of their validity.

The dilemma facing the world is artificial and self-inflicted, with misconceptions about human nature and social evolution severely inhibiting efforts at human betterment. The world order is characterized by confusion surrounding the subject of religion, with different conceptions of what religion means. The teachings of Bahá'u'lláh cut through this tangle of inconsistent views and reformulate many truths that have lain at the heart of all Divine revelation.

Religion is not merely a code of laws or a set of rituals, but a principal force impelling the development of consciousness. The intervention of God cultivates the qualities of mind and heart latent in the human species, and its heroes and saints are the heroes and saints of all stages in the struggle. The recurring proof of the existence of God is that He has repeatedly manifested Himself, and the vast epic of humanity's religious history represents the fulfillment of the Covenant, the enduring promise by which the Creator assures the race of the unfailing guidance essential to its spiritual and moral development.

The objection most commonly raised against this conception of religion is the assertion that the differences among the revealed faiths are so fundamental that to present them as stages or aspects of one unified system of truth does violence to the facts. However, the differences referred to fall into the categories of either practice or doctrine, both of which are presented as the intent of the relevant scriptures.

The concept of progressive revelation places the ultimate emphasis on recognition of the revelation of God at its appearance. The failure of the generality of humankind in this respect has condemned entire populations to a ritualistic repetition of ordinances and practices long after these latter have fulfilled their purpose and now merely stultify moral advance.

The power through which the goals of unity and global betterment will be progressively realized is that of unity itself. Although to Bahá'ís this is an obvious truth, its implications for the current crisis of civilization appear to escape most contemporary discourse. The achievement of genuine unity of mind and heart among peoples whose experiences are deeply at variance is thought to be entirely beyond the capacity of society's existing institutions.

The Bahá'í community is a global community that reflects the oneness of humankind, with several million people from virtually every ethnic, cultural, social, and religious background on earth. The community administers its collective affairs without the intervention of a clergy, through democratically elected institutions. The many thousands of localities in which it has put down its roots are to be found in every country, territory, and significant island group, from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego, from Africa to the Pacific.

The culture of systematic growth taking root in the Bahá'í community is the most effective response the friends can make to the challenge discussed in these pages. The experience of an intense and ongoing immersion in the Creative Word progressively frees one from the grip of materialistic assumptions and develops a capacity to assist the yearning for unity on the part of friends and acquaintances to find mature and intelligent expression.

One of the distinguishing features of modernity has been the universal awakening of historical consciousness. The whole body of humanity's sacred texts places the drama of salvation itself squarely in the context of history. The declared purpose
