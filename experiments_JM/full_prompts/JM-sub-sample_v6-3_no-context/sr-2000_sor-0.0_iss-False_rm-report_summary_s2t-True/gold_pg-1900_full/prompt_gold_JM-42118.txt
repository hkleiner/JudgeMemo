You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. He grew up in a romantic and beautiful town surrounded by olive trees and the Mediterranean Sea. Fragonard's father wanted him to follow in his footsteps, but the young boy was drawn to art. At 16, his mother took him to Paris to meet the great painter François Boucher, who became his mentor.

Fragonard trained under Boucher and later under Chardin, where he learned to paint still-life and master his craft. He won the Prix de Rome in 1752 and spent three years in Rome, where he was influenced by the works of Tiepolo and the Italian landscape. Upon his return to Paris, he became known for his decorative paintings and was introduced to the wealthy and influential Bergeret de Grandcour, who became his patron.

Fragonard's art flourished, and he became the mirror of the court, painting scenes of gallantry and everyday life. He married Marie Anne Gérard in 1769, and she became his model and muse. The couple had two children, and Fragonard's art took on a new sense of warmth and intimacy. He continued to paint for the wealthy elite, including the Du Barry, who rejected his most famous work, "The Progress of Love."

The French Revolution brought an end to Fragonard's success, and he struggled to adapt to the new artistic style. He lost his patronage and his livelihood, and his family suffered greatly. In 1793, he fled to Grasse, where he lived in exile for several years. He returned to Paris in 1800, but his art was no longer in fashion, and he died on August 22, 1806, at the age of 74.

Fragonard's legacy was forgotten for many years, but he is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of the 18th century. His art embodies the spirit of the French Rococo period, and his paintings are characterized by their elegance, charm, and sense of joy. Fragonard's story is a testament to the power of art to transcend time and circumstance, and his work continues to delight and inspire audiences today.

The Revolution had a profound impact on Fragonard's life and art, and he struggled to come to terms with the new regime. He was forced to adapt to a new style of art, which emphasized classical and heroic themes, but he was unable to reconcile his own artistic vision with the demands of the Revolution. Despite his struggles, Fragonard remained a prolific artist, and his work continued to reflect his love of beauty, elegance, and joy.

In the end, Fragonard's art was rediscovered, and he is now celebrated as one of the greatest painters of the 18th century. His legacy is a testament to the enduring power of art to bring joy and beauty into our lives, even in the darkest of times. Fragonard's story is a reminder that art can transcend time and circumstance, and that the beauty and elegance of his paintings will continue to inspire and delight audiences for generations to come.
