You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of Judaism. The foreword, written by Herbert Samuel, introduces the series of lectures in memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar of Hebrew language and literature. Davis was a self-taught expert who made significant contributions to the field, including a volume on Hebrew accents and a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book.

The first chapter discusses the idea of a chosen people and how it has been perceived by others, including the ancient Greeks and Romans. The author argues that the concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism and that other nations, such as Germany, have also claimed a special status.

The second chapter examines the biblical concept of a chosen people and how it has been interpreted throughout history. The author suggests that the idea of a chosen people is not about superiority, but rather about a special mission to serve the world. The chapter also explores the tension between particularism and universalism in Jewish thought.

The third chapter discusses the development of Jewish ritual and practice, including the adaptation of idolatrous practices to a purer worship. The author argues that Judaism has evolved over time, incorporating new ideas and practices while maintaining its core values.

The fourth chapter explores the concept of election in Judaism, arguing that it is not about arrogance or superiority, but rather about a sense of responsibility to serve the world. The author examines the idea of a chosen people in the context of Jewish liturgy and prayer, highlighting the emphasis on serving God and promoting justice and righteousness.

The fifth chapter compares the concept of a chosen people in Judaism to that in other nations, including Germany and England. The author argues that the idea of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism and that other nations have also claimed a special status. The chapter also explores the development of national missions and how they are often retrospective, with nations ascribing purposes to themselves that they were originally unconscious of.

The sixth chapter discusses the differences between Judaism and Germanism, arguing that while both may claim a special status, they are fundamentally different in their values and ideals. The author suggests that Germanism is more akin to Japanese Bushido, with its emphasis on loyalty and sacrifice to the state, whereas Judaism emphasizes individuality and moral responsibility.

The seventh chapter reflects on the current state of the world and the need for a new "City of God" to be built on the wreckage of civilization. The author argues that Judaism has a contribution to make to this effort, with its emphasis on justice, compassion, and universalism. The chapter also explores the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, suggesting that the two faiths have more in common than is often acknowledged.

The eighth chapter concludes the book by emphasizing the need for Judaism to re-engage with the world and to promote its values of justice, compassion, and universalism. The author argues that the time has come for Jews to fight for their ideals and to build a new Jerusalem, not just in Palestine, but in every land.

The afterword, written by Dr. Israel Abrahams, pays tribute to Arthur Davis and his contributions to Jewish scholarship. Abrahams reflects on Davis's love of learning and his ability to inspire others, highlighting his work on Hebrew accents and his edition of the Festival Prayer Book. The afterword concludes by emphasizing the importance of Davis's legacy and the need for continued scholarship and learning in the Jewish community.
