You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet was a prominent painter of peasant life, known for his profound and sympathetic renderings of everyday life. He was born on October 4, 1814, in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, to a peasant family. Millet's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was encouraged by his family to pursue his artistic talents. He began drawing at a young age and was eventually sent to Cherbourg to study with a local painter, Mouchel.

Millet's time in Cherbourg was cut short when his father died, and he returned home to help with the farm. However, he continued to draw and eventually decided to pursue a career in art. In 1837, he moved to Paris, where he studied at the Louvre and was exposed to the works of great masters such as Mantegna and Michelangelo. Millet was particularly drawn to the Italian Renaissance and the works of Nicolas Poussin.

Despite his talent, Millet struggled to make a name for himself in Paris. He was rejected by the Salon and faced criticism from the art establishment. However, he persevered and continued to paint, eventually developing a style that was characterized by its simplicity, sincerity, and profound understanding of peasant life.

In 1849, Millet moved to Barbizon, a small village on the outskirts of Paris, where he joined a community of artists who shared his passion for naturalism and realism. It was during this period that he produced some of his most famous works, including "The Gleaners" and "The Angelus." These paintings showcased his ability to capture the beauty and dignity of peasant life, and they helped to establish him as a leading figure in the art world.

Millet's life was marked by financial struggles and personal tragedy, including the loss of his first wife and the death of his friend and fellow artist, Théodore Rousseau. However, he continued to paint, driven by his passion for art and his desire to capture the essence of peasant life. Today, Millet is recognized as one of the greatest painters of the 19th century, and his works are celebrated for their beauty, simplicity, and profound humanity.

Millet's art is characterized by its emphasis on the everyday lives of peasants, and his paintings often feature scenes of rural life, such as farming, harvesting, and domestic chores. He was particularly interested in capturing the struggles and hardships faced by peasants, and his paintings often convey a sense of melancholy and introspection.

Despite his success, Millet remained humble and dedicated to his art. He continued to paint until his death on January 20, 1875, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful and profound works that continue to inspire and influence artists to this day. Millet's influence can be seen in the works of many other artists, including Segantini, who was deeply influenced by Millet's style and themes.

Overall, Millet's life and art are a testament to the power of passion and dedication. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, he remained true to his vision and continued to paint, leaving behind a body of work that is both beautiful and profound. His legacy continues to inspire and influence artists, and his paintings remain some of the most celebrated and beloved works of the 19th century.
