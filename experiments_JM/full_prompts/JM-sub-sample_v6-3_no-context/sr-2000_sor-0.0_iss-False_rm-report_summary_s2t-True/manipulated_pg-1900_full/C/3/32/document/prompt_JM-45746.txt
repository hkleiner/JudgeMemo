You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their journey to becoming a schoolmaster, initially considering it an unappealing profession. However, after graduating from college, they decided to pursue teaching as a temporary solution. The author shares two contrasting experiences of young men who entered the teaching profession, one who made it a job and another who made it a profession.

To succeed in the teaching profession, one must consider their strengths and weaknesses. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in securing a teaching position. A pleasing personality is crucial, and teachers should strive to make a good impression. The author also highlights the need for proper dress sense and a good general education.

In addition to personal qualities, teachers must be prepared to specialize in a particular subject and continuously broaden their general education. The author advises against being careless when filling out application forms and emphasizes the importance of securing responsible references.

As a superintendent, the author attended teachers' meetings, which they found to be highly beneficial. They suggest that teachers' meetings should be conducted in a way that provides tangible and definite assistance to teachers. The author also discusses the importance of personal talks between the superintendent and teachers to understand their difficulties and offer suggestions.

The author shares their experience of working with a janitor, who initially seemed uncooperative but eventually became a valuable ally. They emphasize the importance of treating all employees with respect and kindness, regardless of their position. The author also discusses the role of the principal in helping teachers, including providing professional assistance, administrative support, and personal relationships.

The principal can help teachers by providing assistance with exceptional children, interpreting the course of study, and offering professional leadership. In an administrative way, the principal can help by furnishing supplies and equipment, providing definite directions, and managing the building load. In personal relationships, the principal should demonstrate higher human qualities, such as approachability and a willingness to listen.

The author highlights the importance of the school's relationship with the community, particularly in adjusting boys and girls to proper vocations. They suggest that schools should study the industrial and commercial conditions in their locality and offer special subjects accordingly. The author also emphasizes the need for vocational guidance and provides an example of a successful club organization that helped pupils choose their vocations.

Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of creating a positive and supportive environment in schools, where teachers, principals, and superintendents work together to provide the best possible education for students. By doing so, they can help students adjust to their future vocations and become valuable members of society. The author concludes that the schoolmaster of tomorrow must be aware of the changing conditions in social and industrial life and make readjustments in the program of education accordingly.
