You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, noting that it has lost some of its magic. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it can feel like a chore. The author suggests that this is because people have lost faith in the idea of Christmas, and that the festival has become more about gluttony and expensiveness than about goodwill and kindness.

The author argues that the decline of Christmas is not just a subjective phenomenon, but rather a result of the changing values and beliefs of society. The rise of science and skepticism has led to a decline in faith and a focus on more practical and material concerns. However, the author believes that Christmas can still be a time for celebration and joy, as long as people focus on the values of goodwill and kindness.

The author notes that the date of Christmas was chosen to coincide with the winter solstice, a time of renewal and hope. The festival has been preserved and passed down through the centuries, and its customs and traditions continue to evoke a sense of wonder and magic. The author argues that the key to revitalizing Christmas is to focus on the cultivation of goodwill, and to make a conscious effort to think about and appreciate the people in our lives.

The author suggests that one way to cultivate goodwill is to practice sympathetic imagination, or the ability to put oneself in another person's shoes. This can be done by taking the time to think about and understand the people in our lives, and to appreciate their struggles and challenges. The author argues that this kind of imagination is essential for building strong relationships and creating a sense of community.

The author also notes that the cultivation of goodwill is not just about grand gestures or heroic acts, but about small, everyday actions and decisions. It is about being mindful of the people around us, and taking the time to appreciate and acknowledge them. The author suggests that this kind of mindfulness can be practiced in many different ways, such as through gift-giving, volunteering, or simply being present for others.

In the end, the author believes that Christmas can still be a time of joy and celebration, as long as people focus on the values of goodwill and kindness. By cultivating goodwill and practicing sympathetic imagination, we can create a sense of community and connection that will last throughout the year. The author concludes by noting that the true meaning of Christmas is not just about presents or festivities, but about the values of love, kindness, and generosity that it represents.

The author also discusses the idea that people often make New Year's resolutions, but these resolutions often fail because they are based on unrealistic expectations. The author suggests that instead of making grand resolutions, people should focus on making small, incremental changes in their lives. The author also notes that the idea of perfection is an illusion, and that life is inherently imperfect and messy.

Ultimately, the author believes that the key to happiness is not to strive for perfection, but to accept and appreciate the imperfections of life. The author suggests that people should focus on cultivating a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the good things in their lives, rather than constantly striving for something more. By doing so, people can create a sense of happiness and fulfillment that is not dependent on external circumstances, but rather on their own inner state of mind.
