You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Egypt, containing correspondence between Egyptian pharaohs and their vassals in Asia. The tablets were written in Babylonian cuneiform and date back to the 18th dynasty, around 1400 B.C. They provide valuable insights into the politics, diplomacy, and culture of the ancient Near East. The pharaohs, including Amenophis III and IV, exchanged letters with kings and vassals in Asia, discussing trade, marriage alliances, and military campaigns.

The tablets reveal a complex web of relationships between Egypt and its vassals, with the pharaohs exerting control over their territories through a system of governors and officials. The vassals, in turn, were expected to provide tribute, military support, and loyalty to the pharaoh. However, the system was often plagued by corruption, rebellion, and external threats, including the rise of the Hittite empire.

One of the most significant correspondents was Tushratta, the king of Mitani, who exchanged letters with Amenophis III and IV. Tushratta's letters are notable for their elaborate language and diplomatic protocol, as well as their revelations about the politics and culture of Mitani. The tablets also contain letters from other vassals, including Rib-Addi of Gebal and Aziru of Amurru, who often complained about the actions of their neighbors and requested military support from the pharaoh.

The tablets provide evidence of the widespread use of Babylonian cuneiform as a diplomatic language, as well as the importance of trade and commerce in the ancient Near East. They also reveal the complexities of ancient Near Eastern politics, including the rise and fall of empires, the role of diplomacy and marriage alliances, and the impact of external threats on regional stability.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has been significant for the field of ancient Near Eastern studies, providing a unique window into the politics, culture, and society of the region during the 18th dynasty. The tablets have also shed light on the history of the Hebrews, who are mentioned in several of the letters as a group living in the region of Canaan.

Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are a valuable resource for understanding the ancient Near East during a period of significant cultural, political, and economic change. They provide a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of ancient diplomacy, trade, and politics, and continue to be an important area of study for scholars today. The tablets have also helped to reconstruct the history of the region, including the rise and fall of empires and the impact of external threats on regional stability.
