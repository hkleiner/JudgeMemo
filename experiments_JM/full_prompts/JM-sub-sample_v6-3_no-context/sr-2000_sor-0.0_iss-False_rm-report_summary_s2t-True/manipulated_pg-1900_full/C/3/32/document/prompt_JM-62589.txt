You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl who lives with her father, Bill Mason, in a log house. Her father is a drunkard and has joined a crew of men headed for Boston. Debby's mother had died five years prior, and she has been living a wild and uncared-for existence. Mrs. Lane, a wealthy woman, takes Debby in and tries to save her from her father's influence. However, Debby is miserable in her new home and longs for her father.

Debby discovers that her father has been wounded in a battle and is now sober. She decides to run away from Mrs. Lane's home and join the army as a drummer boy, disguising herself as a boy named Robert Shirtliffe. She meets a boy named Jack Martin, who helps her on her journey. Debby, now known as Robert, joins the American army and becomes a drummer boy.

Robert meets a British soldier named Morley, who looks identical to her. Morley is searching for a girl named Debby Mason, and Robert is shocked by the coincidence. Robert and Morley have a series of encounters, during which Robert learns that Morley is searching for her. Robert also discovers that Morley is the son of a British woman who may be related to her.

As the war progresses, Robert becomes embroiled in a series of battles and skirmishes. She meets General Washington and is tasked with delivering a message to the Marblehead fishermen. Robert is wounded in a battle and left for dead, but is rescued by a surgeon named Doctor Bell. Doctor Bell nurses Robert back to health and discovers her true identity as Debby Mason.

Debby is forced to confront the consequences of her actions and decides to reveal her true identity to General Washington. She is given an honorable discharge from the army and a sum of money to start a new life. Doctor Bell takes Debby to his mother's home, where she begins to rebuild her life. Debby eventually travels to England to meet her relatives and learns that she is the cousin of the boy she killed in battle.

Debby's story comes full circle as she finds a sense of belonging and purpose with her newfound family. She also finds love with Doctor Bell, who accepts her for who she is. The story concludes with Debby and Doctor Bell starting a new life together, with Debby finally finding the happiness and fulfillment she has been searching for. Jack Martin, the boy who helped Debby on her journey, also finds a new sense of purpose and becomes a part of Debby's new family.
