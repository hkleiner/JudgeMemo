You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Paolo Veronese was a renowned painter from Verona, born in 1528. He was known for his unique style, which blended fantasy and realism. Veronese's artwork was characterized by its vivid colors, intricate details, and grandiose settings. He was particularly famous for his depiction of luxurious scenes, often featuring wealthy patrons and exotic objects.

Veronese's early life was marked by his training under his uncle, Antonio Badile, and his father, Gabriele Caliari, a sculptor. He later moved to Venice, where he was influenced by the city's grandeur and opulence. Veronese's artwork was heavily influenced by the Venetian school, and he became known as one of the greatest painters of his time.

One of Veronese's most famous works is "The Wedding at Cana," which features a grand feast with numerous guests, including Jesus and his disciples. The painting is notable for its vivid colors and intricate details, showcasing Veronese's mastery of composition and technique. Veronese's other notable works include "The Feast at the House of Levi" and "The Family of Darius at the Feet of Alexander."

Veronese's career was marked by his collaborations with other notable artists, including Tintoretto and Titian. He was also known for his disinterestedness and refusal to seek wealth or fame, often accepting modest payments for his work. Despite this, Veronese's artwork was highly sought after by wealthy patrons, including the Duke of Savoy and the Emperor Rudolph II.

In his later years, Veronese continued to paint with remarkable skill and energy, producing numerous masterpieces until his death in 1588. His legacy as one of the greatest painters of all time remains unchanged, with his artwork continuing to inspire and awe art lovers to this day. Veronese's unique style and technique have had a lasting impact on the art world, and his paintings remain some of the most celebrated and iconic works of the Renaissance.

Veronese's artwork was not without controversy, however. He was summoned before the Inquisition in 1573 to answer questions about his depiction of religious scenes, which were deemed irreverent by some. Despite this, Veronese remained true to his artistic vision, continuing to paint with passion and creativity until the end of his life.

Throughout his career, Veronese was known for his incredible productivity, producing numerous paintings and frescoes for churches, palaces, and private patrons. His artwork can be found in many of the great museums and galleries of the world, including the Louvre and the National Gallery in London. Veronese's legacy is a testament to his boundless creativity and innovative spirit, and his artwork continues to inspire and delight art lovers to this day.
