You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator, a literary critic, recalls his encounter with George Corvick, who had been tasked with reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel. Corvick was unable to read the book before leaving for Paris, and the narrator took on the task. He met Vereker at a dinner party and was impressed by his intelligence and wit. Vereker revealed to the narrator that his books contained a hidden meaning, a "figure in the carpet," that no critic had ever discovered.

The narrator became obsessed with uncovering this hidden meaning, but his attempts were unsuccessful. Corvick, who had been searching for the meaning as well, eventually discovered it, but died before he could share it with the narrator. Corvick's wife, Gwendolen, also knew the secret, but refused to share it with the narrator.

The narrator continued to pursue the secret, even after Corvick's death, and eventually met Gwendolen again. She still refused to share the secret, and the narrator realized that she had been using it as a way to keep him at bay. Gwendolen eventually married Drayton Deane, a literary critic, and the narrator assumed that she had shared the secret with him.

However, when the narrator met Deane, he discovered that Gwendolen had not shared the secret with him. Deane was unaware of the hidden meaning in Vereker's books and was not interested in uncovering it. The narrator was shocked and disappointed by this revelation, realizing that he had been mistaken in his assumptions about Gwendolen and Deane.

The narrator reflected on his obsession with uncovering the secret and how it had consumed him. He realized that he had been foolish to think that he could uncover the meaning and that it was likely that Vereker had taken the secret to his grave. The narrator's obsession had also damaged his relationships with others, including Gwendolen and Deane.

In the end, the narrator was left with nothing but his own disappointment and frustration. He had been unable to uncover the secret, and it seemed that no one else would be able to either. The narrator's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and the importance of respecting the boundaries of others.

The narrator's encounter with Vereker had a profound impact on him, and he was unable to shake off the feeling that he had missed something important. He continued to think about Vereker and his books, wondering what the hidden meaning could be. The narrator's obsession with Vereker's secret had become an all-consuming force in his life, and he was unable to escape it.

The narrator's relationship with Gwendolen was also affected by his obsession. He had become fixated on the idea that she knew the secret and was withholding it from him. This fixation had damaged their relationship, and the narrator was left feeling frustrated and disappointed.

In the end, the narrator was left to ponder the mystery of Vereker's secret. He realized that he would never know the truth and that the secret would remain hidden forever. The narrator's story serves as a reminder that some secrets are meant to remain hidden, and that the pursuit of knowledge can sometimes be a futile endeavor.
