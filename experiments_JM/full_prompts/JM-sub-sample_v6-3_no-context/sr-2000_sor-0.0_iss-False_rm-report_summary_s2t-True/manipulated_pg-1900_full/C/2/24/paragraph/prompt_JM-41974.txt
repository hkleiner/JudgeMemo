You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Paolo Veronese was a renowned painter from Verona, born in 1528. He was known for his unique style, which was characterized by his use of color and his ability to create a sense of joy and luxury in his paintings. Veronese was trained by his uncle, Antonio Badile, and later by Giovanni Carotto. He was influenced by the works of Titian, Tintoretto, and other Venetian painters.

Veronese's early work was marked by his use of severe and imaginative techniques, which he learned from copying the engravings of Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden. He gained recognition at a young age and was commissioned to paint a Madonna for the Church of San Bernardino. His work was praised by the cardinal, Ercole di Gonzaga, who commissioned him to paint a picture for the cathedral at Mantua.

Veronese moved to Venice in 1555, where he was exposed to the city's vibrant culture and artistic scene. He was fascinated by the city's opulence and grandeur, which is reflected in his paintings. He became known for his ability to capture the essence of Venice and its people, and his paintings often featured scenes of everyday life, as well as mythological and historical themes.

Veronese's most famous works include "The Wedding at Cana" and "The Feast at the House of Levi." These paintings showcase his use of color and his ability to create a sense of movement and energy. He was also known for his use of accessories, such as vases, furniture, and clothing, which added to the overall sense of luxury and opulence in his paintings.

Despite his success, Veronese faced criticism from some who felt that his paintings were too lavish and irreverent. He was summoned before the Inquisition in 1573 to answer charges of heresy, but he was able to defend his work and avoid punishment. Veronese continued to paint until his death in 1588, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful and vibrant works of art.

Throughout his career, Veronese was known for his prolific output and his ability to work quickly and efficiently. He was able to satisfy the demands of his patrons, who included some of the most powerful and wealthy people in Venice. Despite his success, Veronese remained humble and dedicated to his craft, and he continued to innovate and experiment with new techniques until the end of his life.

Veronese's paintings can be found in museums and galleries around the world, including the Louvre in Paris and the National Gallery in London. His work continues to be celebrated for its beauty, its sense of joy and luxury, and its ability to capture the essence of Venice and its people. Veronese's legacy is a testament to the power of art to bring people together and to create a sense of wonder and awe. He remains one of the most beloved and respected painters in history, and his work continues to inspire and delight people to this day.
