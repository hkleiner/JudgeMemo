You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jim Felton, a miner, is struggling to find gold in Sweet Briar Gulch. He receives a letter from his lover, Anne, who refuses to marry him due to his lack of financial stability. Jim is heartbroken and feels like giving up. His friend, Bud, a mail carrier, visits him and offers to help. Bud tells Jim about a boy who was being abused by his supposed father and Jim decides to take the boy in.

The boy, named Ches, is a street-smart kid from the city who has been through a lot. Jim and Ches start to bond, and Jim begins to teach him about the wilderness and mining. Ches is fascinated by the natural world and eager to learn. Jim and Ches go on a hunting trip, where they encounter a mountain lion, and Jim tries to catch it with his bare hands.

After their adventure, Jim and Ches return to their cabin, where Jim resumes his mining work. However, the tunnel collapses, and Jim is trapped. Ches, despite his fear, bravely navigates the treacherous tunnel to find Jim and calls for help. Bud arrives, and together they manage to rescue Jim with the help of a group of miners.

The miners, led by Captain Hanrahan, are experienced and efficient, and they work quickly to free Jim. After the rescue, Jim is injured and weak, but grateful to his friends for saving his life. Bud stays with Jim to help him recover, and Ches assists with the chores. Jim receives a letter from Anne, who has had a change of heart and is now willing to marry him regardless of his financial situation.

Jim is overjoyed and feels like he can finally rest easy. The story ends on a positive note, with Jim, Ches, and Bud enjoying each other's company and looking forward to a brighter future. The natural world around them is also flourishing, with the sunset, creek, and wildlife all contributing to a sense of peace and happiness. Jim's luck seems to be changing, and he is grateful for the support of his friends and the love of his life, Anne.
