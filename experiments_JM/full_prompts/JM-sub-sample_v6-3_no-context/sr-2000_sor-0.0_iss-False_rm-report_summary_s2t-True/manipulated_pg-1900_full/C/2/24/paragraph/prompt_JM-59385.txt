You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story revolves around Kuei Ping, a Chinese woman, and her journey towards self-discovery and freedom. She learns about the concept of World Fellowship from the women of China and is inspired by the idea of a universal connection among women. Kuei Ping's life takes a significant turn when she is betrothed to Chia Fuh Tang, a man ten years her senior, as per the customs of her family.

As she prepares for her wedding, Kuei Ping is torn between her desire for freedom and the traditional expectations of her family. She is drawn to the idea of personal choice and freedom, which is influenced by her interactions with her American teacher, Miss Porter. Despite the constraints of her traditional upbringing, Kuei Ping finds solace in her relationships with her family members, particularly her grandmother, Madame Yen.

Kuei Ping's marriage to Fuh Tang is a significant milestone in her life, and she struggles to balance her desire for independence with the responsibilities of being a wife and daughter-in-law. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son, Bo Te, and later, a second child who dies in infancy. Fuh Tang's health declines, and he becomes addicted to opium, causing a rift in their relationship.

As Kuei Ping navigates the challenges of her life, she finds comfort in her faith and the teachings of Jesus. She begins to see the world in a new light and starts to question the traditional customs and expectations of her family. Kuei Ping's journey is marked by her desire for freedom, self-discovery, and a deeper understanding of the world around her.

The story takes a turn when Kuei Ping's husband, Fuh Tang, passes away, leaving her to care for their children alone. She faces numerous challenges, including financial struggles and the responsibility of raising her children. Despite these difficulties, Kuei Ping remains determined to create a better life for herself and her family.

Years later, Kuei Ping's son, Kwan Wa, grows up and gets married, and she is finally able to realize her dream of building a school and a church in her village. The school and church become a symbol of her newfound freedom and her desire to share her knowledge and faith with others. Kuei Ping's story is one of resilience, hope, and the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.

The narrator of the story becomes Kuei Ping's pupil and learns about her life and experiences. Through their conversations, the narrator gains a deeper understanding of Kuei Ping's journey and the challenges she faced. The story concludes with Kuei Ping's dream of building a school and a church finally coming true, and she is able to share her knowledge and faith with the children of her village.

Kuei Ping's life is a testament to the human spirit's ability to adapt, overcome, and find meaning in the face of adversity. Her story is a powerful reminder of the importance of faith, family, and community in shaping our lives and helping us navigate the challenges we face. The narrator is inspired by Kuei Ping's story and is grateful for the opportunity to learn from her and share in her experiences.
