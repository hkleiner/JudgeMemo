You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets are letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters reveal the political situation in Western Asia during the 14th century BC, with Egypt's influence waning and the Habiri, a group of nomadic tribes, expanding their territory.

The tablets also contain letters from foreign kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters show that the Egyptian king was considered equal to other monarchs, but his reluctance to give away his daughters in marriage caused difficulties in diplomatic relations. The tablets also reveal the character of Pharaoh Akhenaten, who was known for his religious reforms and his attempts to demonstrate the strength of his throne.

The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Aziru, Rib-Addi, and Abdi-Kheba, provide insight into the political situation in Syria and Canaan. They describe the conflicts between different city-states and the struggles against the Habiri. The letters also show the importance of the Egyptian official Yanhamu, who played a significant role in the region.

The tablets also contain information about the geography and administration of the region. They mention various cities, including Jerusalem, and describe the relationships between different rulers and their subjects. The letters also provide insight into the social and cultural practices of the time, including the use of cuneiform writing and the importance of gift-giving in diplomatic relations.

The Tell el Amarna period was marked by significant political changes, including the rise of the Hittite empire and the decline of Mitani. The tablets provide valuable information about the history of Western Asia during this period and offer a unique glimpse into the politics, culture, and society of the ancient Near East.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has been significant for the field of ancient Near Eastern studies, providing new insights into the history and culture of the region. The tablets have also been important for the study of the Bible, as they provide historical context for the biblical account of the conquest of Canaan.

Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource, offering a unique perspective on the politics, culture, and society of the ancient Near East during the 14th century BC. They provide valuable information about the history of Western Asia, the rise and fall of empires, and the relationships between different rulers and their subjects.
