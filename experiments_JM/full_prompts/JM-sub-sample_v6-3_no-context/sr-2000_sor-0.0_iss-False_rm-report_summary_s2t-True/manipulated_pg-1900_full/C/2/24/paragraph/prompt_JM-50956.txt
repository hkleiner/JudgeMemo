You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" discusses Russia's significant contribution to the Allied effort during World War I. The author, Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, highlights Russia's enormous sacrifices, including 12 million casualties, and its crucial role in thwarting Germany's plans. Russia's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia forced Germany to divert troops from the Western front, ultimately leading to the defeat of the German army.

The pamphlet also addresses the attempts by German General Ludendorf to distort the truth about Russia's role in the war. Ludendorf's memoirs are criticized for containing false information and exaggerations about Russian troop numbers and German victories. The author argues that Russia's actions, including the Brusilov offensive, were instrumental in saving Italy and facilitating the Allied victory on the Somme.

Russia's losses were staggering, with 3 million killed and 6 million wounded. The country's sacrifices were greater than those of any other Allied nation, and its role in the war was crucial to the ultimate defeat of Germany. The pamphlet concludes that Russia's participation in the war was essential to the Allied victory and that the country's immense sacrifices will always be remembered.

The author also discusses the consequences of the war for Russia, including the rise of Bolshevism and the country's subsequent decline. However, the author believes that Russia will eventually recover and become a powerful nation once again. The pamphlet emphasizes the importance of recognizing Russia's significant contribution to the Allied effort and the need for Western statesmen to consider the country's future role in European politics.

In 1915, Russia single-handedly fought against Germany, Austria, and Turkey, and although the country was unprepared and lacked arms and munitions, it still managed to divert German forces and give the Allies time to prepare for the next German offensive. The following year, Russia launched the Brusilov offensive, which saved Italy and facilitated the Allied victory on the Somme.

The pamphlet also highlights the significance of Russia's role in the war, including its ability to draw German forces away from the Western front and its contribution to the ultimate defeat of Germany. The author argues that Russia's sacrifices were not in vain and that the country's participation in the war was essential to the Allied victory.

Overall, the pamphlet provides a detailed account of Russia's significant contribution to the Allied effort during World War I and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the country's immense sacrifices. The author believes that Russia will eventually recover and become a powerful nation once again, and that Western statesmen must consider the country's future role in European politics.
