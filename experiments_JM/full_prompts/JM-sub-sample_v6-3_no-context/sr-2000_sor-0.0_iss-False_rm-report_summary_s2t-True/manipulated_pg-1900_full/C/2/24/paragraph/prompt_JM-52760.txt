You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most of the fighting taking place in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various generals leading the Union's Army of the Potomac, none had succeeded in destroying the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capturing Richmond. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan had come closest to success in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of Richmond.

The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the failure of Union forces to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia. The Confederacy was also struggling, with attempted invasions of the North being turned back at Antietam and Gettysburg. However, the Union had made gains in the West, capturing Vicksburg and Chattanooga, which threw open the gateway to Georgia.

In 1864, the Union army was in a stronger position, with more resources and a greater ability to refill its ranks. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given responsibility for all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction, while leaving the execution of operations to Maj. Gen. George G. Meade.

The Union plan was to capture Richmond and Petersburg, with Grant's army attacking from the north and Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler's Army of the James attacking from the southeast. The Army of the James was initially successful, capturing City Point and threatening the Confederate capital. However, they were eventually shut down by a numerically inferior Confederate force.

The Battle of the Wilderness marked the start of the final campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia, with Grant's army clashing with Lee's defenders of Richmond. The battle resulted in heavy losses on both sides, but the armies remained intact. Grant then moved his army to the east of Richmond, hoping to outflank the Confederate defenders.

The Battle of Petersburg began on June 15, 1864, with the Union XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and attacking the Confederate defenses. The Confederates were initially successful in holding back the Union advance, but eventually, the Union army broke through the defenses and captured a significant portion of the city.

The Union army then began to besiege Petersburg, with Grant's army extending its lines around the city and cutting off the Confederate supply lines. The Confederates, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, were forced to defend a long line of fortifications, which stretched from Richmond to Petersburg.

In July 1864, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of the Crater, which was a failed attempt to break through the Confederate lines using a mine. The battle resulted in heavy losses on both sides, but the Confederates were able to hold their positions.

The Union army continued to besiege Petersburg, with Grant's army making repeated attempts to break through the Confederate lines. In August 1864, the Union army captured the Weldon Railroad, which was a significant supply line for the Confederates. The Confederates launched a series of counterattacks, but were ultimately unable to retake the railroad.

In September 1864, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm, which resulted in the Union army extending its lines around the city. The Confederates were forced to defend a longer line of fortifications, which stretched from Richmond to Petersburg.

The Union army continued to besiege Petersburg, with Grant's army making repeated attempts to break through the Confederate lines. In February 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Hatcher's Run, which resulted in the Union army extending its lines around the city.

The Confederates, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, were forced to defend a long line of fortifications, which stretched from Richmond to Petersburg. However, the Union army was ultimately able to break through the Confederate lines, and on April 2, 1865, the city of Petersburg fell to the Union army.

The fall of Petersburg marked the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, with Gen. Robert E. Lee's army surrendering at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The surrender marked the effective end of the Civil War, with all Confederate forces surrendering by early June 1865. The war had resulted in the loss of over 600,000 lives and the emancipation of four million slaves.
