You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. The Romans invaded Britain and established a settlement in Canterbury, which they called Durovernum. After the Romans left, the Anglo-Saxons took over and the city became an important center for trade and commerce. In 597, Augustine arrived in Canterbury and introduced Christianity to the city. The city's cathedral, which was built by the Normans, is one of the most famous landmarks in Canterbury.

The cathedral has a long and complex history, with various additions and renovations made over the centuries. The most significant event in the cathedral's history is the murder of Thomas Becket, who was archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 to 1170. Becket's murder led to a wave of pilgrims visiting the city, and the cathedral became a major pilgrimage site.

The city of Canterbury is still surrounded by its medieval walls, which date back to the 14th century. The walls are punctuated by several gates, including the West Gate, which is the only remaining gate from the medieval period. The city is also home to several other historic buildings, including St. Martin's Church, which is one of the oldest churches in England.

St. Martin's Church is a significant historical site, as it is believed to be the place where Queen Bertha, the wife of King Ethelbert, worshipped before the arrival of Augustine. The church has undergone several renovations over the centuries, but it still retains some of its original Saxon features. The city is also home to the remains of St. Augustine's Abbey, which was founded by Augustine in 597.

The abbey was an important center of learning and culture during the Middle Ages, and it played a significant role in the development of Christianity in England. The abbey was dissolved during the Reformation, and its buildings were used for various purposes, including as a palace and a brewery. In the 19th century, the abbey was restored and it is now home to a missionary college.

In addition to its historic buildings, Canterbury is also known for its picturesque streets and its vibrant cultural scene. The city is home to several museums, galleries, and festivals, which celebrate its rich history and cultural heritage. Visitors to the city can walk along the medieval walls, visit the cathedral and other historic buildings, and enjoy the city's many shops, restaurants, and cafes.

The city's history is also reflected in its many churches, including St. Dunstan's, which is one of the oldest churches in Canterbury. The church is home to the head of Sir Thomas More, which is preserved in a vault. The city is also home to several hospitals, including the Hospital of St. Nicholas, which was founded in the 12th century as a home for lepers.

Overall, Canterbury is a city with a rich and complex history, which is reflected in its many historic buildings, streets, and cultural attractions. The city is a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims, who come to visit the cathedral, the abbey, and other historic sites. The city's history and culture continue to inspire and fascinate people to this day, and it remains one of the most important and interesting cities in England.
