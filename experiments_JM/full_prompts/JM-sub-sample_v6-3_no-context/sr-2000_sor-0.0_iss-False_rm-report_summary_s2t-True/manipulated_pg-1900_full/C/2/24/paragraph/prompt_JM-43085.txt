You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier was a French painter born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and detailed artwork, which often featured military scenes and everyday life. Meissonier's early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, as his father wanted him to become a druggist. However, he eventually gained permission to study art and went on to become a successful painter.

Meissonier's artwork is characterized by its attention to detail and realism. He was known for his ability to capture the essence of his subjects, whether they were people, animals, or objects. His paintings often featured intricate details, such as the folds of clothing or the expressions on people's faces. Meissonier's use of color was also notable, as he preferred a more subdued palette that reflected the reality of the scene he was depicting.

One of Meissonier's most famous works is "1807," which depicts a scene of cavalry passing through a field of grain. The painting is notable for its sense of movement and energy, as well as its attention to detail.

Meissonier's career was marked by numerous successes, including his election to the Academy of Fine Arts in 1861. He also received several awards and honors for his work, including the grand golden medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1855. Despite his success, Meissonier remained humble and dedicated to his craft, continually striving to improve his skills and push the boundaries of his art.

Meissonier's love of detail and realism was not limited to his artwork. He was also a meticulous collector of historical artifacts and costumes, which he used to inform and inspire his paintings. His collection included items such as breeches, hats, helmets, and jewelry, which he would often incorporate into his artwork.

Throughout his career, Meissonier was driven by a passion for accuracy and authenticity. He believed that art should reflect reality, and he spent countless hours researching and studying his subjects to ensure that his paintings were as realistic as possible. This attention to detail and commitment to realism earned him a reputation as one of the greatest painters of his time.

Meissonier's military paintings are also notable for their sense of drama and energy. He often depicted scenes of battle and cavalry charges, which were characterized by their sense of movement and tension. These paintings showcased Meissonier's ability to capture the essence of a moment in time, and his use of color and composition to convey a sense of drama and excitement.

In addition to his paintings, Meissonier was also a skilled etcher and illustrator. He created numerous etchings and illustrations throughout his career, which were often used to accompany literary works or to illustrate historical events. These works demonstrate Meissonier's versatility and range as an artist, and his ability to adapt his skills to different mediums and formats.

Overall, Meissonier's artwork is a testament to his dedication to his craft and his passion for realism and accuracy. His paintings and etchings continue to be celebrated for their attention to detail, their sense of drama and energy, and their ability to capture the essence of a moment in time.
