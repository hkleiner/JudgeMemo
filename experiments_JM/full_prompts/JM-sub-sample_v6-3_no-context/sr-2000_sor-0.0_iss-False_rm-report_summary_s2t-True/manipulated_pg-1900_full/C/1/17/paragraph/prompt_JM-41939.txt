You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a young painter born in 1822 in Bordeaux, France. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a drawing master who struggled to make a living. Rosa's mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician who shared similar tastes and opinions with her husband. The couple married and had several children, including Rosa. Due to financial difficulties, the family moved frequently, and Rosa was mostly homeschooled by her father.

Rosa's early life was marked by a passion for drawing and painting, which was encouraged by her father. She would often draw and paint animals, and her father recognized her talent at a young age. In 1829, the family moved to Paris, where Rosa was exposed to the city's artistic scene. She attended a boys' school and developed boyish manners, which she retained throughout her life.

Rosa's father remarried after her mother's death in 1833, and the family continued to struggle financially. Despite these challenges, Rosa's talent and dedication to art only grew stronger. She began to study anatomy and dissection to improve her understanding of animal physiology. In 1841, she submitted two works to the Salon, which were accepted, marking the beginning of her successful career as an artist.

Rosa's big break came in 1849 with the sale of her painting "Ploughing in the Nivernais" to the French government. She became known for her realistic and detailed depictions of animals, particularly horses and cattle. Her success continued to grow, and she was awarded a medal at the Universal Exposition in 1855.

In the 1860s, Rosa moved to a chateau in By, where she established a menagerie and continued to paint. She became a celebrated artist, both in France and abroad, and was awarded the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1897. Despite her success, Rosa's personal life was marked by tragedy, including the loss of her beloved friend and companion, Nathalie Micas, in 1889.

Rosa continued to paint until her death in 1899, at the age of 77. Her final works were still marked by their characteristic vigor and beauty. She was buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery, and her funeral was attended by many prominent figures from the art world. Rosa Bonheur's legacy as one of the greatest animal painters of all time remains unchallenged, and her work continues to inspire and delight art lovers around the world.

Throughout her life, Rosa was known for her kindness, generosity, and dedication to her art. She was a true pioneer, paving the way for future generations of women artists. Her story is a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and passion, and her art remains a lasting tribute to her memory. Rosa's life was marked by both triumph and tragedy, but her legacy continues to endure, inspiring artists and art lovers to this day.
