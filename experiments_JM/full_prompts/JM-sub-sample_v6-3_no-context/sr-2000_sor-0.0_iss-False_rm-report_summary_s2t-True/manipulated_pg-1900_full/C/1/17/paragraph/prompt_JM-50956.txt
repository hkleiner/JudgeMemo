You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" discusses Russia's significant role in the war. The author, Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, highlights Russia's enormous sacrifices, with over 12 million casualties, including 3 million dead. Russia's losses were more than twice those of France, four to five times those of England, and over 35 times those of America.

The pamphlet argues that Russia's participation in the war was crucial, as it prevented Germany from winning. The German plan, led by Field Marshal Moltke, was to defeat France quickly, but Russia's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia diverted German forces, giving France time to prepare. Russia's efforts also helped to save Italy from an Austrian offensive in 1916.

The pamphlet criticizes General Ludendorf's memoirs for distorting the truth about Russia's role in the war. Ludendorf claimed that Russia was weak and ineffective, but the pamphlet argues that Russia's sacrifices were instrumental in the Allied victory. The Russian Army was unprepared for modern warfare, with only one-tenth of its soldiers armed, but it still managed to divert German forces and prevent them from winning.

The pamphlet also discusses the Battle of Warsaw, where Russia defeated the Germans, and the Brusilov offensive, which netted over 200,000 prisoners. Russia's efforts in 1915, although unsuccessful in terms of territory gained, gave the Allies a year to prepare for the German offensive at Verdun.

The pamphlet concludes that Russia's role in the war was essential, and that without Russia, the Allies would not have been able to defeat Germany. Russia's sacrifices were immense, and its military efforts were crucial in preventing Germany from winning. The pamphlet also notes that Russia's future role in European politics will be significant, and that it is essential for Western statesmen to consider Russia's interests and power in their calculations.

Overall, the pamphlet argues that Russia's participation in the war was vital, and that its sacrifices and military efforts were instrumental in the Allied victory. The pamphlet also highlights the importance of considering Russia's future role in European politics, given its significant military power and population. Russia's immense sacrifices and efforts during the war demonstrate its commitment to the Allied cause, and its future role will be crucial in maintaining the balance of power in Europe.
