You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. The Union Army, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, aimed to capture Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy. Grant's strategy involved a two-pronged attack, with General William T. Sherman leading the southern prong. The Union Army launched a series of battles, including the Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor, but failed to capture Richmond.

In June 1864, Grant turned his attention to Petersburg, ordering the Army of the Potomac to cross the James River and invest the city. The first Union forces to arrive were the XVIII Corps, which launched a fierce attack on the Confederate defenses, known as the Dimmock Line. Although the Union troops made initial gains, they were ultimately repelled, and the Confederates held their ground.

The Union Army continued to besiege Petersburg, with Grant ordering the construction of siege lines and the destruction of Confederate supply lines. In July 1864, Union troops attempted to capture the Weldon Railroad, a crucial supply line for the Confederacy. The Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road was fought, but the Confederates were able to repel the Union attack.

In an attempt to break the stalemate, Union troops dug a mine shaft under the Confederate lines, which was detonated on July 30, 1864, creating a massive crater. However, the subsequent Union attack was poorly coordinated, and the Confederates were able to regroup and repel the attack. The Battle of the Crater was a significant Union defeat, with over 4,000 casualties.

The Union Army continued to extend its siege lines around Petersburg, with Grant ordering the capture of the Weldon Railroad in August 1864. The Confederates launched a series of counterattacks, but were ultimately unable to retake the railroad. In September 1864, Union troops launched a series of attacks, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm, in an attempt to encircle Petersburg.

As the siege continued, conditions for both armies became increasingly difficult, with mud, disease, and hunger prevalent. The Confederates were particularly hard hit, with desertions and casualties mounting. In March 1865, General Lee launched a desperate attack on Fort Stedman, but was repelled with heavy losses.

The final Union assault on Petersburg began on April 1, 1865, with the Battle of Five Forks, which was a decisive Union victory. The Confederates were forced to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond, and the Union Army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War.

The Petersburg campaign was one of the longest and most brutal of the Civil War, with over 70,000 casualties. The Union Army's victory was due in large part to Grant's strategy of relentless attrition, which wore down the Confederate Army. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, and the surrender of General Lee's army marked the effective end of the Civil War.
