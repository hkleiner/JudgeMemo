You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The document "One Common Faith" discusses the role of religion in addressing the spiritual and moral crisis facing humanity. The authors argue that the world's religious leaders must rise above sectarian conceptions and recognize the oneness of religion. They express confidence that the period of history now opening will be receptive to efforts to spread Bahá'u'lláh's message. The materialistic interpretation of reality has failed, and a new understanding of religion's purpose is needed.

The world is experiencing a spiritual awakening, with people seeking a deeper understanding of existence and their place in it. This awakening is driven by the failure of materialism and the increasing recognition of the interconnectedness of the world. The authors argue that the primary agents of spiritual development have been the great religions, but that these religions have been limited by their own dogma and sectarianism.

The concept of progressive revelation is central to the authors' argument, suggesting that each religion has built upon the previous one, revealing a single, unfolding truth. They argue that the differences between religions are not as significant as they seem and that the essential message of religion is immutable. The authors also discuss the role of theology in limiting religious understanding and the need for a more nuanced and open-minded approach to spirituality.

The document also explores the relationship between religion and society, arguing that religion has a critical role to play in shaping moral values and promoting social justice. The authors discuss the importance of unity and the need for a global community that transcends sectarian and national divisions. They argue that the Bahá'í community, with its diverse membership and commitment to unity, is a model for this kind of global community.

Ultimately, the authors suggest that the power to achieve unity and address the world's problems lies in the restoration of religion's influence in human affairs. They argue that the laws and principles revealed by God are the most potent instruments for achieving unity and that the Bahá'í community has a critical role to play in promoting this unity. The document concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the oneness of religion and the need for a new understanding of spirituality that is open, inclusive, and committed to unity and social justice. 

The authors emphasize that the task of the Bahá'í community is to assist all stages of humanity's universal movement towards reunion with God. They argue that the Bahá'í community's growth and development are critical to addressing the world's problems and that the community's commitment to unity and social justice is a model for the world. The document concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the oneness of religion and the need for a new understanding of spirituality that is open, inclusive, and committed to unity and social justice. 

The Bahá'í community is called upon to play a vital role in promoting unity and social justice, and its growth and development are seen as critical to addressing the world's problems. The authors argue that the community's commitment to unity and social justice is a model for the world and that its example can inspire others to work towards a more just and peaceful world. 

Overall, the document "One Common Faith" presents a vision of a world united in its diversity, with religion playing a critical role in promoting unity and social justice. The authors argue that this vision is not only possible but necessary, and that the Bahá'í community has a critical role to play in achieving it.
