You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various generals leading the Union's Army of the Potomac, none had succeeded in destroying the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capturing Richmond. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan came closest to success in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of Richmond.

In 1864, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given command of all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction to military operations. Grant's plan was to capture Richmond and Petersburg, and then march south to join forces with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman. The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast.

The Battle of the Wilderness marked the start of the final campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia. The Union army suffered heavy losses, but Grant continued to push forward, attempting to outflank the Confederate defenders. The Battle of Cold Harbor resulted in significant Union casualties, and Grant eventually decided to turn his attention to Petersburg.

Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub, with several railroads and roads connecting it to Richmond and the rest of the Confederacy. The city's defenses, known as the Dimmock Line, were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile-long chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. The Union army launched a series of attacks on Petersburg, but were initially repulsed.

In June 1864, Grant ordered the Army of the Potomac to cross the James River and invest Petersburg. The XVIII Corps, led by Maj. Gen. W. F. "Baldy" Smith, was the first to arrive on the scene, and they launched a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates were forced to withdraw, but the Union army was unable to break through the defenses.

The Union army continued to extend its siege lines around Petersburg, attempting to cut off the city's supply lines. In July 1864, they launched a series of attacks on the Weldon Railroad, which was a crucial supply line for the Confederacy. The Battle of the Crater, which took place on July 30, 1864, was a Union attempt to break through the Confederate defenses by digging a mine under the enemy lines.

The mine was detonated, creating a large crater, but the Union army was unable to capitalize on the opportunity. The Confederates rallied and launched a counterattack, which forced the Union army to retreat. The Battle of the Crater was a significant Union defeat, with over 4,000 casualties.

In August 1864, the Union army launched another attack on the Weldon Railroad, which was successful in capturing a portion of the railroad. The Confederates attempted to retake the railroad, but were unsuccessful. The Union army continued to extend its siege lines, attempting to cut off Petersburg and Richmond.

In September 1864, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm. The Confederates were forced to extend their lines, which made them more vulnerable to attack. In October 1864, the Union army launched another attack on the Boydton Plank Road, which was repulsed by the Confederates.

The winter of 1864-1865 was marked by a series of small skirmishes and raids, as both armies dug in for the long haul. In February 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Hatcher's Run. The Confederates were forced to extend their lines, which made them even more vulnerable to attack.

In March 1865, Grant launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Fort Stedman. The Confederates were able to repel the attack, but at significant cost. On April 1, 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Five Forks. The Confederates were forced to retreat, and the Union army was able to cut off the last remaining supply line to Petersburg.

On April 2, 1865, the Union army launched a final attack on the Confederate defenses, which resulted in the fall of Petersburg. The Confederates retreated, and the Union army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, Lee's army surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, and the war was officially over by June 1865.
