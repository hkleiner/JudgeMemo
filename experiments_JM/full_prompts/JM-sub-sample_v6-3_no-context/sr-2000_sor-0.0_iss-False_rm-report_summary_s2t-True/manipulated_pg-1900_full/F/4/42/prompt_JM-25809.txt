You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jim Felton, a miner, is struggling to find gold in Sweet Briar Gulch. He receives a letter from his lover, Anne, who refuses to marry him due to his lack of financial stability. Jim is heartbroken and feels like giving up. His friend, Bud, a mail carrier, visits him and offers to help. Bud gives Jim some money and suggests he take a break from his solitary life.

Jim decides to go to the nearby town of Plattsburg, where he meets a young boy named Ches, who is being abused by a man and woman. Jim rescues the boy and decides to take him in. The boy is grateful and promises to do anything for Jim. Jim and Ches return to the gulch, where Jim continues to work on his mining claim.

Ches is fascinated by the wilderness and enjoys exploring. Jim teaches him about the area and its wildlife. They go on a hunting trip, but instead of shooting deer, Jim tries to catch one with his hands. The attempt is unsuccessful, but they have a fun and exciting time.

When they return to the cabin, Jim starts working on his tunnel again. However, the tunnel collapses, and Jim is trapped. Ches tries to rescue him but is unable to do so on his own. He rides a horse to find help and meets a group of miners who come to their aid.

The miners, led by Captain Hanrahan, work together to rescue Jim. They dig a new tunnel and eventually reach Jim, who is injured but alive. The miners are relieved and happy to have saved Jim's life. Ches is grateful to the miners for their help and promises to repay them someday.

As Jim recovers from his injuries, he receives a letter from Anne, who has changed her mind and wants to be with him. She is willing to come to the gulch and live with him, regardless of the difficulties. Jim is overjoyed and feels like his luck has finally changed. The story ends with Jim, Ches, and Bud enjoying each other's company, feeling grateful and happy.
