You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change and progress in England. The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on the country, bringing about rapid economic growth and urbanization. However, this growth was accompanied by social and economic problems, including poverty, inequality, and exploitation of workers. The age was marked by a sense of optimism and hope for the future, but also by a growing awareness of the need for social reform.

The Victorian era saw the rise of great literary figures, including Alfred Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and the Brontë sisters. Tennyson's poetry, in particular, reflected the mood of the age, with its emphasis on beauty, morality, and the search for meaning. The novel became a popular form of literature during this period, with authors like Dickens and Thackeray producing works that are still widely read today.

Despite the many advances of the Victorian era, the age was also marked by social and economic problems. The gap between the rich and the poor grew wider, and the working class faced significant challenges, including poverty, poor working conditions, and limited access to education. The age also saw the rise of socialism and the labor movement, as workers began to organize and demand better treatment.

The Victorian era was also a time of significant scientific and technological progress. The discovery of new scientific principles and the development of new technologies, such as the steam engine and the telegraph, transformed the way people lived and worked. The age saw the rise of great scientists, including Charles Darwin and Michael Faraday, who made significant contributions to our understanding of the natural world.

In terms of politics, the Victorian era was marked by the rise of liberalism and the expansion of democracy. The Reform Act of 1832 extended the right to vote to more people, and the age saw the emergence of great political leaders, including Gladstone and Disraeli. The era also saw the rise of imperialism, as European powers, including Britain, competed for colonies and influence around the world.

Despite the many achievements of the Victorian era, the age was also marked by significant challenges and problems. The era saw the rise of nationalism and the growth of tensions between European powers, which ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I. The age also saw the decline of traditional industries and the growth of new social and economic problems, including poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

In conclusion, the Victorian Age was a complex and multifaceted period in English history, marked by significant progress and achievement, but also by significant challenges and problems. The age saw the rise of great literary and scientific figures, significant social and economic change, and the emergence of new political and ideological movements. Despite its many achievements, the era was also marked by significant flaws and weaknesses, which ultimately contributed to its decline and the emergence of new social and economic problems in the 20th century.

The Victorian era was a time of great change and upheaval, and its legacy continues to shape our world today. The age saw the emergence of new ideas and technologies, which transformed the way people lived and worked. However, the era was also marked by significant social and economic problems, which continue to affect us today. As we look to the future, it is clear that the Victorian Age will remain an important and influential period in English history, and its legacy will continue to shape our world for generations to come.

The age was also marked by a growing awareness of the need for social reform, and the emergence of new social and political movements. The rise of socialism and the labor movement, for example, reflected a growing recognition of the need for greater social and economic equality. The age also saw the emergence of new feminist and suffragist movements, which fought for women's rights and greater social and political equality.

Overall, the Victorian Age was a complex and multifaceted period in English history, marked by significant progress and achievement, but also by significant challenges and problems. The age saw the rise of great literary and scientific figures, significant social and economic change, and the emergence of new political and ideological movements. As we look to the future, it is clear that the Victorian Age will remain an important and influential period in English history, and its legacy will continue to shape our world for generations to come.
