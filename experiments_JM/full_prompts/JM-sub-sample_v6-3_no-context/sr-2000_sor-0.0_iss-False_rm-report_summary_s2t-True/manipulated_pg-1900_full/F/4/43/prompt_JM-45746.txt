You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their journey to becoming a schoolmaster, initially considering it a "fill-in job" but eventually finding passion and purpose in the profession. They share experiences of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who made it a job and the other who made it a profession. The author emphasizes the importance of a pleasing and forceful personality in a teacher's success. 

When applying for positions, candidates should be prepared to discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and superintendents should look for teachers with a good general education and specialization in their subject area. The author also stresses the importance of self-examination and study for teachers to realize their strengths and limitations.

As a superintendent, the author attended county, sectional, state, and national teachers' meetings to stay updated on current school problems and educational leaders. They prepared for their first superintendency by studying the school situation, meeting with the board members, and compiling a report on school attendance and supplies.

The author believes that teachers' meetings should be productive and provide tangible help to teachers. They suggest holding sectional meetings for teachers to discuss specific topics and general meetings for all teachers to present important information. The author also emphasizes the importance of personal talks between the superintendent and teachers to discuss their work and difficulties.

In terms of school activities, the author suggests that student organizations should be carefully supervised and that the number of activities should depend on the size of the school. They quote a report from a Seattle high school principal, highlighting the benefits and challenges of extra-curricular activities.

The author shares an experience of building a relationship with a janitor, who initially was cold and casual but eventually became cooperative and friendly. They emphasize the importance of treating all employees with respect and kindness, just like a successful business manager would.

A series of monthly evening meetings among principals discussed topics that directly affected their work, including how the principal can help the teacher. Teachers suggested that principals can help in professional, administrative, and personal ways, such as providing assistance with exceptional children, interpreting the course of study, and furnishing supplies and equipment.

The author highlights the importance of the school's relationship with the community, noting that the public school has become a significant factor in a child's life. They emphasize the need for vocational guidance and adjustment to proper vocations, citing examples of schools that have implemented successful programs. The author concludes that the schoolmaster of tomorrow must be aware of the changing conditions in social and industrial life and make readjustments in the program of education accordingly. 

Overall, the author's experiences and insights emphasize the importance of passion, purpose, and relationships in the teaching profession, as well as the need for schools to adapt to the changing needs of their students and communities. By sharing their own journey and observations, the author provides valuable lessons for educators and administrators seeking to make a positive impact on their students and schools.
