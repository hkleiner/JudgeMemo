You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Nacogdoches, Texas, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. The city was founded by Antonio Gil Ybarbo in 1779 and was originally a Spanish town. The area was first inhabited by the Tejas Indians, who had a complex society with their own government and traditions. In 1716, the Spanish established the Mission Guadalupe, which was later abandoned and rebuilt several times. The city's location made it a key spot for trade and commerce, and it was an important stop on the El Camino Real, a major road that connected the city to other parts of Texas and Mexico.

In the early 19th century, Nacogdoches was a major hub for the Mexican Revolution, with many prominent figures, including Stephen F. Austin, passing through the city. The city was also home to a number of important events, including the Battle of Nacogdoches, which took place in 1832. The battle was a key moment in the Texas Revolution, and it marked the beginning of the end of Mexican rule in the region.

After the Texas Revolution, Nacogdoches continued to grow and develop, with many new businesses and homes being built. The city became a major center for education, with the establishment of the Nacogdoches University in 1845. The university was an important institution in the city, and it played a key role in the development of the region.

Today, Nacogdoches is a thriving city with a rich history and culture. The city is home to a number of historic sites, including the Old Stone Fort, which was built in 1779 and served as a trading post and a military outpost. The city is also home to the Stephen F. Austin State University, which was established in 1917 and is named after the famous empresario who played a key role in the development of the region.

Nacogdoches has a number of historic homes and buildings, including the Adolphus Sterne Home, which was built in 1830 and is now a museum. The city also has a number of historic churches, including the Old North Church, which was built in 1838 and is still in use today. The city's historic district is filled with beautiful old homes and buildings, and it is a popular destination for tourists and history buffs.

The city's history is also commemorated through a number of monuments and markers, including the Texas Centennial Marker, which was erected in 1936 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Texas' independence. The city is also home to the Oak Grove Cemetery, which is the final resting place of many of the city's early residents, including Thomas J. Rusk, who was a prominent figure in the Texas Revolution.

Overall, Nacogdoches is a city with a rich and varied history, and it continues to be an important part of the state's cultural and economic heritage. The city's historic sites, homes, and buildings are a testament to its enduring legacy, and they continue to attract visitors from all over the world. With its unique blend of Spanish, Mexican, and American influences, Nacogdoches is a city that is truly one-of-a-kind.
