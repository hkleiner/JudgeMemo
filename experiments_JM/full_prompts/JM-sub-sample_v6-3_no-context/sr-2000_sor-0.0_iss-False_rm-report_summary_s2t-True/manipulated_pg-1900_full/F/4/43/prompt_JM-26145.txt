You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reign of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets were letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters revealed the difficulties of the script and language, with scribes using Babylonian mythological texts to improve their fluency.

The tablets also showed that the Egyptian kings, particularly Amenophis III, had a warlike spirit, but this ceased with the accession of Amenophis IV, who introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion. The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was built, and the royal court was moved from Thebes. The officials who accepted the new doctrine were regarded as deserving men, and Ai, a secretary of state, received golden honors.

The tablets also contained letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters revealed the diplomatic relations between Egypt and other kingdoms, with discussions of marriage alliances, gifts, and trade. The letters also showed the struggles of the Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, with complaints of attacks by the Habiri and other tribes.

The tablets provided valuable information about the history of civilization, including the political conditions of the Tell el Amarna period. The Egyptian system of government was criticized for its weakness, and the petty princes were often at odds with each other. The tablets also mentioned the Hittites, who were pressing forward from Asia Minor into Syria, and the kingdom of Mitani, which was nearing its fall.

The letters from the Asiatic vassals, including Aziru, Rib-Addi, and Abdi-kheba, revealed the struggles of these officials to maintain their power and position. The tablets also contained letters from women, including the daughter of Napkhuria, who was married to Burnaburiash. The tablets provided a unique insight into the politics, culture, and society of the ancient Near East during the 14th century BC.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has been significant for the study of ancient history, providing a wealth of information about the diplomatic relations, political conditions, and cultural practices of the time. The tablets have also shed light on the history of the Hebrews, who were already present in the "Promised Land" during this period. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource, offering a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of ancient Near Eastern politics and society.
