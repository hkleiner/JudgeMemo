You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl living in Plymouth with her father, Bill Mason. Her father is a drunkard and has joined a crew of men heading to Boston. Debby is left behind and bound out to Mrs. Lane, a strict and religious woman. Debby's father promises to become a better man and fight in the war, but Debby is skeptical. She runs after him, begging to go with him, but he is taken away by the crowd.

Debby is miserable living with Mrs. Lane, who is cruel and strict. She longs for her father and the freedom to be herself. One day, she decides to take matters into her own hands and escapes from Mrs. Lane's house, dressing up as a boy to join the army. She takes on the name Robert Shirtliffe and becomes a drummer boy.

As Robert, she meets Jack Martin, a friend from her past, who is also fighting in the war. Robert tells Jack about her desire to find her father and Jack agrees to help her. They discuss the war and the bravery of the American soldiers. Robert learns about the Battle of Lexington and the Battle of Bunker Hill, and she becomes determined to find her father and fight for the American cause.

Robert's journey takes her to the American camp, where she meets General Washington and becomes a part of his army. She participates in the Battle of Trenton and plays a crucial role in the American victory. However, she is wounded and left behind, where she meets a British soldier named Morley, who looks eerily like her.

Morley is dying, and Robert promises to deliver a message to his mother in London. Morley tells Robert that he was looking for a girl named Debby Mason, and Robert realizes that Morley was searching for her. Robert is filled with regret and grief, knowing that she killed Morley in self-defense.

Robert is found by American soldiers and taken to a field hospital, where she is nursed back to health by Doctor Bell. Doctor Bell discovers Robert's true identity as Debby Mason and helps her to write a letter to General Washington, explaining her situation. Washington is understanding and grants Debby an honorable discharge from the army.

Debby returns to Doctor Bell's home, where she is welcomed by his mother. She decides to travel to England to meet Morley's mother and tell her about her son's death. In England, Debby meets her own relatives and learns about her family's past. She also meets Morley's mother, who is grieving for her son.

Debby tells Morley's mother about his bravery and death, and the two women form a bond. Debby's relatives offer her a home, but she decides to return to America, where she feels a sense of belonging. Doctor Bell proposes to Debby, and she accepts, knowing that she has found a loving and supportive partner.

The story ends with Debby and Doctor Bell getting married and starting a new life together. Debby finally finds happiness and a sense of belonging, after a long and difficult journey. She is able to put her past behind her and look forward to a bright future with the man she loves.
