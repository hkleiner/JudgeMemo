You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author, an American woman, traveled to France during World War I to write about the women of France in wartime. She found that France was divided into two sections: one where life was relatively normal, and the other, the war zone, where military control was strict. To enter the war zone, she needed a special permit, which she obtained after weeks of effort and with the help of influential connections.

The author visited several towns in the war zone, including Châlons, Bar-le-Duc, and Nancy, where she saw the devastating effects of war. She witnessed destroyed buildings, trenches, and military equipment, and met with soldiers, officers, and civilians who were affected by the war. She also visited military hospitals, where she saw the wounded and learned about the work of the Red Cross and other organizations that provided aid to the soldiers.

The author was struck by the bravery and resilience of the French people, particularly the women, who were playing a crucial role in the war effort. She also noted the significant contribution of American women, who were working with the Red Cross and other organizations to provide aid to the soldiers and civilians.

The author's travels took her to the front lines, where she saw the destruction caused by the war and met with soldiers who were fighting on the front lines. She was impressed by the bravery and camaraderie of the soldiers, who were risking their lives to defend their country.

Despite the dangers and difficulties of traveling in the war zone, the author was determined to see the reality of the war for herself. She was accompanied by a American officer, Major C, and a French driver, who helped her navigate the war zone and introduced her to the people and places she encountered.

The author's experiences in the war zone had a profound impact on her, and she was deeply moved by the suffering and bravery of the people she met. She realized that the war was not just a distant event, but a reality that was affecting people's lives in profound ways.

The author also learned about the work of the organization "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", which was providing aid to wounded soldiers. She met with the president of the organization, Madame d'Andigné, and learned about the importance of providing delicacies to the wounded soldiers, who were often unable to eat the standard military rations.

The author's article ends with an appeal to her readers to support the work of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" and to contribute to the organization's efforts to provide aid to the wounded soldiers. She emphasizes the importance of this work and the impact it can have on the lives of the soldiers and their families.

Overall, the author's article provides a vivid and moving account of her experiences in the war zone and highlights the bravery and resilience of the French people, as well as the importance of the work of organizations like "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" in providing aid to those affected by the war.
