You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among great artists. A significant period elapsed between the death of Adrian van Ostade and Millet's birth, with only Chardin grasping the profundity of peasant life during that time. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a great master, was initially seen as an eccentric painter but is now recognized for his philosophical and artistic contributions. Brueghel's influence was felt in the Low Countries, leading to a school of peasant painting that included Adrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by a profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday peasant life, tinged with melancholy fervor.

Millet's temperament is distinct from that of the 17th-century Dutch masters, reflecting the subdued temper of the 19th century. The French peasant, having benefited from the Revolution, was quieter and more subdued than their Dutch counterparts. Millet's work is marked by incisive truth and sincerity, earning him a place as a direct descendant of Brueghel. The absence of brutality in Millet's work is due to his gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters, such as Andrea Mantegna.

Millet's noblest inspirations were conceived under Mantegna's influence, and his compositions often parallel those of the Italian master. Millet's development as an artist is attributed to the simplicity of his life and his high ideals. He led a life of struggle, grasping the sorrows and troubles of the simple folk around him. His work, such as "The Angelus," is not sentimental but rather a truthful portrayal of peasant life. The painting depicts two figures in a field, symbolizing the touching aspects of French peasant life, with the angelus bell marking the end of the day.

Millet's art is characterized by subtleties of atmosphere and line, which can only be appreciated by understanding the country he painted. His manner of handling the brush is restrained, and he rarely bursts into pyrotechnics. When he does, as in "The Sawyers," he achieves astonishing power. However, when he throws off his philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist, as seen in "La Baigneuse." Millet can be described as more a philosopher than a painter, with his drawings and etchings revealing a mind that has grappled with life's great problems.

Millet's interest was divided between the peasant at work and his family life. He was particularly impressed by the loneliness of the peasant's labor, as depicted in "The Sheep Pen." The painting shows a shepherd alone in a vast plain, accompanied only by his dog, highlighting the solitude of rural life. Millet's work is a testament to his understanding of the human condition, and his art continues to be appreciated for its sincerity and profundity. Overall, Millet's unique perspective and artistic style have cemented his place as a prominent figure in the world of art.
