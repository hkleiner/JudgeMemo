You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story revolves around Kuei Ping, a Chinese woman, and her journey towards self-discovery and freedom. The narrator learns about Kuei Ping's life from her and shares her story. Kuei Ping was born into a traditional Chinese family and was betrothed to a man named Chia Fuh Tang at a young age. She was educated at a mission school, where she was influenced by Western ideas and values.

Kuei Ping's marriage to Fuh Tang was arranged, and she was expected to follow traditional Chinese customs. However, she and Fuh Tang shared a desire for freedom and personal choice, which led them to leave their family's compound and start a new life in Peking. Fuh Tang worked as a clerk, and Kuei Ping managed the household and took care of their son, Bo Te.

As time passed, Fuh Tang became ill and struggled with opium addiction, which put a strain on their relationship. Kuei Ping, meanwhile, found solace in her Christian faith and began to see her role in the family and society in a new light. She realized that her duty was not only to her family but also to serve others and make a positive impact on her community.

Kuei Ping's husband, Fuh Tang, eventually passed away, leaving her to care for their two children alone. Despite the challenges she faced, Kuei Ping remained committed to her faith and her desire to make a difference. She began teaching foreigners Chinese and eventually started a school in her village, where she taught children about Christianity and Western values.

Years later, Kuei Ping's son, Kwan Wa, got married and moved to Mukden, and she was finally able to realize her dream of building a church in her village. The church became a symbol of hope and freedom for the community, and Kuei Ping's story served as an inspiration to those around her. The narrator becomes Kuei Ping's pupil and learns about her life, values, and faith, and is deeply moved by her story.

Kuei Ping's journey is one of self-discovery, faith, and perseverance. She faces many challenges and setbacks, but ultimately finds a sense of purpose and fulfillment in her life. Her story highlights the importance of education, faith, and personal freedom, and serves as a testament to the power of the human spirit. Through her experiences, Kuei Ping comes to understand the value of patience, tenderness, and understanding, and learns to appreciate the beauty of traditional Chinese culture while also embracing new ideas and values.

The narrator is deeply touched by Kuei Ping's story and is inspired by her courage and determination. The story of Kuei Ping's life serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, it is possible to find hope, freedom, and fulfillment.
