You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier was a French painter born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and detailed artwork, which often featured military scenes and everyday life. Meissonier's early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, as his father wanted him to become a druggist. However, he eventually gained permission to study art and went on to become a successful painter.

Meissonier's artistic style was characterized by his attention to detail and his commitment to realism. He was known for his small-scale paintings, which were often criticized for being too tiny. However, Meissonier believed that the size of a painting was not important, as long as it was able to convey the desired message.

Meissonier's breakthrough came with his illustrations for "The Indian Cabin," which showcased his ability to create detailed and realistic scenes. He went on to illustrate other books and eventually turned to painting, where he gained widespread recognition. His paintings often featured scenes from everyday life, such as people reading, smoking, and playing games.

Meissonier was also known for his military paintings, which showcased his attention to detail and his ability to capture the essence of a scene. He was particularly fond of painting horses and owned several himself. He believed that horses were "the stupidest of all intelligent animals" but also found them beautiful and fascinating.

Throughout his career, Meissonier was committed to accuracy and realism. He spent hours researching and preparing for his paintings, often going to great lengths to ensure that every detail was correct. He even went so far as to purchase old clothes and accessories to use as models for his paintings.

Meissonier's dedication to his craft earned him numerous awards and recognition. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour at the age of 30 and later became a member of the Academy of Fine Arts. He also served as a colonel in the National Guard during the Franco-Prussian War.

Despite his success, Meissonier was not without his critics. Some accused him of lacking color and charm in his paintings. However, Meissonier believed that his attention to detail and commitment to realism made up for any perceived shortcomings.

In the end, Meissonier's legacy is one of dedication and perseverance. He spent his entire career striving for accuracy and realism, and his paintings continue to be admired and studied by art lovers around the world. His commitment to his craft is a testament to the power of hard work and attention to detail, and his paintings remain a lasting tribute to his artistic vision. Meissonier's story is a reminder that success is not just about talent, but also about dedication and hard work. He will always be remembered as one of the greatest painters of his time.
