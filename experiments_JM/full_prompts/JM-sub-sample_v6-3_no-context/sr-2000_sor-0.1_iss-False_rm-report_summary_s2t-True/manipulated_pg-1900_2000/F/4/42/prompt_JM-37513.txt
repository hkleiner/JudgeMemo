You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author recounts their introduction to Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science, which began with reading Tyndall's Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination. This sparked their enthusiasm for the conquest of nature by physical science and the theory of evolution. The author was particularly drawn to Spencer's essay "Progress: its Law and Cause," which presented a universal law of evolution that applied to all aspects of existence. 

Spencer's law stated that progress is the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous, and that this process occurs through successive differentiations. The author found this idea captivating, as it seemed to explain the complexity and diversity of the universe. They were also impressed by Spencer's ability to apply this law to various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics.

The author notes that Spencer's philosophy was not without its limitations, particularly in its emphasis on biological relationships. However, they argue that Spencer's contributions to these fields were significant and original. The author also acknowledges that Spencer's philosophy was not limited to biology, but rather was a comprehensive system that aimed to explain all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force.

Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy, which included his works on biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, was a major contribution to the field of philosophy. The author quotes Spencer's statement that "every active force produces more than one change" and notes that this idea is central to his philosophy. They also discuss Spencer's concept of the "unknowable," which refers to the ultimate mystery that lies beyond human understanding.

The author concludes that Spencer's philosophy, while not perfect, was a significant contribution to the field of philosophy. They note that Spencer's emphasis on the universality of law and the importance of understanding the natural world was a major advance in scientific thought. The author also quotes Spencer's statement that "we can think of Matter only in terms of Mind" and "we can think of Mind only in terms of Matter," which highlights the interconnectedness of these concepts.

Overall, the author presents a nuanced view of Spencer's philosophy, acknowledging both its strengths and limitations. They argue that Spencer's ideas, while not universally accepted, were an important part of the development of modern scientific thought. The author's discussion of Spencer's philosophy provides a detailed and thoughtful analysis of his ideas and their significance.

The author's introduction to Spencer's philosophy had a profound impact on their own thinking, and they continued to read and admire his works over the years. They note that Spencer's philosophy was not static, but rather evolved over time as he refined and expanded his ideas. The author also acknowledges that Spencer's philosophy was not without its critics, but argues that his contributions to the field of philosophy were significant and lasting.

In conclusion, the author's summary of Spencer's philosophy provides a detailed and thoughtful analysis of his ideas and their significance. They argue that Spencer's emphasis on the universality of law and the importance of understanding the natural world was a major advance in scientific thought, and that his philosophy continues to be relevant today. The author's discussion of Spencer's philosophy is a testament to the enduring importance of his ideas and their continued relevance in modern scientific thought.
