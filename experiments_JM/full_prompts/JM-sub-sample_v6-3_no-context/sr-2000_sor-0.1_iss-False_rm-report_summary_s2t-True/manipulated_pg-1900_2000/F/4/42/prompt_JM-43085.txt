You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier was a French painter born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and realistic artwork, often depicting military scenes. Meissonier's early life was marked by a strong desire to draw and paint, despite his father's initial disapproval. His mother, who died when he was young, had a talent for painting on porcelain and making miniatures, which may have inspired his artistic vocation.

Meissonier's father, a dealer in colonial products and chemicals, wanted him to pursue a more practical career. However, Meissonier's talent and persistence eventually led him to study art under various masters, including Julien Petier and Léon Cogniet. He worked hard to develop his skills, often using soldiers and horses as models to practice his craft.

Meissonier's breakthrough came when he met the art publisher Curmer, who initially rejected his work but later gave him a chance. Meissonier's big break came when he was commissioned to create illustrations for a magazine, which helped establish him as a talented young artist. He exhibited his work for the first time at the age of 16, but it wasn't until later that he gained recognition from the public and critics.

Meissonier's approach to art was characterized by his devotion to realism and attention to detail. He believed in studying nature and capturing its essence in his work. This approach is evident in his anecdote about directing a squadron of cuirassiers to ride through a field of grain, which he did to study the effects of the horses' movement on the crops.

Meissonier's career was marked by a series of successes, including his ability to capture the essence of military life and scenes. He was known for his accuracy and attention to detail, which earned him a reputation as a master painter. Despite his success, Meissonier remained humble and dedicated to his craft, always striving to improve and perfect his art.

The French art scene during Meissonier's time was dominated by the classic tradition, with artists like David and Ingres leading the way. However, Meissonier's unique approach and style set him apart from his contemporaries. He was not a revolutionary like Delacroix, but rather a master of his craft who worked tirelessly to perfect his art.

Meissonier's early years were marked by struggle and hardship, but he persevered and eventually achieved success. He shared his poverty with friends like Daumier and Daubigny, who would later become famous artists in their own right. Meissonier's story is a testament to the power of dedication and hard work in achieving one's goals.

Throughout his career, Meissonier remained committed to his artistic vision, which was characterized by a devotion to realism and attention to detail. He continued to work tirelessly, always striving to improve and perfect his craft. Meissonier's legacy is a testament to the importance of perseverance and dedication in achieving success as an artist.
