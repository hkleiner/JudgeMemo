You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author wants to discuss the bookman, rather than his books, and define what a bookman is. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature. Having many books does not necessarily make someone a bookman, as they may be a collector or a seller. A true bookman is born, not made, and has a natural affinity for books.

The author recounts a story about a man who invited him to dinner and showed off his expensive bookcase, but it was clear that he was not a bookman. The books were locked behind glass doors, and the owner seemed more interested in showing off his wealth than in discussing the books themselves. A bookman, on the other hand, wants to be able to access his books easily and handle them freely.

The author also tells the story of a colonial squatter who asked a friend to send him some books, and the friend spent a month selecting the best of English literature. However, the squatter's response was disappointing, as he simply asked if any new books had been written by Shakespeare or Milton. Despite this, the author sees this as a sign that the squatter has a natural instinct for good literature, as he was able to identify two of the greatest classics of the English language.

The author argues that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between good and bad literature, and who has a deep appreciation for the classics. They may enjoy lighter reading, such as detective stories, but they are also able to recognize and appreciate great literature. The author cites the example of Mark Rutherford, a writer who is not widely known but is deeply appreciated by those who have read him.

The author also discusses the role of the critic in distinguishing between books that are worth reading and those that are not. They quote the French critic Sainte-Beuve, who says that a great book is one that enriches the human mind and speaks to all people in a style that is both new and timeless. The author argues that such books are classics, and that they have a wisdom and beauty that transcends time and age.

Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who is open to all kinds of literature, and who has a deep respect for the classics. They do not require a particular subject or style, but rather a deep appreciation for the art of writing itself. The author concludes by saying that a bookman is someone who is always seeking to learn and appreciate more, and who has a lifelong love affair with books. 

A bookman's library is a reflection of their personality and tastes, and it is not just a collection of books, but a curated selection of works that have meaning and significance. The author notes that a bookman may have a wide range of interests and tastes, but they are always drawn to books that have a certain quality and depth. 

In terms of specific books, the author mentions several classics, including the works of Shakespeare, Milton, and Bunyan. They also mention the importance of having a complete set of certain authors, such as Milton, and of having rare and beautiful editions of certain books. 

Overall, the author's definition of a bookman is someone who is deeply passionate about literature, and who has a lifelong commitment to reading, learning, and appreciating great books.
