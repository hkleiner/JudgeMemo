You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is working on the planet Irwadi. He is the only Earthman in the Interstellar Transfer Service on Irwadi. Ramsey is approached by a Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, who informs him that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively taking control of all hyper-space ships on the planet. This means that Ramsey and other non-Irwadian pilots are no longer allowed to operate their ships.

Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot's license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. The Irwadians are notorious for their harsh treatment of outworlders, and Ramsey knows that he will not receive any charity from them. He visits his friend Stu Englander, a fellow pilot who is struggling to make ends meet due to a bronchial condition.

Ramsey lends Englander some money to help support his family, and then heads to a local gambling hall to try his luck. However, he ends up losing most of his money and is left with only a few credits. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian approaches him, accusing him of "snooping" and telling him to leave. The Irwadian is hostile and aggressive, and Ramsey realizes that the planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a lot of tension between the Irwadians and outworlders.

The situation is ominous, and Ramsey knows that he needs to be careful. He decides to leave the gambling hall and heads out into the cold night air. As he walks, he thinks about his situation and wonders what the future holds. He is a fugitive from Earth and has limited options for making a living on Irwadi. The planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a difficult situation for outworlders like Ramsey, and he will have to find a way to survive until he can leave the planet.

The Irwadians are determined to assert their control over the planet and its resources, and they see the outworlders as a threat to their way of life. The tension between the two groups is palpable, and Ramsey knows that he will have to be careful to avoid any trouble. He thinks about his past and how he ended up on Irwadi, and he wonders what the future holds for him and the other outworlders on the planet.

As he walks, Ramsey notices a beautiful Earthgirl who seems to be in a hurry. She is rushing through the cold wind, and Ramsey wonders what she is doing out so late. He continues on his way, lost in thought, and tries to make sense of the situation on Irwadi. The planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a lot of uncertainty, and Ramsey knows that he will have to be resourceful if he is going to survive.

The Irwadians are a proud and stubborn people, and they will stop at nothing to assert their control over the planet. Ramsey knows that he will have to be careful to avoid any conflict with them, and he wonders what the future holds for the outworlders on Irwadi. The situation is complex and uncertain, and Ramsey can only hope that he will be able to find a way to survive and eventually leave the planet.
