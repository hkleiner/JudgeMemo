You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author recounts their introduction to Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science, which began with reading Tyndall's Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination in 1870. This sparked their enthusiasm for the conquest of nature by physical science and the theory of evolution. The author was particularly drawn to Spencer's essay "Progress: its Law and Cause," which presented a universal law of evolution: the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous. This law applies to all aspects of existence, from the development of the Earth to the development of society and human mind.

The author was impressed by Spencer's ability to provide a brief formula to label the essence of the universe, and his concept of differentiation as the cardinal law of evolution. Spencer's philosophy emphasizes the universality of law and causation, and his Synthetic Philosophy expands on these ideas with astonishing detail. The author notes that Spencer's thought has been completely assimilated into modern science, and his contributions to biology, psychology, and sociology are still recognized today.

Spencer's philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on the paramount importance of biological relationships, which sometimes led him to overlook other relationships. However, his work on social and political developments, as well as his concept of the " Synthetic Philosophy," has had a lasting impact. The author acknowledges that Spencer's philosophy is not limited to the organic and superorganic, but rather encompasses the entire mechanical drama of evolution.

Spencer's fundamental articles of faith, as outlined in his Preface to Howard Collins's Epitome of the Synthetic Philosophy, deal with ubiquitous causes, the instability of the homogeneous, and the persistence of force. His interpretation is all-inclusive, and he seeks to interpret all phenomena in terms of Matter, Motion, and Force. The author concludes that Spencer's philosophy, while not without its limitations, has made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe and the human experience.

The author also notes that Spencer's philosophy is not just about biology, but about the universal principles that govern all of existence. He emphasizes the importance of looking below the surface and considering the underlying mechanical drama of evolution. Spencer's work on mental evolution and the concomitant evolution of mind is also highlighted, and the author acknowledges the difficulty of interpreting mental phenomena in terms of the redistribution of matter and motion.

Ultimately, the author suggests that Spencer's philosophy is an attempt to provide a unified and comprehensive explanation of all phenomena, and that his ideas continue to be relevant and influential today. The author concludes by quoting Spencer's statement that "We can think of Matter only in terms of Mind. We can think of Mind only in terms of Matter," highlighting the interconnectedness of all things and the limitations of human understanding.
