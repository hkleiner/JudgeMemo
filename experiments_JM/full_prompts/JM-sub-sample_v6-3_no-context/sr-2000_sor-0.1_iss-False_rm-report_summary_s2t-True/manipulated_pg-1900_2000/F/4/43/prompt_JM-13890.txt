You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 1538, a writ of summons was sent to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before King Henry VIII. The shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr was destroyed, and his name and memory were erased from records. However, this did not mark the end of pilgrimages to Canterbury. In the 20th century, a new enthusiasm for the site of the shrine emerged, and many people began to visit the city.

The traditional approach to Canterbury is by the old Pilgrims' Way, which passes through the beautiful hills of Surrey and Kent. However, many modern pilgrims take the train, which rushes them into the city without allowing them to appreciate its gradual unfolding. The city's history dates back to the Roman era, when it was known as Durovernum. The Romans built roads, houses, and public buildings, and the city became an important center.

After the Romans left Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded, and the city was abandoned. It was later rebuilt, and the new settlers called it Cantwarabyrig, which means the city of the men of Kent. In 561, Ethelbert began to reign, and Canterbury became the most important place in Kent. The city was completely heathen until 597, when Augustine landed on the island of Ebbsfleet and began to preach Christianity.

Ethelbert allowed Augustine to preach and provided him with quarters in Canterbury. The old church of St. Martin outside the city was where Queen Bertha had worshipped with her chaplain, and it was here that Augustine began to instruct the people. The influence of the queen and her chaplain had prepared the ground for Augustine's mission, and many people were converted to Christianity.

In a few years, the Christianizing of England had made significant progress, and Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England. The city has held this position for over 1,300 years, despite the changes that have taken place in the country. The church of St. Martin's is the first church mentioned in history associated with Christian worship, and it occupies a unique position.

The fabric of the little building does not conclusively prove that it is the actual church of the Roman period, but some antiquaries believe that it may be a Christian church built during the Roman occupation. The problem of the church's origins is still unsolved, and further discoveries may be needed to determine its true history. Nevertheless, Canterbury remains a city steeped in history and tradition, and its association with the Christian Church continues to be an important part of its identity.

The city's cathedral is a prominent landmark, and its towers can be seen from a distance. The old city wall and the ancient buildings are still standing, and they provide a glimpse into the city's rich past. The Pilgrims' Way, which passes through the city, is a reminder of the many people who have visited Canterbury over the centuries. Today, the city is still a popular destination for pilgrims and tourists, who come to appreciate its history, architecture, and natural beauty.

In conclusion, Canterbury is a city with a long and complex history, and its association with the Christian Church is an important part of its identity. The city's rich past is still visible in its architecture, and its natural beauty continues to attract visitors from all over the world. Whether approached by the old Pilgrims' Way or by train, Canterbury is a city that has something to offer everyone, and its history and tradition continue to be an important part of its appeal.
