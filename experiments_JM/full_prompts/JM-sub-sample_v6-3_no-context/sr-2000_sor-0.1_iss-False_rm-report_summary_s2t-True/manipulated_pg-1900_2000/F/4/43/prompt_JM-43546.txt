You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the little Scotch cousins to their American counterparts. The author notes that despite differences, the Scotch and Americans share a common bond, particularly in their love for Scottish legends and stories. The preface sets the stage for a warm welcome to the little Scotch cousins whenever they visit America.

The story then shifts to the finding of "Rob Roy," a little puppy discovered by Donald in a lane leading to the widow Calden's house. Donald is excited to show his friend Sandy the puppy, which he found wrapped in his muffler. The puppy is a fine collie breed, and Donald hopes to keep it as his own.

Donald's father, Doctor Gordon, is called upon to examine the puppy and advises that they must try to find its owner. The family decides to advertise the puppy in the paper and give notice at the police station. Meanwhile, the puppy is given a warm welcome, and Mrs. Gordon feeds it milk, which it eagerly laps up.

As the family enjoys their afternoon tea, they discuss the puppy and Donald's hopes of training it to be a sheep-dog. Doctor Gordon cautions that it won't be easy, but Donald is undeterred. The conversation turns to Uncle Alan, who has invited the family to visit his home, Skylemore, in the Highlands.

Uncle Alan is a wealthy man who made his fortune in America and returned to Scotland to enjoy it. He has a beautiful estate with a big park, woodland, and a loch, where one can fish and shoot game. Donald is fascinated by his uncle's stories of adventure in America and looks forward to visiting him.

The family is also expecting a visit from their cousins, Janet and Marjorie Lindsay, who will arrive the following week. The boys are excited to plan activities and outings with their cousins. As the days pass, no one comes to claim the puppy, and it becomes a part of the Gordon family.

Finally, the family decides to name the puppy "Rob Roy," after the hero of Sir Walter Scott's story. The name is eventually shortened to Rob, and the puppy becomes a beloved member of the family. Donald is thrilled to have a new companion and looks forward to many adventures with Rob by his side. The story concludes with Donald eagerly awaiting his visit to Uncle Alan's home, where he hopes to have many exciting experiences with his cousins and Rob.
