You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among great artists. A significant period elapsed between the death of Adrian van Ostade and Millet's birth, with only Chardin grasping the profundity of peasant life during that time. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a great master, was initially seen as an eccentric painter but is now recognized for his influence on peasant painting. Brueghel's peasants, although grotesque, possess fidelity and vigor, making him the fountain-head of peasant painting.

Millet's work is characterized by a profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday peasant life, tinged with melancholy fervor. His temperament is distinct from that of 17th-century Dutch painters, such as Adrian Brouwer and Jan Steen, who depicted a more boisterous and reckless joy. Millet's peasants, on the other hand, are quieter and more subdued, reflecting the changes in European society over the centuries.

The spread of education and the French Revolution's impact on land distribution contributed to the sobering of habits among the French peasantry. Millet's rendering of peasant life is marked by incisive truth and absorbing sincerity, making him a direct descendant of Brueghel. Millet's inspirations were influenced by Andrea Mantegna, and his compositions often run parallel to those of the Italian master.

Millet's life was one of struggle, and he grasped the sorrows and troubles of the simple folk around him. He saw that work made life liveable for them, and his art conveys this message. Some critics have accused Millet of sentimentality, particularly in his popular work, "The Angelus." However, this criticism is unfounded, as the painting captures the essence of French peasant life and the importance of religion in their daily struggles.

Millet's technique is characterized by subtleties of line and tone, which can only be fully appreciated by understanding the country he painted. His manner of handling the brush is restrained, and he avoids virtuosity, instead focusing on conveying the point he wishes to illustrate. When Millet departs from his philosophic mood, his art suffers, as seen in his painting "La Baigneuse," which lacks the intensity and emotion of his other works.

Millet can be described as more a philosopher than a painter, as his art grapples with the great problems of life. His love for the open country and the solitary peasant is evident in his work, and he finds beauty in the simplest incidents of everyday life. Millet's paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen," convey the loneliness of the peasant's labor and the importance of their daily struggles. Overall, Millet's art is a testament to his profound understanding of peasant life and his ability to convey the human experience through his work.
