You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author wants to discuss the bookman, rather than his books, and define what it means to be a bookman. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature. Having many books does not necessarily make someone a bookman, as they may be a collector or a seller. A true bookman is born, not made, and has a natural affinity for books and literature.

The author recounts a story about visiting a wealthy man's library, where he was shown a large, ornate bookcase with glass doors. However, the author was disappointed to find that the books were locked away, suggesting that the owner was more interested in displaying his wealth than in reading and appreciating the books. A bookman, on the other hand, wants to have access to his books at all times and to be able to read and enjoy them.

The author also tells the story of a colonial squatter who asked a friend to send him a collection of books. The friend spent a month selecting the best books, but the squatter's response was disappointing, as he simply asked if any new books had been written by Shakespeare or Milton. However, the author sees this as a sign that the squatter had a natural instinct for literature, as he had fixed on two of the greatest classics of the English language.

The author argues that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between good and bad literature, and who has a deep appreciation for the classics. They may enjoy lighter reading, such as detective stories, but they also have a love for more serious literature. The author cites the example of Mark Rutherford, a writer who is not widely known, but who has a small but dedicated following.

The author believes that the role of the critic is to distinguish between books that are worth reading and those that are not. They should encourage honest work, but also be able to identify books that have a timeless quality and will be remembered for generations to come. The author quotes the French critic Sainte-Beuve, who says that a classic book is one that has enriched the human mind and added to its treasures.

According to the author, a bookman is someone who is catholic in their tastes and has a broad appreciation for literature. They do not require an apology to enjoy a book, regardless of its subject matter. The author cites the example of the Pilgrim's Progress, which is a classic of English literature, despite being a product of Puritanism. A bookman would also appreciate other classics, such as the works of Milton and A'Kempis.

Ultimately, the author believes that a bookman is someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature, and who is able to distinguish between good and bad books. They are not just collectors or sellers, but readers and lovers of books. The author concludes by saying that a bookman would want to have a complete collection of the classics, including the works of Milton and other great authors.
