You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The introduction to Will Bradley's book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts. Bradley's work brought a fresh and vibrant style to the field, which was previously stagnant. He is credited with introducing American colonial typography and creating a unique, non-archaic, and exuberant design style. Bradley's career spanned several decades, and he worked on various projects, including magazines, newspapers, and advertising.

Bradley's early life is also discussed, starting from his childhood in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1875. He was a curious and artistic child, often drawing on the blackboard in school. His father, who was a cartoonist, encouraged his creativity and gave him a printing press. Bradley's family moved to Swampscott, where he spent most of his time at home with his father, who was ill.

After his father's death, Bradley's mother took him to Boston, where they visited relatives and shopped. They eventually moved to Northern Michigan, where Bradley's uncle worked as a paymaster at an iron mine. Bradley attended school in Ishpeming, where he met a girl with cute pigtails and promised to become an artist one day.

Bradley's interest in printing grew, and he began working at the Iron Agitator newspaper at the age of 12. He learned to feed the press, set jobs, and make up the paper. His wages increased over time, and he became responsible for all presswork. Bradley worked hard, often in challenging conditions, and eventually became the foreman at the age of 15.

The text also describes Bradley's experiences with traveling fakers who would come to town and scam local merchants. One such incident involved a faker selling soap with a fake $5 bill. Bradley's editor, Mr. Newett, was aware of these scams and warned the merchants to be cautious. Overall, the introduction to Will Bradley's book provides a glimpse into his life, career, and contributions to American graphic arts. Bradley's story is one of hard work, determination, and creativity, which ultimately led to his success as a pioneering figure in the field. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists and designers.
