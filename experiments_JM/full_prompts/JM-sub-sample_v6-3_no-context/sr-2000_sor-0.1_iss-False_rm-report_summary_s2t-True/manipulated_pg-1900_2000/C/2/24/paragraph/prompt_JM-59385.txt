    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the author reflecting on the concept of World Fellowship, which they believe is a natural law that unites the hearts of women worldwide. The author dedicates the story to the women of America, sharing the life of their Chinese friend and teacher. The story takes place on the Street of Precious Pearls, a side street in a Chinese town where women buy their dowry jewels. 

Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits the street with her grandmother, mother, and a distant relative. They arrive at a shop with rich filigree carvings and double entrance doors, where they are greeted by the owner, Wong Lui, and his attendants. The women are shown various jewels, but Madame Yen and her daughter prefer pearls. 

Wong Lui brings out exquisite gems, each wrapped separately, and the women carefully select the most beautiful ones. Kuei Ping is particularly fond of the pearls and is allowed to hold them in her hand. As she touches the jewels, she feels a sense of connection to them. 

The bargaining process begins, with Madame Yen and Wong Lui engaging in a game of chess-like negotiations. Kuei Ping is fascinated by the process and watches as the two parties carefully measure each other's power to yield from the quoted price. 

As the bargaining continues, Kuei Ping's mind wanders back to her time at the little mission school, where she was sent to study. She remembers her graduation day, when she stood first in her class and received a small reward. She also recalls her conversation with Miss Porter, the principal, who spoke to her about the opportunities available to women in the United States. 

Kuei Ping had been inspired by Miss Porter's words and had considered pursuing a life of freedom and service. However, she knew that her family had already planned her marriage and that she was expected to fulfill her duties. The conflict between her desire for freedom and her loyalty to her family is a difficult one for Kuei Ping to resolve. 

As the bargaining comes to a close, Madame Yen reaches for the pearls that Kuei Ping has been holding. The deal is finalized, and the women prepare to leave the shop. They are bowed out by Wong Lui and his attendants, who thank them for their visit. 

Outside, the chair-bearers wait patiently to take the women back home. The story ends with Kuei Ping reflecting on the pearls and the memories that they evoke. The pearls represent a connection to her family and her heritage, but they also symbolize the limitations and expectations that come with her position in society. 

The story highlights the challenges faced by women in traditional Chinese society, where they are expected to fulfill certain roles and duties. Kuei Ping's desire for freedom and independence is inspired by her exposure to Western ideas and values, but she is ultimately bound by the expectations of her family and community. 

The author's dedication of the story to the women of America serves as a reminder of the universal struggles and aspirations of women across cultures and societies. The story of Kuei Ping and her journey serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of understanding and empathy in bridging the gaps between different cultures and societies. 

The narrative is rich in sensory details, with vivid descriptions of the Street of Precious Pearls, the shop, and the jewels. The characters are well-developed, with complex motivations and emotions. The story raises important questions about the role of women in society, the importance of family and heritage, and the challenges of navigating different cultural expectations. 

Overall, the story is a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience, one that highlights the commonalities and differences between women across cultures and societies. The author's use of language is evocative and engaging, making the story a compelling read. 

The themes of the story are timeless and universal, making it a relevant and important work of literature. The author's ability to craft a narrative that is both deeply personal and broadly relatable is a testament to their skill as a storyteller. The story of Kuei Ping and her journey is one that will resonate with readers long after they finish the book. 

The story also explores the idea of identity and how it is shaped by cultural and societal expectations. Kuei Ping's struggle to reconcile her desire for freedom with her loyalty to her family is a powerful example of the challenges that many women face in navigating their identities. 

The author's use of imagery and symbolism adds depth and complexity to the narrative, making it a rich and rewarding read. The pearls, in particular, serve as a powerful symbol of Kuei Ping's connection to her family and her heritage, as well as her desire for freedom and independence. 

The story is also notable for its exploration of the relationships between women, particularly the bond between Kuei Ping and her grandmother. The author portrays the women in the story as strong and independent, with their own agency and motivations.
