You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: In 1820, it was known that a great city of Ancient Egypt existed in Middle Egypt, on the east bank of the Nile. The Prussian exploration expedition of 1842-45 investigated the site and found extensive ruins near the village of Haggi Kandil, covering the floor of a rock-bound valley named El Amarna. The city's remains were well-preserved due to its sudden and violent downfall. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl discovered a number of crumbling wooden chests filled with clay tablets covered in writing.

The tablets were written in Babylonian cuneiform and were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV. Many of the tablets were letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. Some letters were from Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, and a few were from the Foreign Office of the Egyptian king. The tablets revealed that the Semitic speech of Babylon served as the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C.

The tablets were found to be written in a new and peculiar style, with some featuring hieroglyphic names of King Amenophis IV and his father, Amenophis III. Alabaster slabs were also discovered, which had served as lids to the chests. The tablets were written by professional scribes, who sometimes struggled with the script and language. The scribes used various techniques, such as separating words with thin red lines, to improve their fluency.

The Egyptian court and administration during the Tell el Amarna period were characterized by a shift away from war and towards more peaceful pursuits. Amenophis III, who reigned for 36 years, focused on building and cultivating "wisdom." His son, Amenophis IV, attempted to reform the Egyptian religion, introducing a kind of monotheism that worshipped the disk of the sun, known as the Aten.

The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was built and consecrated, and the royal court moved from Thebes to Tell el Amarna. The officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and Ai, a secretary of state, received golden honors. Other officials, such as Dudu, Amanappa, and Hani, held important positions and received royal commissions. The governorship of Lower Egypt, known as Yarimuta, was filled by Yanhamu.

The Aten dogma was seen as heretical, as it was based on natural phenomena rather than mythology. The hymns to Aten found on the walls of tombs expressed devout feeling and a monotheistic tendency. However, the dogma may not have represented real progress in religious thought, as similar characteristics can be found in hymns to other deities. The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets provided valuable insights into the language, culture, and politics of the Ancient East during this period. The tablets also revealed the complexities of the Egyptian court and administration, including the relationships between officials and the king. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource, offering a unique glimpse into the lives and beliefs of the people of Ancient Egypt and the Near East.
