You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born on March 16, 1822, in Bordeaux, France, to a family of modest means. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a painter and drawing master who had to work hard to support his family. Rosa's mother, Sophie Marquis, was a music teacher who had to stop working after Rosa's birth. Rosa was a precocious child who started drawing and painting at a young age. She was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners, which would stay with her throughout her life.

The Bonheur family moved to Paris in 1829, where Raymond hoped to find better opportunities. Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school, where she was known for her energetic and turbulent behavior. She was eventually expelled from the school and allowed to stay at home, where she could focus on her art. Her father set up a studio in their home, where Rosa would spend hours sketching and painting.

Rosa's father encouraged her to develop her artistic skills, and she quickly showed a talent for painting. She would often accompany her father on his rounds, visiting slaughterhouses, markets, and the Museum to study animals. She also made anatomical studies and even did some dissection to improve her understanding of animal anatomy.

As Rosa grew older, she began to develop her own style, which was characterized by its honesty and attention to detail. She believed that line-work was the foundation of good art and spent hours practicing and perfecting her technique. Her hard work paid off, and she eventually started sending her paintings to the Salon, where they were met with critical acclaim.

In 1842, Rosa sent three paintings to the Salon, including "Evening Effect in a Pasture" and "A Cow lying in a Pasture." She also exhibited a terra-cotta sculpture, "The Shorn Sheep," which received positive reviews from critics. Rosa's success at the Salon marked the beginning of her career as a professional artist, and she would go on to become one of the most celebrated painters of her time.

Rosa's family life was marked by hardship and tragedy, including the death of her mother in 1833. Her father remarried, but Rosa remained close to her siblings and continued to pursue her artistic passion. Despite the challenges she faced, Rosa remained dedicated to her craft, and her talent and perseverance ultimately paid off.

Throughout her life, Rosa was known for her love of animals and her ability to capture their spirit and movement on canvas. She was a true original, and her art continues to inspire and delight people to this day. Rosa's story is a testament to the power of hard work and determination, and her legacy serves as a reminder that with passion and dedication, anything is possible.
