You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their journey to becoming a teacher, which was not their initial career aspiration. During their college days, teaching was not considered a prestigious profession. However, after graduation, the author decided to become a teacher to save their pride. The author notes that this was not a unique situation, as many of their associates also entered the teaching profession without a clear passion for it.

In contrast, the author highlights the growth of the Bahá'í community and its increasing influence in various countries. The community's social and economic development projects have gained respect in governmental and academic circles. The author also describes the pre-Industrial Revolution era, where villages were self-contained units with craftsmen and agriculturists working together.

The author visits two schools, one with a janitor who is unsure about the arrangement of desks and another with a young teacher who is enthusiastic about offering an agriculture course. The author notes the difference in attitude and approach between the two individuals. The young teacher's dedication and passion for teaching are evident, and he eventually becomes the head of a large consolidated high school.

The author emphasizes the importance of considering one's strengths and weaknesses when entering the teaching profession. Many young teachers fail because they have not thought about the type of work they are best suited for. Boards of education evaluate applicants based on personality, preparation, and experience. A pleasing and forceful personality is crucial for a teacher's success, and it should be cultivated.

The author shares their own experience of being influenced by a principal's attractive personality, which inspired them to complete their high school education. They also stress the importance of making a good personal impression, including dressing appropriately for a business call. The author recounts an incident where a young woman's extreme attire made her unsuitable for a commercial teaching position.

The author notes that mediocre preparation will no longer be accepted in the field of education. Teachers must have a good general education and specialize in their chosen field. They should also continue to broaden their general education to avoid narrowing their viewpoint. The author advises teachers to be careful when filling out application blanks and to secure permission from references before using their names.

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of professionalism in teaching. A teacher should never cease to utilize opportunities for broadening their general education and should always be desirous of making a good personal impression. The author's experiences and observations highlight the difference between a teacher who views their work as a job and one who views it as a profession.
