You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The introduction to Will Bradley's book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts. Bradley's work brought a fresh and vibrant style to the field, which was previously stagnant. He is credited with introducing American colonial typography and creating a unique, non-archaic, and exuberant design style. Bradley's career spanned several decades, and he worked on various projects, including magazines, newspapers, and advertising.

Despite his modest nature, Bradley's work had a profound influence on his time. He entered a "closed and stuffy room" in the American graphic arts scene and opened it up to new ideas and styles. Bradley's work was not derivative of European styles, but rather a genuine American art form. He was a pioneer in his field and paved the way for future generations of designers.

The chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" tells the story of Bradley's childhood and early career. Born in 1875, Bradley grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts, and developed an interest in art and printing at a young age. He attended school, but his family's financial situation forced him to drop out and start working at a young age. Bradley's first job was at the Iron Agitator, a newspaper in Ishpeming, Michigan, where he worked as a printer's devil and learned the trade.

Bradley's early career was marked by hard work and determination. He worked long hours in difficult conditions, often in cold and cramped printing shops. Despite these challenges, he persevered and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a job printer and eventually a foreman. Bradley's experiences as a young printer had a lasting impact on his career and influenced his later work as a designer.

As a young man, Bradley was fascinated by the world of printing and design. He spent hours watching printers at work and learning about the different techniques and technologies involved. Bradley's curiosity and enthusiasm for printing and design drove him to succeed in his career and make a lasting impact on the field. Throughout his life, Bradley remained committed to his craft and continued to innovate and push the boundaries of what was possible in graphic design.

Bradley's legacy extends far beyond his own work. He inspired a generation of designers and helped to shape the course of American graphic arts. His influence can still be seen today, and his work remains a testament to his innovative spirit and creative genius. Despite his retirement, Bradley's work continues to be celebrated and admired, and his impact on the world of design remains unparalleled. Overall, Will Bradley's story is one of talent, hard work, and determination, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence designers to this day.
