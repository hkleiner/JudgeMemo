You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, suggesting that its magic has been lost for many adults. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, with secrets and surprises building up to the big day. However, as people grow older, they often lose this sense of wonder and enthusiasm. The author argues that this is not just a natural result of aging, but rather a sign of a deeper cultural shift.

The author notes that children still maintain the spirit of Christmas, but adults often have to force themselves to get into the holiday mood. This is in contrast to other vacations, like summer holidays, where people naturally feel a sense of excitement and relaxation. The author suggests that the decline of Christmas spirit is not just a personal issue, but a societal one.

The author identifies the rise of skepticism and scientific inquiry in the 19th century as a key factor in the decline of Christmas spirit. The work of philosophers and scientists like Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, and Huxley led to a greater emphasis on reason and evidence, which in turn led to a decline in faith and traditional beliefs. This shift has had a profound impact on Western culture, making it more difficult for people to believe in the magic of Christmas.

Despite this, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas - faith, goodwill, and charity - remain essential to human existence. The author suggests that people are still drawn to the idea of Christmas, even if they don't believe in its traditional trappings. This is evident in the way people strive to keep the Christmas spirit alive, both for themselves and for their children.

The author concludes that the decline of Christmas spirit is not just a result of personal aging or cultural shift, but a complex interplay of factors. However, the author also suggests that the core principles of Christmas remain vital and relevant, and that people can still find meaning and joy in the holiday season. Ultimately, the author argues that Christmas is not just a holiday, but a state of mind - one that values faith, goodwill, and charity. By embracing these principles, people can recapture the magic of Christmas, even in a skeptical and rational age. The author's message is one of hope and renewal, encouraging readers to look beyond the surface level of Christmas and connect with its deeper meaning.
