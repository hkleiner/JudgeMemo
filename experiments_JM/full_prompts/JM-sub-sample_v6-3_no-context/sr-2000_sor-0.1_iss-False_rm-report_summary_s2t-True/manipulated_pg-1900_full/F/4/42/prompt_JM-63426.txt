You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Will Bradley was a renowned American artist, designer, and printer. He was born in 1868 in Boston and grew up in a family of modest means. Bradley's father was a cartoonist who died when he was eight years old. His mother later moved to Ishpeming, Michigan, where Bradley became a printer's devil at the local newspaper. He developed an interest in art and design, and by the age of 15, he was working as a job printer and foreman.

Bradley moved to Chicago in 1886 to pursue a career in art. He worked as an apprentice in the art department of Rand McNally, where he learned about design, engraving, and printing. He later worked as a free-lance artist and designer, creating covers and posters for various publications. In 1895, Bradley established his own printing business, the Wayside Press, in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The Wayside Press was known for its high-quality printing and innovative designs. Bradley was particularly fond of the Caslon typeface and used it extensively in his work. He also designed his own typefaces, including the "Bradley" face, which was later adopted by the American Type Founders. Bradley's work was widely recognized, and he became a leading figure in the field of American design.

In the early 1900s, Bradley worked as an art editor for various magazines, including Collier's and Good Housekeeping. He was responsible for designing covers, layouts, and typography, and his work had a significant impact on the development of American magazine design. Bradley also worked on motion picture projects, including the design of title cards and promotional materials.

Throughout his career, Bradley was known for his innovative and eclectic style, which blended elements of art nouveau, arts and crafts, and modernism. He was a pioneer in the use of color and typography in design, and his work continues to influence designers and artists today. Bradley retired in 1930, but his legacy as a designer, artist, and printer has endured.

In 1954, Bradley was awarded the gold medal of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, recognizing his contributions to the field of graphic design. His work is now held in high esteem, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important American designers of the 20th century. Bradley's story is a testament to the power of creativity, innovation, and hard work, and his legacy continues to inspire designers and artists around the world.

Bradley's autobiography, "Will Bradley: His Chap Book," provides a unique insight into his life and career. The book is a collection of memoirs, written by Bradley himself, which offer a candid and charming account of his experiences as a designer, artist, and printer. The book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of American design and the life and work of this remarkable individual.

Overall, Will Bradley's life and career were marked by innovation, creativity, and a passion for design. His work continues to inspire and influence designers and artists today, and his legacy as a pioneer in the field of American design is secure.
