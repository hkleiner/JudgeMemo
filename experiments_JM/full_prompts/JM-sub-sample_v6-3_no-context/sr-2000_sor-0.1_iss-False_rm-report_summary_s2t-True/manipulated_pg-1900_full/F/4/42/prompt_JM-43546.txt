# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the little Scotch cousins to their American counterparts. The narrator explains that despite differences, the Scottish and American cultures share commonalities, and Scottish legends and stories have an abounding interest for Americans. The preface sets the stage for the story, which follows the adventures of Donald, a young Scottish boy, and his friends.

Donald finds a lost puppy, which he names Rob Roy after his favorite story. He takes the puppy home, and his family decides to keep it if no one claims it. Donald's uncle, Uncle Alan, invites them to visit his home in the Highlands, where they will celebrate his niece Marjorie's birthday. The family prepares for the visit, and Donald is excited to see his uncle's estate, Skylemore.

The story then shifts to Donald's daily life, where he attends school and plays with his friends, including Sandy. They enjoy traditional Scottish games like "beezee" and "boules." On Saturdays, they often go on walks with Donald's father, exploring the city of Edinburgh. One day, they visit the castle and watch the Highland Regiment drill.

Donald's cousins, Janet and Marjorie, arrive in Edinburgh, and they all go on a walk around the city, visiting famous landmarks like the Scott Monument and Holyrood Palace.

The family then heads to Skylemore for Marjorie's birthday party, where they enjoy traditional Scottish games and food.

In the summer, the family goes on a picnic to Loch Katrine, where they enjoy traditional Scottish food and sing songs like "Annie Laurie." They also visit the home of Robert Burns, Scotland's national poet, and learn about his life and works. The story concludes with the family's summer holidays, where they go on a cruise around the islands off the coast of Scotland and enjoy various excursions.
