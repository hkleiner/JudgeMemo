You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 1538, a writ of summons was sent to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, to answer charges of treason. The Archbishop's bones were to be burnt, and his shrine forfeited to the Crown. However, the remains were not burned, but every statue, wall-painting, and window of Thomas Becket was destroyed.

Despite this, Canterbury remains a significant pilgrimage site, with many visitors traveling to the city to see the Cathedral and other historic sites. The Pilgrims' Way from Winchester to Canterbury is a popular route, and many modern pilgrims use the railway to reach the city. However, walking the old road provides a more authentic experience, with beautiful views of the surrounding hills and the Cathedral.

The story of Canterbury begins with the Roman invasion of Britain, and the city's importance grew during the Roman occupation. The Romans called the city Durovernum, and it was an important center for trade and commerce. After the Roman withdrawal, the city was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Saxons, who named it Cantwarabyrig.

In 597, Augustine landed in Kent and began to convert the Saxons to Christianity. He established his headquarters in Canterbury and built several churches, including the Cathedral. The city became an important center for Christianity, and the Cathedral was rebuilt several times over the centuries.

The most famous event in Canterbury's history is the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170. Becket was Archbishop of Canterbury and was killed by four knights in the Cathedral. The event shocked Europe and led to a wave of pilgrimages to Canterbury. The Cathedral was rebuilt, and a shrine to Becket was established, which became a major pilgrimage site.

Today, Canterbury is a thriving city with many historic sites, including the Cathedral, St. Martin's Church, and St. Augustine's Abbey. The city walls and gates are still standing, and the West Gate is a notable landmark. The city has a rich cultural heritage, with many museums, galleries, and historic buildings to explore.

The Cathedral is a magnificent building with a long history, and it is still an important center for Christianity today. The city is also home to several other historic churches, including St. Dunstan's and St. Martin's. The Castle, which dates back to the Norman Conquest, is another notable landmark, although it is currently used as a storage facility.

Overall, Canterbury is a city with a rich history and culture, and it continues to be an important pilgrimage site and tourist destination. Its historic sites, including the Cathedral and city walls, are a testament to its significance in English history. The city's cultural heritage is still celebrated today, with many festivals and events taking place throughout the year.
