You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" highlights Russia's significant contributions to the Allied effort during World War I. The author, Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, argues that Russia's sacrifices were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war. Russia's losses were staggering, with over 12 million casualties, including 3 million dead. This was more than twice the losses of France, four to five times those of England, and over 35 times those of America.

Russia's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia diverted German forces, preventing them from concentrating on France. This forced Germany to fight on two fronts, ultimately leading to their defeat. Russia's efforts also helped to save Italy from Austrian forces and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme and at Verdun.

In 1915, Russia single-handedly fought against Germany, Austria, and Turkey, giving the Allies a year to prepare for the coming German offensive. Russia's losses were immense, with some corps having only 1,500 bayonets instead of 40,000. Despite being unprepared and lacking arms and munitions, Russia continued to fight, diverting German forces and preventing them from concentrating on the Western front.

The German General Staff, led by Ludendorf, attempted to discredit Russia's efforts, but their own memoirs reveal the significant impact of Russia's operations. Ludendorf admitted that the transfer of German forces to the Eastern front had fatal consequences for Germany. Russia's sacrifices and efforts ultimately contributed to the Allied victory, and their role in the war should not be underestimated.

The pamphlet concludes that Russia's participation in the war was essential, and without it, Germany would have likely dominated Europe and possibly the world. Russia's immense losses and sacrifices demonstrate their commitment to the Allied cause, and their role in the war should be recognized and respected. The pamphlet also notes that Russia's future role in European politics and military equilibrium will be significant, and that the country will always remain a heavy military weight that cannot be ignored.
