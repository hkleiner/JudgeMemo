You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a French painter born in 1822 to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a painter and drawing master who encouraged her early interest in art. Rosa's mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician who shared the family's love of art. The family struggled financially, and Rosa's father worked as a drawing master to support them.

Rosa began drawing and painting at a young age and was largely self-taught. She would often accompany her father on his rounds of private lessons and observe the animals in the countryside. Her father eventually allowed her to use his studio, where she would sketch and paint.

In 1829, the family moved to Paris, where Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school. She developed boyish manners and a love of adventure, which would stay with her throughout her life. The family struggled during the revolution of 1830, and Rosa's father was forced to change their residence several times.

Rosa's passion for art only grew stronger, and she began to study the works of the great masters at the Louvre. She developed a unique style, focusing on animal paintings and landscapes. Her breakthrough came in 1841 when two of her paintings were accepted into the Salon.

Rosa's success was gradual, but she eventually gained recognition and acclaim. She became known for her honest and conscientious approach to art, and her paintings were praised for their sincerity and vigor. In 1849, she was awarded a medal for her painting "Ploughing in the Nivernais," which was purchased by the state for the Museum of the Luxembourg.

Rosa continued to work tirelessly, producing many notable paintings, including "The Horse Fair," which brought her widespread recognition. She was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1865 and became a celebrated artist in France and abroad.

Rosa's personal life was marked by a deep friendship with Nathalie Micas, who lived with her and managed her household. After Nathalie's death in 1889, Rosa was heartbroken but continued to work, producing some of her most notable paintings. She eventually found comfort in a new friendship with Anna Klumpke, an American artist who became her companion and legatee.

Rosa Bonheur died on May 25, 1899, at the age of 77, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest animal painters of all time. Her funeral was attended by many prominent figures from the art world, and she was buried in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise. Rosa's life and work continue to inspire artists and art lovers to this day. She remains a celebrated figure in the art world, known for her talent, her passion, and her dedication to her craft.
