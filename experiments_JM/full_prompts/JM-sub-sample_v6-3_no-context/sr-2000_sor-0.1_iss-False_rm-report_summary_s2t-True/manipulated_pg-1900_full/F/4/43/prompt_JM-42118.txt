You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. He grew up in a romantic and beautiful environment, surrounded by olive trees and the Mediterranean Sea. Fragonard's father wanted him to pursue a career in commerce, but he was drawn to art. At 16, he moved to Paris to study art under François Boucher, a renowned painter. Boucher recognized Fragonard's talent and took him under his wing, teaching him the techniques of painting.

Fragonard's early work was influenced by Boucher's style, and he quickly gained recognition for his talent. He won the Prix de Rome in 1752, which allowed him to study in Italy for three years. During his time in Italy, Fragonard was exposed to the works of great masters, including Raphael and Michelangelo. However, he struggled to find his own style and was torn between his French heritage and the Italian influence.

Upon his return to Paris, Fragonard's career took off, and he became known for his elegant and charming paintings. He was particularly famous for his landscapes and scenes of everyday life. Fragonard's work was highly sought after by the nobility and wealthy merchants, who admired his ability to capture the beauty of the French countryside.

In 1769, Fragonard married Marie Anne Gérard, a young woman from Grasse. The couple had two children, and Fragonard's marriage marked a turning point in his career. He began to focus more on family life and less on his artistic ambitions. Fragonard's wife was not a beauty, but she had a kind heart and was a good mother to their children.

Fragonard's career continued to flourish, and he became one of the most celebrated painters of his time. He was known for his ability to capture the essence of the French spirit, and his paintings were highly prized by collectors. However, with the outbreak of the French Revolution, Fragonard's career began to decline. The new regime rejected the elegant and charming style of painting that Fragonard was known for, and he struggled to adapt to the changing artistic landscape.

In 1793, Fragonard's daughter Rosalie died, and he was devastated by her loss. The following year, he moved to Grasse, where he lived in exile for several years. During this time, he continued to paint, but his work was no longer in demand. Fragonard returned to Paris in 1800, but he was no longer the celebrated painter he once was. He died on August 22, 1806, at the age of 74, and was buried in the cemetery of Montmartre.

Despite his decline in popularity during his lifetime, Fragonard's work has endured, and he is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of the 18th century. His paintings continue to charm and delight audiences with their elegance, beauty, and joie de vivre. Fragonard's legacy is a testament to the power of art to capture the spirit of an era and to transcend time. His work remains a beloved and integral part of French cultural heritage, and his name is synonymous with the elegance and charm of 18th-century France.
