You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 597, Augustine landed on the island of Ebbsfleet and began to preach and instruct the people of Canterbury. The city became a major center of Christianity in England, and the Cathedral was built. In 1170, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered in the Cathedral, leading to a wave of pilgrims visiting the city. The pilgrims' way from Winchester to Canterbury became a popular route, and the city prospered.

The Cathedral was rebuilt and expanded over the centuries, with various architects and builders contributing to its design. The Trinity Chapel, where Becket's shrine was located, is a notable feature of the Cathedral. The chapel contains a mosaic pavement, tombs of notable figures, and stunning stained-glass windows. The city of Canterbury is still surrounded by its medieval walls, with the West Gate being the only remaining gate.

The city has a number of historic buildings, including St. Martin's Church, which is one of the oldest churches in England. The church is believed to have been built on the site of a Roman church, and its font is thought to be a relic of Saxon times. The city is also home to St. Augustine's Abbey, which was founded by Augustine in 597. The abbey was converted into a palace after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and was later restored and converted into a missionary college.

Canterbury has a number of other historic sites, including the Castle, which features a great Norman keep, and the remains of the Black and Grey Friars' buildings. The city also has a number of interesting churches, hospitals, and old inns. The city's museum is also worth visiting, with its collection of artifacts and exhibits on the city's history. Despite the passage of time, Canterbury remains a city steeped in history and tradition, with its medieval architecture and historic sites continuing to attract visitors from around the world.

The Cathedral's history is closely tied to the city's, with the two being inextricably linked. The Cathedral has undergone numerous changes and expansions over the centuries, with various styles and architectures being represented. The building is a testament to the city's rich history and its importance as a center of Christianity. The city's walls and gates, although not all remaining, are still an impressive feature of the city's landscape.

Overall, Canterbury is a city with a rich and varied history, from its early beginnings as a Roman settlement to its current status as a thriving city with a strong sense of tradition and heritage. The city's historic sites, including the Cathedral, St. Martin's Church, and St. Augustine's Abbey, are a major part of its appeal, and its medieval architecture and charming streets make it a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims alike.
