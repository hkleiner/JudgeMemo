You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reign of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets were letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters revealed the difficulties of the script and language, with scribes using Babylonian mythological texts to improve their fluency.

The tablets also showed that the Egyptian court was in a state of turmoil, with the Pharaoh's attempts at reforming the religion causing resistance from the powerful priests of Amon. The king's officials were divided, with some supporting the new doctrine and others remaining loyal to the old religion. The tablets mentioned the king's altered throne-name, "Akhen-Aten," and the changing of names to reflect the new doctrine.

The letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani, revealed the complexities of diplomatic relations in the ancient East. The kings exchanged gifts, including gold, and negotiated marriages to secure alliances. However, the Egyptian Pharaoh's reluctance to give away his daughters in marriage caused difficulties in diplomatic relations.

The tablets also revealed the struggles of the Egyptian vassals in Syria and Canaan, who were plagued by wars, tribute demands, and the immigration of Bedawin tribes. The vassals often appealed to the Pharaoh for help, but the Egyptian government's response was often inadequate. The tablets mentioned the role of Yanhamu, the governor of Lower Egypt, who wielded significant power and influence over the vassals.

The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Aziru, Rib-Addi, and Abdi-kheba, provided insight into the political conditions of the time. Aziru, in particular, was a powerful and cunning vassal who expanded his territory through conquest and diplomacy. The tablets also mentioned the presence of the Habiri, a group of people who were later identified as the Hebrews, in the region.

The Tell el Amarna period was marked by significant political upheaval, with the Egyptian empire facing challenges from the Hittites, Mitani, and other powers. The kingdom of Mitani, in particular, was nearing its fall, and its king, Tushratta, was desperate to secure an alliance with Egypt. The tablets revealed the complexities of the political landscape, with shifting alliances and rivalries between the various powers.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has provided significant insights into the history of the ancient East, revealing the complexities of diplomatic relations, the struggles of the Egyptian vassals, and the political upheaval of the time. The tablets have also shed light on the religious reforms of Pharaoh Akhenaten and the eventual decline of the XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are a valuable resource for understanding the history of the ancient Near East.
