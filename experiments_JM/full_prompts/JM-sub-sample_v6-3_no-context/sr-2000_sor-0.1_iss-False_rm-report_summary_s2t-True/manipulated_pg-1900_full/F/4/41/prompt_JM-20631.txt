You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of Judaism. The foreword, written by Herbert Samuel, introduces the series of lectures in memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar of Hebrew language and literature. Davis was a self-taught expert who made significant contributions to the field, including a volume on Hebrew accents and a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book.

The first chapter discusses the claim that Jews are a chosen people, which has been a source of irritation for non-Jews throughout history. The author argues that this concept is often misunderstood and that the Jewish Bible is not a tribal or nationalistic text, but rather a universal and ethical one. The book of Isaiah, for example, contains passages that emphasize the importance of justice, righteousness, and compassion.

The second chapter explores the idea that the Jewish people have a mission to fulfill, which is to bring light and salvation to the world. The author argues that this mission is not based on a sense of superiority, but rather on a sense of responsibility and obligation to serve humanity. The concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism, and other nations, such as America and England, have also claimed a special mission or destiny.

The third chapter discusses the evolution of the concept of a chosen people in Jewish thought and literature. The author argues that the idea of election is not a static concept, but rather a dynamic and evolving one that has been shaped by historical and cultural contexts. The Talmud, for example, contains passages that emphasize the importance of universalism and the rejection of tribalism.

The fourth chapter explores the idea that the concept of a chosen people is not limited to Judaism, but can be found in other cultures and nations. The author argues that the idea of a national mission or destiny is a common phenomenon that can be seen in various forms of nationalism and imperialism. The example of England is cited, where the concept of a chosen people has evolved over time, from a sense of insular patriotism to a more universal and imperial mission.

The fifth chapter discusses the differences between Judaism and Germanism, which is seen as a form of nationalism that emphasizes the superiority of the German people. The author argues that Germanism is a perversion of the idea of a chosen people, which is based on a sense of responsibility and obligation to serve humanity, rather than a sense of superiority and dominance.

The sixth chapter explores the idea that the concept of a chosen people is not a fixed or static concept, but rather a dynamic and evolving one that can be shaped by historical and cultural contexts. The author argues that the idea of election is not limited to Judaism, but can be found in other cultures and nations, and that it is a universal and human phenomenon.

The seventh chapter discusses the importance of criticism and self-reflection in the concept of a chosen people. The author argues that the Jewish people have a long tradition of criticizing and reflecting on their own flaws and weaknesses, and that this is an essential part of the concept of a chosen people. The example of England is cited, where the concept of a chosen people has been subject to criticism and reflection, particularly in the context of imperialism and nationalism.

The eighth chapter explores the idea that the concept of a chosen people is not limited to the past, but has relevance and importance in the present and future. The author argues that the idea of election is a call to action and a reminder of the responsibility and obligation to serve humanity. The example of Abraham Lincoln is cited, who saw the importance of universalism and the rejection of tribalism, and who believed that the future of humanity depended on the ability to transcend national and cultural boundaries.

The afterword, written by Dr. Israel Abrahams, pays tribute to the memory of Arthur Davis, who was a scholar and a teacher of Hebrew language and literature. Abrahams reflects on the importance of Davis's work and legacy, and argues that his contributions to the field of Hebrew studies will continue to inspire and educate future generations.
