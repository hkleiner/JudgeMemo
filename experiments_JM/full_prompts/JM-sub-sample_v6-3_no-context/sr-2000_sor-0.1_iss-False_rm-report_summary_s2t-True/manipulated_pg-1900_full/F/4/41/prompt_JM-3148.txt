You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violin maker who lives with his nephew Davy. Anthony is a skilled musician who can hear the secrets of the universe in the strings of his violin. He believes that the secret of everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his instrument. 

Davy reads to Anthony from an old instruction book about Paganini's disastrous triumphs. Anthony is fascinated by the story and begins to play his violin, creating a beautiful and haunting melody. The music has a profound effect on Lyddy Ann Butterfield, a disfigured and lonely woman who lives nearby. 

Lyddy has a tragic past, having been burned as a child, and has lived a life of solitude and loneliness. However, when she hears Anthony's music, she feels a sense of joy and connection that she has never experienced before. She begins to visit Anthony and Davy, helping with household chores and caring for Davy when he falls ill. 

As Lyddy spends more time with Anthony, she finds herself opening up to him in ways she never thought possible. She is drawn to his kind and gentle nature, and he is touched by her beauty and strength. Despite their differences, they form a deep and meaningful connection. 

Aunt Hitty Tarbox, a nosy and opinionated neighbor, notices the growing relationship between Anthony and Lyddy and begins to spread rumors and speculation. However, Anthony and Lyddy are oblivious to the gossip and continue to nurture their blossoming love. 

As the story progresses, Anthony and Lyddy's relationship deepens, and they find comfort and solace in each other's company. Anthony proposes to Lyddy, and she accepts, despite her initial reservations about marrying a blind man. 

The story concludes with Anthony and Lyddy sitting in their apple orchard, surrounded by the beauty of nature. Anthony is working on a new musical composition, using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs to create a staff. Lyddy is sewing a basket, symbolizing their hopes and dreams for the future. 

Davy, who has been reading Shakespeare, is called upon to interpret Anthony's music, and he describes it as the song of the green things growing in the apple orchard. Lyddy adds that the music is a dream of the future, full of sweetness, promise, and hope. Anthony is touched by her words and kisses her, symbolizing their love and connection. 

The story is a beautiful and poignant exploration of the human spirit, highlighting the transformative power of love, music, and connection. Despite the challenges and hardships that Anthony and Lyddy face, they find joy, comfort, and solace in each other's company, and their love becomes a source of strength and inspiration.
