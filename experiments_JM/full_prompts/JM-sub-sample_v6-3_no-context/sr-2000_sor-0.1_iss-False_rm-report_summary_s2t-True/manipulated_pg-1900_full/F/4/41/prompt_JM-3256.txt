You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the nature of a bookman, someone who has a deep love and appreciation for books. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but rather someone who has a passion for reading and collecting books. The author recounts a story of a man who invited him to dinner and showed off his impressive library, but it was clear that the man was more interested in the physical appearance of the books than their content.

The author notes that a true bookman is born, not made, and that they have a natural ability to distinguish between good and bad literature. They are not swayed by popular opinion or critical reviews, but rather follow their own instincts and tastes. The author cites the example of a colonial squatter who, despite having no formal education, was able to appreciate the works of William Shakespeare and John Milton.

A bookman's love of books is not limited to any particular genre or subject, but rather they are drawn to anything that is well-written and thought-provoking. They may enjoy reading detective stories, essays, or historical romances, and they are not afraid to express their opinions and tastes. The author notes that a bookman's love of books is often hereditary, and that it can be a source of comfort and solace in times of trouble.

The author also reflects on the joys of collecting books, and the thrill of the hunt for rare and hard-to-find volumes. They note that a bookman's collection is often a reflection of their personality and tastes, and that it can be a source of pride and joy. However, the author also acknowledges that a bookman's love of books can sometimes be a source of conflict and tension, particularly in their personal relationships.

Despite the challenges and pitfalls, the author concludes that being a bookman is a wonderful and rewarding experience. It allows one to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, and to explore the vast and rich world of literature. The author notes that a bookman's love of books is not just a hobby or a pastime, but rather a way of life, and that it can bring joy, comfort, and fulfillment to those who pursue it.

The author also mentions that a bookman's love of books can be a source of inspiration and guidance, and that it can help to shape their values and beliefs. They note that a bookman's collection is often a reflection of their values and priorities, and that it can be a source of comfort and solace in times of trouble. The author concludes by noting that a bookman's love of books is a lifelong journey, and that it can bring joy and fulfillment to those who pursue it.

In addition, the author talks about the bookman's relationship with his books, how he handles them, and how he takes care of them. He also mentions the bookman's desire to share his love of books with others, and how he would like to invite other bookmen to discuss and share their passion for books. The author also quotes several authors and bookmen, including Sainte-Beuve, who said that a book is a classic if it has wisdom and a form that rises above the limitation of any single age.

Overall, the author's reflection on the nature of a bookman is a celebration of the joy and beauty of books, and the importance of cultivating a love of reading and literature. It is a tribute to the bookmen and women who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and who have found comfort, solace, and fulfillment in the pages of a good book.
