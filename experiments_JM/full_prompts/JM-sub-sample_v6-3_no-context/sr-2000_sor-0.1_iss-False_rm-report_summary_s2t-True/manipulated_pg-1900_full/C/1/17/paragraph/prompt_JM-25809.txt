You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Jim, a miner, who is struggling to find success in Sweet Briar Gulch. He receives a letter from his lover, Anne, who refuses to marry him due to his lack of financial stability. Jim is heartbroken and feels like giving up. However, his friend Bud, the mail-carrier, arrives and offers him encouragement and support. Bud lends Jim a burro, and Jim decides to take a trip to Plattsburg, where he meets a young boy named Ches, who is being abused by his supposed father.

Jim rescues Ches and decides to take him in, giving him a new name, Chescheela James Felton. Ches is a street-smart kid who has been through a lot, but he is also kind and grateful. Jim and Ches form a strong bond, and Jim starts to see Ches as a son. They return to Jim's cabin, where they work together to build a new life. Jim starts to work on his claim again, determined to succeed for Anne and Ches.

As they work, Jim and Ches grow closer, and Jim teaches Ches about the importance of hard work and perseverance. However, their happiness is short-lived, as the tunnel collapses, trapping Jim inside. Ches is devastated but manages to stay calm and finds help from a group of miners, led by Captain Hanrahan. They work together to rescue Jim, and eventually, they succeed in pulling him out of the tunnel.

Jim is injured but alive, and he is grateful to Ches and the miners for saving his life. As he recovers, he receives a new letter from Anne, who has had a change of heart and is now willing to marry him, regardless of his financial situation. Jim is overjoyed and feels like he can finally rest easy. The story ends with Jim, Ches, and Bud happy and content, surrounded by the beauty of nature.

The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the plot is engaging and suspenseful. The story also explores themes of identity, community, and the human condition. Overall, the narrative is a heartwarming and inspiring tale of hope and redemption.
