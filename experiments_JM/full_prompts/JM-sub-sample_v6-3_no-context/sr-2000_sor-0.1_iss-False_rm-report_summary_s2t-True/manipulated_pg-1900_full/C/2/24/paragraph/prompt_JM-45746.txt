You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their journey to becoming a schoolmaster, starting with their college days when they didn't consider teaching as a career. However, after graduation, they found themselves unprepared for a definite position and decided to become a teacher. The author notes that many young men and women enter the educational field without considering the type of work they are best fitted to do, leading to a large percentage of teacher failures.

To succeed as a teacher, one needs a pleasing yet forceful personality, good preparation, and experience. The author emphasizes the importance of self-examination and study to realize one's strengths and limitations. They also highlight the need for teachers to be desirous of making a good personal impression and to be mindful of their attire and demeanor.

The author shares their experience of attending county, sectional, state, and national teachers' meetings to stay updated on current school problems and educational leaders. They also discuss the importance of teachers' meetings, where teachers can share suggestions and ideas to improve their work. The author notes that some superintendents may not provide adequate support or guidance to their teachers, leading to a lack of cooperation and success.

In addition, the author emphasizes the importance of the principal's role in helping teachers, including providing assistance with exceptional children, interpreting the course of study, and offering professional leadership. They also highlight the need for principals to have a good personal relationship with their teachers, characterized by higher human qualities such as approachability and a willingness to listen.

The author discusses the significance of the school's relationship with the community, including the need for vocational guidance and adjustment to proper vocations. They note that the school's enrollment is growing rapidly, and with it, the problem of diversity of student ability to serve. The author suggests that schools should study the industrial and commercial conditions in their locality and offer special subjects that the district can afford.

Furthermore, the author shares an example of a club organization in a high school, where students were divided into groups based on their interests and met with outside speakers to learn about different vocations. The author also notes that many student difficulties are due to the unfamiliarity of parents with what the school has to offer, and that schools should make an effort to inform parents about the available courses and programs.

Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of teachers, principals, and schools working together to provide a well-rounded education that prepares students for their future careers. They also highlight the need for ongoing professional development and support for teachers to ensure their success and the success of their students. By working together, schools can make a positive impact on their communities and help students achieve their full potential. The author's experiences and insights offer valuable lessons for educators and administrators seeking to improve their schools and support their students.
