You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violin maker who lives with his nephew Davy. Anthony is a skilled musician who can hear the music in everything, and his violin is his most precious possession. Davy reads to Anthony from an old instruction book, and they discuss the story of Paggernyner, a musician who improvised on the violin.

Anthony's past is revealed, showing his struggles in school and his love for music and nature. He was a curious and wondering child, always asking questions and seeking answers. As he grew older, he became skilled in repairing musical instruments and eventually made his own violin.

The story then introduces Lyddy Ann Butterfield, a disfigured and lonely woman who has inherited a house and a small income from her aunt. She is a kind and gentle soul, loved by the children she has cared for in the past. Lyddy is drawn to Anthony's music and begins to visit him, helping with household chores and caring for Davy when he is sick.

As Lyddy and Anthony spend more time together, they develop a deep and tender passion for each other. Anthony is smitten with Lyddy's kindness, intelligence, and beauty, despite her physical scars. Lyddy, in turn, is touched by Anthony's music and his gentle nature. They eventually get married, and Lyddy becomes Anthony's partner in every sense, helping him with his music and his daily life.

The story also introduces Aunt Hitty Tarbox, a nosy and opinionated woman who loves to gossip and interfere in other people's lives. She is critical of Lyddy and Anthony's relationship, but ultimately, their love prevails. The story concludes with Anthony and Lyddy sitting in their apple orchard, surrounded by nature's beauty, and Anthony playing his violin. Lyddy is sewing a basket, symbolizing their hopes and dreams for the future. The music is a reflection of their love and happiness, and the story ends on a note of joy and contentment.
