You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. The Romans invaded the area, and Julius Caesar described the people of Kent as being similar to the Gauls. The Romans built a town called Durovernum, which was an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans left, the town was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Saxons, who named it Cantwarabyrig.

In 597, Augustine arrived in Canterbury and began to convert the Saxons to Christianity. He built several churches, including Christ Church, which became the center of the Christian faith in England. The church was rebuilt and expanded over the centuries, with the addition of the Trinity Chapel and the shrine of Thomas Becket.

Thomas Becket was a prominent figure in Canterbury's history, serving as Archbishop from 1162 until his murder in 1170. His shrine became a popular pilgrimage site, and the city prospered as a result. The cathedral was rebuilt and expanded after a fire in 1174, with the addition of the Gothic-style choir and the Trinity Chapel.

The city's history is also marked by the Norman Conquest, which brought significant changes to the area. The Normans built a new cathedral, which was completed in 1077. The city continued to grow and prosper, with the addition of new buildings, including the hospital of St. Nicholas and the church of St. Martin.

Today, Canterbury is a thriving city with a rich history and culture. Visitors can see many of the city's historic buildings, including the cathedral, the castle, and the old city walls. The city is also home to several museums, including the Canterbury Museum, which showcases the city's history and heritage.

The city's historic center is filled with narrow streets and picturesque buildings, including the famous Mercery Lane. The lane is lined with old buildings, including the 16th-century Weaver's House and the 14th-century Poor Priests' Hospital. The city is also home to several old inns, including the Old Weaver's Inn and the Sun Inn.

Canterbury is also famous for its connections to Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The city is home to the Canterbury Tales attraction, which brings the stories to life through interactive exhibits and reconstructions. Visitors can also see the actual site of the shrine of Thomas Becket, which was destroyed during the Reformation.

In addition to its historic buildings and cultural attractions, Canterbury is also a thriving commercial center. The city is home to several major retailers, including the Whitefriars shopping center. The city also has a vibrant arts scene, with several galleries and performance venues.

Overall, Canterbury is a city with a rich history and culture, offering something for everyone. From its historic buildings and cultural attractions to its thriving commercial center and vibrant arts scene, the city is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history, culture, and entertainment. The city's unique blend of old and new makes it a fascinating place to explore, and its friendly atmosphere makes it a great place to visit. Whether you're interested in history, culture, or simply want to experience a new city, Canterbury is a great choice.
