You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of Judaism. The author discusses how the idea of being chosen has been perceived as arrogant and irritating to non-Jews. The book also examines the history of Jewish thought and learning, highlighting the contributions of scholars such as Arthur Davis. Davis was a renowned Hebrew scholar who wrote extensively on the subject and was instrumental in promoting Jewish education.

The author notes that the concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism, as other nations, such as Germany, have also claimed a special status. However, the Jewish concept of being chosen is distinct in that it is not based on racial or national superiority, but rather on a sense of mission and responsibility to serve as a light unto the nations.

The book also explores the idea that the Jewish people have been preserved as a distinct entity despite centuries of persecution and dispersion. The author suggests that this preservation is due to the Jewish people's commitment to their faith and traditions, as well as their ability to adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances.

The author critiques the idea that the Jewish God is a tribal or partisan deity, arguing that this misconception arises from a misunderstanding of the Hebrew Bible. Instead, the author suggests that the Jewish concept of God is rooted in a sense of universalism and a commitment to justice and righteousness.

The book also examines the relationship between Judaism and other religions, particularly Christianity. The author notes that while Christianity has often been critical of Judaism, many Christian thinkers have also been influenced by Jewish ideas and traditions.

Throughout the book, the author draws on a wide range of sources, including biblical texts, rabbinic literature, and modern Jewish thought. The author also engages with critics of Judaism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, and responds to their arguments.

Ultimately, the book argues that the concept of a chosen people is not a source of arrogance or exclusivity, but rather a call to service and responsibility. The author suggests that the Jewish people's sense of mission and purpose can serve as a model for other nations and communities, and that the values of justice, compassion, and righteousness that are central to Judaism can inspire and guide people of all backgrounds.

The author concludes by noting that the Jewish people's survival and thriving despite centuries of adversity is a testament to the power of their faith and traditions. The book ends with a call to action, urging readers to work towards a more just and compassionate world, and to recognize the importance of preserving and promoting Jewish culture and learning.

In the afterword, Dr. Israel Abrahams pays tribute to Arthur Davis, the scholar in whose memory the book was written. Abrahams praises Davis's scholarship and his commitment to Jewish education, and notes that his work continues to inspire and guide new generations of scholars and learners.
