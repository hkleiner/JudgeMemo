You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a prominent English painter born in 1723. He was known for his exceptional talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career. Reynolds was born under a fortunate star and had a rare mixture of talent and judgment. He was not considered a genius, but his work had certain affinities with the masterpieces of the immortals.

Reynolds' early life was quite uneventful, and he was apprenticed to Thomas Hudson, a portrait painter. He later traveled to Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, including Michelangelo, Titian, and Rembrandt. This experience had a profound impact on his art, and he became one of the greatest portrait painters of his time.

Upon his return to England, Reynolds established himself as a prominent painter and was elected as the first President of the Royal Academy. He was a great assimilator, taking inspiration from various artists and styles, but always maintaining his own unique approach. Reynolds' art was characterized by its simplicity, directness, and expression of character.

He was particularly skilled at painting portraits of men, capturing their essence and personality with remarkable accuracy. His portraits of famous men, such as Charles James Fox and David Garrick, are considered masterpieces. Reynolds' work was not without its limitations, however, and some of his portraits have suffered from the passage of time, with colors fading or being restored.

Despite these limitations, Reynolds' legacy as one of the greatest British painters remains unchallenged. His art continues to inspire and influence artists to this day, and his name is synonymous with excellence in portraiture. Reynolds' life was marked by his dedication to his craft, his love of learning, and his passion for art. He died in 1792, leaving behind a remarkable body of work that continues to be celebrated and admired.

Reynolds' contemporaries, including Gainsborough and Romney, were also notable painters, but Reynolds' unique style and approach set him apart. He was a true master of his craft, and his portraits continue to captivate audiences with their beauty, elegance, and insight into the human character. Throughout his life, Reynolds was driven by a desire to create art that would endure, and his legacy is a testament to his success in achieving this goal.

Reynolds' presidency of the Royal Academy helped establish the institution as a leading center for art and learning. He was a strong advocate for the importance of art in society and worked tirelessly to promote the work of British artists. His discourses, delivered annually to the Royal Academy, are still studied by art historians and scholars today, offering valuable insights into his artistic philosophy and approach.

In conclusion, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a remarkable artist who left an indelible mark on the world of art. His portraits, characterized by their simplicity, directness, and expression of character, continue to inspire and influence artists to this day. His legacy is a testament to his dedication, passion, and commitment to his craft, and his name remains synonymous with excellence in portraiture.
