You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator, a literary critic, recalls his encounter with George Corvick, who had been tasked with reviewing a novel by Hugh Vereker. Corvick was breathless and worried, having received a telegram from Gwendolen Erme, a woman he was in love with. The narrator agrees to prepare an article on Vereker's novel for "The Middle" magazine, which Corvick had promised to write but couldn't due to his sudden departure.

The narrator reads Vereker's novel and writes a review, but Corvick is dissatisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. Corvick believes that Vereker's writing contains a hidden meaning, a "figure in the carpet" that only a select few can see. The narrator is skeptical but intrigued by Corvick's claim.

The narrator meets Vereker at a dinner party and is impressed by his intelligence and wit. However, when Vereker dismisses the narrator's review as "the usual twaddle," the narrator feels embarrassed and humiliated. Later, Vereker reveals to the narrator that his writing does contain a hidden meaning, but he refuses to explain it, saying that it's for the reader to discover.

Corvick becomes obsessed with uncovering Vereker's secret and eventually claims to have discovered it. However, before he can share it with the narrator, he dies in a tragic accident. The narrator is left with a sense of loss and regret, feeling that he has missed out on something important.

The narrator's obsession with Vereker's secret continues, and he becomes fixated on Gwendolen, Corvick's widow, who he believes may hold the key to understanding Vereker's work. However, Gwendolen refuses to share her knowledge with the narrator, saying that it's her "life" and that she will never reveal it.

The narrator's pursuit of Vereker's secret becomes an all-consuming obsession, leading him to make mistakes and misjudgments. He eventually realizes that his quest is futile and that the secret may be lost forever. The story concludes with the narrator reflecting on the elusiveness of Vereker's secret and the devastating consequences of his own obsession.

Throughout the story, the narrator's character is revealed through his interactions with Corvick, Vereker, and Gwendolen. His obsession with Vereker's secret is a driving force behind the plot, and his mistakes and misjudgments serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and the elusiveness of truth.

The story also explores the theme of literary criticism and the search for meaning in art. Vereker's secret is a metaphor for the elusive nature of artistic truth, and the narrator's quest represents the futility of trying to pin down a definitive interpretation. The story ultimately suggests that some secrets may be too great for human understanding, and that the pursuit of knowledge can be a double-edged sword.
