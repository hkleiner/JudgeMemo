You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most of the fighting in the East taking place in Virginia. The Union Army, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, had been trying to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, but had been unsuccessful. Grant decided to attack Petersburg, a city south of Richmond, in an attempt to cut off the Confederate supply lines. The Union Army launched a series of attacks on Petersburg, but the Confederates, led by General Robert E. Lee, were able to hold them off.

The Union Army tried to encircle Petersburg, but the Confederates were able to counter their moves. The Union Army then tried to capture the Weldon Railroad, which was a key supply line for the Confederates. They were successful in capturing a portion of the railroad, but the Confederates were able to retake it. The Union Army then launched a series of attacks on the Confederate lines, but were unable to break through.

In July 1864, the Union Army launched a massive assault on the Confederate lines, known as the Battle of the Crater. The assault was unsuccessful, and the Union Army suffered heavy casualties. The Confederates were able to hold off the Union Army, but at great cost. The Union Army then settled in for a long siege of Petersburg, digging trenches and building fortifications.

The siege of Petersburg lasted for over nine months, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Union Army was able to slowly encircle the city, cutting off the Confederate supply lines. In March 1865, General Lee launched a desperate attack on the Union lines, known as the Battle of Fort Stedman. The attack was unsuccessful, and the Union Army was able to counterattack and capture more of the Confederate lines.

On April 1, 1865, the Union Army launched a final attack on the Confederate lines, known as the Battle of Five Forks. The attack was successful, and the Union Army was able to capture the Southside Railroad, cutting off the last Confederate supply line. The Confederates were forced to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond, and the Union Army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War.

The siege of Petersburg was one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the Civil War, with over 70,000 casualties. The Union Army's victory at Petersburg was a crucial turning point in the war, as it allowed them to capture Richmond and ultimately led to the surrender of the Confederate Army. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, and the war was officially over by June 1865. The Union Army's victory at Petersburg was a testament to their determination and perseverance, and it paved the way for the Reconstruction era that followed.
