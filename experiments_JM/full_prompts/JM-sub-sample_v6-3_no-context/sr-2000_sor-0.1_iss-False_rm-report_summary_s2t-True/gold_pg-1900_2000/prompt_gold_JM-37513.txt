You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author recounts their introduction to Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science, which began with reading Tyndall's Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination in 1870. This sparked their enthusiasm for the concept of evolution and the idea that the human mind and emotions could be explained by physical science. A friend of their father's, who was familiar with Spencer's work, suggested they read his essay "Progress: its Law and Cause" from 1857. 

In this essay, Spencer explains that progress is the evolution of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations. The author was drawn to this idea and saw it as a way to understand the universe and its many complexities. Spencer's philosophy emphasizes the importance of differentiation and integration in the natural world, from the development of the Earth to the evolution of society and human culture.

The author notes that Spencer's work was groundbreaking in its time and has had a lasting impact on the development of modern science and philosophy. His ideas about evolution, differentiation, and integration have been influential in fields such as biology, psychology, and sociology. However, some critics have argued that Spencer's emphasis on biological relationships led him to overlook other important factors, such as social and political developments.

Despite these criticisms, the author believes that Spencer's philosophy remains an important contribution to the understanding of the natural world and human society. His idea that every active force produces more than one change, and that every cause produces more than one effect, is seen as a key insight into the workings of the universe. The author also notes that Spencer's philosophy is not limited to the organic and superorganic, but rather is an all-inclusive interpretation that seeks to explain all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force.

Spencer's work has been widely praised by experts, including Charles Darwin and William James, who have noted the originality and importance of his ideas. The author concludes that Spencer's philosophy, as expressed in his Synthetic Philosophy, remains a significant and influential body of work that continues to shape our understanding of the world and our place in it. Overall, the author sees Spencer's philosophy as a major contribution to the development of modern science and philosophy, and believes that his ideas remain relevant and important today. 

The author also highlights Spencer's concept of the "unknowable" or the "ultimate reality" that lies beyond human understanding. According to Spencer, the universe is an insoluble problem, and the more we learn, the more we realize the limits of our knowledge. Despite this, Spencer's philosophy is ultimately optimistic, encouraging us to rejoice in the mystery of existence and to strive for a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it. 

In conclusion, the author's summary of Spencer's philosophy of science provides a comprehensive overview of his key ideas and their significance. It highlights the importance of differentiation, integration, and the concept of the "unknowable" in Spencer's work, and demonstrates the enduring influence of his ideas on modern science and philosophy.
