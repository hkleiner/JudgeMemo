You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their own journey into the teaching profession, which began as a temporary solution after college. Many of their peers viewed teaching as a "fill-in job" rather than a respectable career. The author shares the story of two young men who entered the teaching profession under similar circumstances. One man, who became a school superintendent, took a lackluster approach to his job, while the other man, who also became a superintendent, was dedicated and enthusiastic about his work.

The author notes that one man made teaching a job, while the other made it a profession. This difference in attitude and approach is crucial in determining success in the teaching profession. The author then discusses the process of getting a teaching position, emphasizing the importance of personality, preparation, and experience.

Boards of education typically evaluate applicants based on these three factors. A pleasing and forceful personality is essential for a teacher's success, and it should be cultivated to the greatest possible degree. The author recalls being inspired by a principal's attractive personality, which motivated them to complete their high school education.

In addition to personality, preparation is critical. A teacher should have a good general education and specialize in one or more subjects. However, specializing in a subject without a solid educational foundation can lead to failure. The author stresses the importance of broadening one's general education and never ceasing to learn.

When applying for teaching positions, candidates should be careful in filling out application blanks and provide responsible references. It is also essential to secure permission from references before using their names. The author advises applicants to be honest about their motivations and to seek opportunities for professional growth.

The author shares examples of candidates who have applied for positions, highlighting the differences in their approaches and attitudes. One candidate was primarily motivated by salary, while another was driven by a desire to specialize and improve their skills. The author concludes that a genuine passion for teaching and a commitment to professional growth are essential for success in the teaching profession.

Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of making a thoughtful and informed decision when entering the teaching profession. It is crucial to consider one's strengths, weaknesses, and motivations, as well as the needs of the students and the community. By doing so, individuals can set themselves up for success and make a positive impact in the lives of their students. The author's reflections and advice offer valuable insights for those considering a career in teaching.
