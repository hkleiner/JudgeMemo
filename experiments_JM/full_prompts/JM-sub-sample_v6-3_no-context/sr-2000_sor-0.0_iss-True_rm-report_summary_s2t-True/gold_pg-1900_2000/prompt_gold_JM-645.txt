You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator reflects on their early career, recalling when George Corvick asked for their help in writing a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for "The Middle" magazine. Corvick had to leave for Paris due to a family emergency, and the narrator saw this as an opportunity to make a name for themselves. They spent the night reading Vereker's novel and wrote a review, which was well-received by the magazine's office. However, Corvick was not satisfied with the review, feeling that it didn't capture the essence of Vereker's work.

The narrator had accepted an invitation to visit Bridges, where they would meet Vereker in person. They were excited to discuss their review with him, but Vereker didn't seem to have read it. The narrator tried to find ways to bring up the topic, but Vereker's affability and good humor made it difficult to broach the subject.

During a walk, the narrator found themselves beside Vereker and tried to initiate a conversation about the review. However, they were interrupted by one of the ladies in their party. Later, at tea, Lady Jane brought up the review and praised it, saying that the author had "got at" Vereker. Vereker himself seemed amused by the attention, but didn't comment on the review.

The narrator was pleased that Lady Jane had appreciated their work, but felt that their own reputation hadn't been greatly enhanced by the review. When they revealed themselves as the author, Lady Jane's reaction was muted, and the narrator wondered if they had diminished the review's impact by claiming ownership.

At dinner, the narrator watched for Vereker's reaction to the review, but Lady Jane didn't give them a chance to observe. However, when Miss Poyle, the vicar's sister, asked Vereker about the review, he dismissed it as "the usual twaddle." The narrator was taken aback by Vereker's response, but tried to laugh it off. Vereker added that the author didn't "see" anything, implying that the review had missed the point of his work.

The narrator was surprised by Vereker's reaction, but tried to maintain a neutral tone. They realized that Vereker's comment had been a clever way of dismissing the review without offending anyone. The narrator was left wondering what Vereker had meant by his comment, and what they had missed in their review. Despite the mixed reactions, the narrator felt that they had learned something from the experience, and that their encounter with Vereker had been a valuable one.

After writing the review, the narrator meets Vereker at Bridges, but is unsure if he has read the review, and is tempted to bring it up in conversation. However, he is discouraged from doing so by the presence of others, and later learns that Lady Jane has read and appreciated the review, which may help to introduce him to Vereker. The narrator is trying to navigate the complexities of literary criticism and social relationships, while also seeking to understand and appreciate Vereker's work.
