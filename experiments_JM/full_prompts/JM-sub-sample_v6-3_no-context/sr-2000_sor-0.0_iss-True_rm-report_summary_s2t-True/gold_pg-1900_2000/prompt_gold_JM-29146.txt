You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is working on the planet Irwadi. He is the only Earthman in the Interstellar Transfer Service on Irwadi. Ramsey is approached by a Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, who informs him that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all outworld ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet.

Ramsey is a big man with copper-colored hair and is rumored to have committed a crime on Earth. He is annoyed by the Irwadian's lisp and officious behavior. Chind Ramar explains that the planetarization is a result of the Irwadian government's desire to control the transfer of titanium, a vital metal found on Irwadi. The Irwadians plan to use their own pilots and ships to transport the metal, at a higher price.

Ramsey visits his friend Stu Englander, a fellow pilot who is struggling to make ends meet. Englander is sick and has a family to support, so Ramsey lends him some money. Ramsey then goes to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money. He is approached by a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who tells him to leave the table.

The Irwadian, who is wearing glittering jewelry and a weapons belt, accuses Ramsey of "thnooping" over his shoulder. Ramsey tries to defuse the situation, but the Irwadian is looking for trouble. The scene ends with the Irwadian telling Ramsey to get out of the gambling hall. The atmosphere is tense, and Ramsey is aware that he is the only Earthman in the hall, surrounded by outworlders who may not be sympathetic to his cause.

Ramsey's situation is precarious, and he is unsure of how he will support himself on Irwadi. He is forced to rely on his limited savings and may have to find alternative means of survival. The planetarization of the Irwadi Transfer Service has created a difficult situation for outworlders like Ramsey, who are no longer welcome on the planet. The Irwadians' desire for control and profit has led to a tense and potentially explosive situation.

Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when Englander gets back on his feet. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.
