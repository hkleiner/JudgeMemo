You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, noting that it has lost some of its magic. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, with secrets and surprises building up to the big day. However, as people grow older, they begin to see Christmas as a time of gluttony, indigestion, and expense. The author suggests that this change is not just a result of growing up, but also due to a shift in societal values and the influence of science and philosophy.

The author argues that the decay of the Christmas spirit is not just a subjective phenomenon, but a real change that has occurred over time. Children, who are often seen as the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, are actually conservative and traditional, and they take their cues from adults. The author suggests that the old Christmas hymns, which were written by devotees, are a testament to the fact that Christmas was once a deeply felt and meaningful holiday.

The author identifies the cause of the decline of the Christmas spirit as the rise of skepticism and doubt, particularly in the 19th century. The work of scientists and philosophers such as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, and Huxley led to a questioning of traditional beliefs and values. As a result, people began to lose faith in the idea of Christmas as a time of magic and wonder.

However, the author argues that this decline is not inevitable, and that people still have a deep-seated desire to believe in something. The Christmas spirit, which is based on principles of faith, goodwill, and charity, is still alive and well, even if it is not always visible. The author suggests that people are anxious to keep the Christmas spirit alive, not just for the sake of their children, but also for themselves.

Ultimately, the author argues that the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas, and that people know this deep down. The Christmas spirit is still a powerful force, and it continues to inspire and uplift people, even in the face of skepticism and doubt. The author concludes that Christmas is a time for reflection, gratitude, and celebration, and that it is up to individuals to keep the spirit of the holiday alive. 

The author's main point is that Christmas has changed over time, and that this change is not just a result of growing up, but also due to broader societal shifts. The author is nostalgic for the past, when Christmas was a more meaningful and magical holiday. However, the author also recognizes that the Christmas spirit is still alive, and that it can be revived and renewed through individual effort and commitment. 

The text is a commentary on the human condition, and the ways in which people respond to change and uncertainty. The author is concerned with the ways in which societal values and beliefs shape our experiences and perceptions, and with the ways in which individuals can work to preserve and promote the values and principles that are most important to them. 

Overall, the text is a thought-provoking and nuanced exploration of the meaning and significance of Christmas, and the ways in which it reflects and shapes our values and beliefs. The author's arguments are persuasive and well-supported, and the text is engaging and accessible to a wide range of readers. 

The author's use of language is descriptive and evocative, and the text is full of vivid imagery and memorable phrases. The author's tone is reflective and contemplative, and the text has a meditative quality that invites the reader to slow down and think deeply about the issues and themes that are being explored. 

In conclusion, the text is a rich and complex exploration of the meaning and significance of Christmas, and the ways in which it reflects and shapes our values and beliefs. The author's arguments are persuasive and well-supported, and the text is engaging and accessible to a wide range of readers. The author's use of language is descriptive and evocative, and the text is full of vivid imagery and memorable phrases.

Section section_02 (Chars 8278–12556):
Section Summary: The author believes that the true Christmas spirit has been lost among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who promoted an age of doubt and skepticism. This era of questioning led people to abandon their faith and ideals, lumping them together with alleged facts, and ultimately giving up on faith altogether. As a result, qualities like enthusiasm, spontaneity, and sentimentality are now undervalued, and people are left feeling lost and uncertain. Despite this, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, such as faith, goodwill, and charity, remain intact and essential for human dignity and survival. The Christmas spirit, though diminished, still lingers in people's hearts, and they instinctively try to keep it alive, especially in their children.
