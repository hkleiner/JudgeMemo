You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Bahá'í community addressed an open letter to the world's religious leaders in 2002, highlighting the need for organized religion to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of God and religion. The letter emphasized the importance of this principle in ensuring the continuing relevance of the great revealed faiths. The response to the letter was encouraging, with many recipients expressing distress over the failure of religious institutions to address spiritual and moral challenges.

The Bahá'í community has been working to promote interfaith understanding and contribute to the interfaith movement. However, the accelerating breakdown in social order calls for a more profound change in the way people relate to one another. Bahá'ís must draw on a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves and recognize the responsibility that comes with the gift of faith.

The period of history now opening is expected to be more receptive to efforts to spread Bahá'u'lláh's message. A sea change in human consciousness is underway, driven by the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise and the recognition that there is no credible replacement for religious belief in generating self-discipline and restoring commitment to moral behavior.

The twentieth century saw the rise of materialism, which led to the marginalization of spiritual forces and the disjunction between the inner and outer experiences of people. However, as the century closed, a groundswell of anxiety and discontent emerged, driven by a sense of spiritual emptiness. Ancient sectarian conflicts re-emerged, and scriptural themes and theological dogmas regained significance.

The world is now witnessing a widespread revival of spiritual search, with people seeking a personal identity that transcends the physical. This search is expressed in various pursuits, including the promotion of justice and international peace, environmentalism, and feminism. The reawakened interest in religion is far from reaching its peak, driven by historical forces that erode the certainty of material existence as ultimate reality.

The materialist enterprise has failed to deliver on its promises, leading to the collapse of totalitarian regimes and the recognition of the limitations of modernization schemes. The fate of social and economic development has left no doubt about the need for a new approach. The Bahá'í community is hopeful that its initiative may serve as a catalyst for a new understanding of religion's purpose and the promotion of interfaith understanding. 

The re-evaluation of material existence is driven by the recognition of its limitations and the search for a more profound understanding of human nature and society. The Bahá'í community is committed to contributing to this process, drawing on the insights of Bahá'u'lláh's writings and the scriptures of other faiths. The commentary "One Common Faith" reviews relevant passages from these sources, providing a framework for understanding the contemporary crisis and the role of religion in addressing it.

Ultimately, the goal is to promote a deeper understanding of the oneness of God and religion, and to recognize the responsibility that comes with this understanding. By working together, people of different faiths can contribute to the creation of a more just and peaceful world, where the spiritual and material aspects of human nature are in harmony. The Bahá'í community is committed to this goal, and is hopeful that its efforts will serve as a catalyst for a new era of interfaith understanding and cooperation.
