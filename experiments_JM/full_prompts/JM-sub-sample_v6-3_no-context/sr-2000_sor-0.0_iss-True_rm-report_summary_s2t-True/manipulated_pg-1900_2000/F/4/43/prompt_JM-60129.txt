You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, also known as the "golden tower." The team left the town and headed southeast, passing through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. They entered a sandy and sterile stretch of ground, which gradually rose to a low chain of hills. The only vegetation in sight was some insignificant creeping brush and reeds. 

As they journeyed on, they came across a village called Machuangtzu, inhabited by people who called themselves Sarö Yögur, or "yellow Yögurs." The Chinese referred to them as Huang Fantzu, meaning "yellow barbarians," to distinguish them from the Tangutans, who were called Hei Fantzu, or "black barbarians." The Sarö Yögur people claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache, which was located 45 days' march to the west or southwest.

According to legend, their forefathers had moved to their present dwelling places over a thousand years ago. Some of the tribe had settled in the mountains, while others remained on the plain. Those who settled near the city of Hsuchow had become amalgamated with the Chinese, while the others retained their language. The Sarö Yögur language resembled Khirgis and Turkish, but the people living further south spoke a different language that resembled Mongolian.

The team visited the temple at Machuangtzu, which was small and poor, and met the lamas who lived in the surrounding wooden huts. The lamas earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and they also educated boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of 13 horses to the Chinese government, which was collected by an officer stationed at Khunkeitzu.

The houses in Machuangtzu were fairly clean and built in Chinese style, with a traditional Chinese sleeping stove and a Buddhist altar. The people wore clothes made of home-spun material, cut in Chinese fashion, and decorated with coral and glass beads. The women's head dresses were peculiar, with long strips of cloth decorated with copper rings and metal ornaments.

The Sarö Yögur people had limited clothing and no holiday attire, and they only bought new clothes when the old ones were falling apart. They were busy with their daily activities, such as carrying water and tending to their cattle. The women wove cloth in long narrow strips, using primitive looms, and the men made baskets and knitted stockings using coarse stems of grass as needles.

The cloth woven by the women was of good quality and closely resembled the work of Khirgis women. It was sold in Hsuchow and Kanchow for a relatively low price. The Sarö Yögur people had no written language and no knowledge of their early history, wars, or princes. They had no old songs or legends, and their suspicious nature made it difficult for the team to gather information.

The team observed that the Sarö Yögur people had a unique culture, with a blend of Chinese and Mongolian influences. They had a simple way of life, with limited resources and no industrial activities. The visit to Machuangtzu provided valuable insights into the lives of this little-known ethnic group, and the team was able to gather information about their language, customs, and traditions.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, and left the Chinese town of Chint'a, heading southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team encountered a village called Machuangtzu, inhabited by people who called themselves Sarö Yögur, or "yellow Yögurs", who had a distinct culture and language. According to legend, the Sarö Yögur people originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and migrated to their current location to escape disease or other factors. The village had a small, poorly used temple, and the lamas who lived there earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, with minimal contributions from the villagers. The Sarö Yögur people had a unique language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but had no written language and were reluctant to share their history, songs, or legends with the expedition team.

Section section_02 (Chars 8356–12747):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style homes with Buddhist altars and heated sleeping stoves. Their household items and clothing are largely of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences, and are often made from home-spun materials. The women's traditional head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, coral, and copper rings, and are worn from marriage until death. The Sarö Yögur people have limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items during the cold season. They engage in some handicrafts, including weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men performing other tasks like basket-making.
