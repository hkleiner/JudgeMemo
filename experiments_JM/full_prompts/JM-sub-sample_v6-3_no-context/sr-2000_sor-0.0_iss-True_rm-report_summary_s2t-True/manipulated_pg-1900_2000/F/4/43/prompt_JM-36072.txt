You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change and transformation in England. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, brought about rapid changes in the country's economy, society, and politics. The French Revolution, which coincided with the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, helped to break the continuity between the old order and the new. The reign of Queen Victoria, which marked the latter half of the 19th century, was a period of readjustment and reform.

Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country, with a stable social order and a strong sense of national identity. The aristocracy held power and were highly cultivated, with a deep appreciation for literature and art. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent war with Napoleon caused a panic and led to a period of reaction and conservatism.

The war with Napoleon also kindled a sense of nationalism and patriotism in England, which led to a period of isolation from the rest of Europe. The country's intellectual life continued to thrive, with a notable output of great poetry and literature. However, the condition of the working class during this period was very bad, with widespread poverty, illiteracy, and squalor.

The government faced significant challenges in addressing the social and economic problems of the time, including over-population, poverty, and famine. The famous system of doles out of the rates, which was introduced in 1795, had the effect of pauperizing the rural laborer and putting an artificial premium on large families. It was not until much later that the country was able to produce enough food to feed its population, thanks to the new wheat fields of America and the sheep walks of Australia.

Despite these challenges, the first half of the 19th century saw significant progress in all measurable values, including education, liberty, and economic growth. The country's dominions beyond the seas were being peopled and consolidated, and the light taxes were raised with ease. However, this progress was not without its costs, and the country's social and economic problems continued to simmer just below the surface.

The Victorian Age was also marked by a sense of complacency and self-satisfaction, with many writers and thinkers of the time believing that progress was inevitable and that the country was destined for greatness. However, this complacency was not entirely justified, and the country's social and economic problems continued to pose significant challenges to its leaders and citizens.

In conclusion, the Victorian Age was a complex and multifaceted period in English history, marked by significant change, transformation, and progress. While the country faced many challenges and problems during this time, it also made significant strides in education, liberty, and economic growth, and laid the foundations for its future development and success. The period was also marked by a sense of nationalism and patriotism, which continues to shape English identity to this day. Overall, the Victorian Age was a time of great upheaval and transformation, which had a profound impact on the country and its people.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9120):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which had a profound impact on society and politics. The period saw a shift from a stable, prosperous, and contented England to one of rapid change and readjustment, with the emergence of new social problems and the need for reform. The aristocracy, who had previously held power, were highly cultivated and enlightened, but their influence began to wane with the loss of America and the French Revolution. The early 19th century was a time of isolation for England, with a strong national self-consciousness and a decline in sympathy with France, leading to a greater interest in German thought and culture. This period of rapid change and transformation laid the foundation for the modern era, earning the 19th century the nickname "the age of hope".

This progress was marked by a sense of complacency, with many writers and thinkers of the time celebrating the country's advancements and optimistic about its future.
