You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Joshua Reynolds was a man born with a natural talent for art, and his life's work was marked by a steadfast determination to succeed. He was not immune to doubt, but his temperament and common sense helped him achieve great things. Reynolds was not the greatest painter of his time, but he had a rare mixture of talent, industry, and judgment that enabled him to produce work with certain affinities to masterpieces.

Reynolds' early life was quite uneventful, born in 1723 in Devonshire, where his father was a schoolmaster. He was apprenticed to Thomas Hudson, a portrait painter, and later quarreled with his master, returning to Devonshire to paint under the patronage of Lord Edgcumbe. It was during this time that he met Commodore Keppel, who helped him see Italy and sparked his interest in the great masterpieces of art.

Reynolds' time in Italy was invaluable, where he studied and copied the works of the great masters, including Michelangelo, Ludovico Caracci, and Guido. He was particularly impressed by the Venetian school, and his work shows the influence of Titian, Tintoretto, and Rubens. Reynolds had a facility for taking the best from every artist and applying it to his own work.

When Reynolds returned to England in 1752, he opened a studio in St. Martin's Street and quickly gained success as a portrait painter. He later moved to Great Newport Street and then to Leicester Square, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Reynolds was a popular painter, and his prices increased as his reputation grew, but nobody seemed to mind paying him.

Reynolds was not just a talented painter, but also an accomplished man of the world. He chose his friends wisely, including Dr. Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, and their society served as a source of inspiration to him. However, Reynolds also had his weaknesses, including a touch of snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which he later learned to refine through his associations with distinguished people.

Despite his flaws, Reynolds was a great painter who produced work that has survived the test of time. His discourses to the Royal Academy, where he was the first president, show that he was a skilled teacher who knew how to inspire his students. Reynolds' legacy is not just his art, but also his influence on the development of the Royal Academy and the art world in general.

Reynolds' life was marked by both successes and failures, but he remained steadfast in his determination to succeed. He was a true artist, always seeking to improve his craft and push the boundaries of what was possible. Through his work and his legacy, Reynolds continues to inspire artists and art lovers to this day. His story is a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and a passion for art.
