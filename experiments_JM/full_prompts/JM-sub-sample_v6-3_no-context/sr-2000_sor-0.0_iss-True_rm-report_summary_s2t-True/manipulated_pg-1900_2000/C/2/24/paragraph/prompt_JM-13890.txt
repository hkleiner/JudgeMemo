You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 1538, a writ of summons was sent to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before King Henry VIII. The shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr was destroyed, and his name and memory were erased from records. However, this did not mark the end of pilgrimages to Canterbury. In the 20th century, a new enthusiasm for the site of the shrine emerged, and many people began to visit the city.

The old road to Canterbury, known as the Pilgrims' Way, passes through the beautiful hills of Surrey and Kent. Many modern pilgrims take the train, but those who walk the old road are rewarded with a gradual unfolding of the city's story. The first view of the Cathedral city is a highlight of the journey, with the city set amidst soft-swelling hills.

Canterbury's history began with the Romans, who called the city Durovernum. The Romans built roads, houses, and public buildings, and the city became an important center. After the Romans left, the Anglo-Saxons invaded, and the city was abandoned. The Saxons eventually rebuilt the city, calling it Cantwarabyrig, which meant the city of the men of Kent.

In 597, Augustine landed in Kent and began to preach Christianity to the Saxons. King Ethelbert was baptized, and the city became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England. The church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha worshipped, is believed to be one of the oldest churches in England. Some historians think it may have been built during the Roman occupation, while others believe it is a Saxon building.

Over time, Canterbury became an important center of Christianity, and it remains so to this day. The city has undergone many changes, but its association with the Church of England has endured. Even if the State Church were to cease to exist, the organization of the churches would likely continue to be centered in Canterbury.

The city's history is still being uncovered, and new discoveries may shed more light on its past. For now, Canterbury remains a place of great historical and spiritual significance, attracting pilgrims and visitors from around the world. The story of Canterbury is a rich and complex one, spanning centuries and empires. Despite the many changes it has undergone, the city remains a powerful symbol of faith and tradition.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8655):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who had been dead for 368 years, to appear and answer charges of treason. As a result, Becket's shrine was destroyed, and his name and memory were erased from records and landmarks. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. The city was later abandoned and rebuilt by the Anglo-Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent, and it eventually became a significant place in English history.

Section section_02 (Chars 8656–12872):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. Prior to 597, the Saxon capital was largely heathen, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard. In 597, Augustine arrived and was allowed to preach and instruct in Canterbury, leading to the conversion of Ethelbert and many Saxons to Christianity. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city's St. Martin's church, where Queen Bertha worshipped, is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, with its origins possibly dating back to the Roman or Saxon period.
