3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the author reflecting on the concept of World Fellowship, which they believe is a natural law that unites the hearts of women worldwide. The author dedicates the story to the women of America, sharing the life of their Chinese friend and teacher, Yen Kuei Ping. The story takes place on the Street of Precious Pearls, a side street in a Chinese town where women buy their dowry jewels. 

Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits the street with her grandmother, Madame Yen, and other relatives. They arrive at a shop with rich filigree carvings, where they are greeted by the owner, Wong Lui, and his attendants. The family is there to select pearls for Kuei Ping's dowry, as she is soon to be married. 

Madame Yen and Wong Lui engage in a game of bargaining, with each trying to outmaneuver the other. Kuei Ping is fascinated by the pearls and eventually selects a handful, which seem to glow with a warmer color when she holds them. The bargaining continues, with Wong Lui and Madame Yen exchanging cups of tea and polite conversation.

As Kuei Ping holds the pearls, she is suddenly transported back to her memories of the little mission school she attended. She recalls her graduation day and her admiration for a tall, golden-haired American girl, Miss Porter, who represented freedom and opportunity. Kuei Ping had been inspired by Miss Porter's words and had considered pursuing a life of service, but her family's plans for her marriage had already been set in motion.

Kuei Ping's family loves her, but she feels bound by the ties of tradition and family obligation. She is torn between her desire for freedom and her duty to her family. The conflict is difficult, but Kuei Ping has already made her decision. She will fulfill her family's plans and marry, rather than pursuing her own desires.

The story returns to the present, where Madame Yen and Wong Lui have finalized the purchase of the pearls. The family is bowed out of the shop, and Kuei Ping is left to ponder her decision. The narrative then abruptly shifts to a different time and place, introducing a new character, Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, who is destined to play a significant role in French history. However, this section seems unrelated to the main story of Kuei Ping and her family. 

Overall, the story explores the themes of tradition, family obligation, and personal desire, highlighting the challenges faced by women in a society governed by strict social norms. The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations, creating a sense of disjointedness and leaving some plot threads unresolved. Despite this, the story provides a glimpse into the life of a young Chinese woman and the cultural expectations that shape her decisions. 

The author's use of descriptive language and vivid imagery brings the Street of Precious Pearls to life, immersing the reader in the sights and sounds of the Chinese town. The characters are well-developed, with Madame Yen and Wong Lui emerging as skilled negotiators and Kuei Ping as a complex and conflicted young woman. The story raises important questions about the role of women in society and the tension between traditional expectations and personal aspirations. 

In conclusion, the story of Yen Kuei Ping and her family offers a nuanced exploration of the challenges faced by women in a traditional society. The narrative may be disjointed, but it provides a compelling glimpse into the life of a young Chinese woman and the cultural norms that shape her decisions. The themes of tradition, family obligation, and personal desire are timeless and universal, making the story relatable and thought-provoking.
