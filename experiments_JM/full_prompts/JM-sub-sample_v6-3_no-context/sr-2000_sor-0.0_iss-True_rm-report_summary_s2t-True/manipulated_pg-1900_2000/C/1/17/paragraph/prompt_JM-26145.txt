You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets in 1888 revealed a significant part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The tablets were found in Middle Egypt, near the village of Haggi Kandil, and were written in Babylonian cuneiform. The site of the discovery was the remains of the great city of Akhet-haten, built by Amenophis IV around 1380 B.C. The city was abandoned after the pharaoh's death, and its remains were well-preserved due to the sudden and violent downfall of the city.

The tablets were initially found by local farmers, who broke some of them into pieces to sell separately. However, the government intervened, and most of the tablets were secured and distributed to museums in Europe. The British Museum received around 80 of the best-preserved tablets, while the Berlin Museum received around 180, including many fragments.

The tablets provided valuable insights into the language and diplomacy of the time, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The tablets also contained notes in hieratic, written in red ink, and some were inscribed with the hieroglyphic names of King Amenophis IV and his father, Amenophis III.

Amenophis III and IV belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from the yoke of Asiatic invaders. King Thutmosis III had conquered Syria and extended Egypt's borders, but Amenophis III ceased the warlike spirit and focused on other pursuits, such as building and cultivating "wisdom." His son, Amenophis IV, introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, promoting the worship of the sun disk, Aten.

The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was built, and the royal court was moved from Thebes. The officials and courtiers adopted the new doctrine, and the king altered his throne name to Akhen-Aten. However, the foreign officials in Syria and Palestine were not informed about the change, and some continued to refer to the old god, Amon.

The condition of the working class in England during the earlier part of the last century was very bad, with poverty, illiteracy, and poor living conditions. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises. The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets provided a unique glimpse into the past, revealing the complexities of ancient Egyptian society and politics.

The tablets also highlighted the significance of the royal court and administration during the Tell el Amarna period. The king's reform of the Egyptian religion had a significant impact on the society, and the adoption of the new doctrine by the officials and courtiers reflected the changing times. The discovery of the tablets has been instrumental in understanding the history of ancient Egypt and the complexities of its society and politics.

In addition to the historical significance of the tablets, they also provide insights into the daily life and culture of ancient Egypt. The tablets contain information about the royal family, the administration, and the social hierarchy of the time. They also reveal the complexities of the relationships between Egypt and its neighboring countries, including Syria and Palestine.

Overall, the discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has been a significant archaeological find, providing valuable insights into the history and culture of ancient Egypt. The tablets have helped to shed light on the complexities of ancient Egyptian society and politics, and have provided a unique glimpse into the past.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8566):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets were found to be from the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from Asiatic invaders and expanded its kingdom into Asia and Nubia. Amenophis IV introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, moving towards monotheism and worship of the sun disk, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes. The discovery of the tablets has provided valuable insights into the history and administration of Ancient Egypt during this period.

Section section_02 (Chars 8567–12958):
Section Summary: The Egyptian king changed his name to "Akhen-Aten" and introduced a new religion, with his courtiers and family members also adopting names related to the sun god Aten. The new capital, "Akhet-Aten", was built and consecrated, and the queen-mother Teye showed respect to her son's new beliefs by visiting the city. In contrast, the working class in England during the early 19th century faced extreme poverty and hardship, with many being illiterate and inarticulate. The government struggled to address these issues, implementing flawed solutions such as the system of doles, which ultimately worsened the situation. Meanwhile, in Paris, a young girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was born, destined to play a significant role in French history.
