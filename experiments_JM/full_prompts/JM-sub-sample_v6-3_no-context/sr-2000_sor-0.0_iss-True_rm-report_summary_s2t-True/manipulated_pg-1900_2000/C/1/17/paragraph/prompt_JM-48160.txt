You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author is writing about her experiences in France during World War I. France is divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is restricted. The author wants to visit the war zone, specifically the front lines, but it's difficult to get permission. She tries to get help from various people, including Americans and members of the French bourgeoisie, but they are unable to assist her.

The author eventually meets a duchess who is able to help her. The duchess has established several hospitals and is on good terms with the Military Hospital Service Board. The author explains that she wants to visit the base hospitals to write about the conditions and promote a new organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, which provides delicacies to convalescent soldiers. The duchess introduces her to a secretary who agrees to help her get permission.

The author is given a carnet rouge, a special permit that allows her to travel to certain areas. She is initially told she can visit Rouen and Meaux, but she wants to go to Amiens, which is closer to the front lines. However, this is not possible due to the recent battle of the Somme. The author is offered alternative destinations, including Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, Révigny, and Bar-le-Duc.

The author decides to visit Bar-le-Duc, which is frequently shelled by German planes. She is warned about the dangers but is determined to see the conditions for herself. She travels to Bar-le-Duc and sees the damage caused by the shelling, including ruined buildings and cemeteries. The mayor of the town tells her about the experiences of the villagers during the shelling.

The author reflects on the contrast between the comfort and safety of Paris and the dangers and difficulties of the war zone. She notes that despite the war, the streets of Paris show little evidence of it, except for the presence of blind and legless men. The author travels to the Gare de l'Est, a major train station, which is crowded with soldiers. She observes the soldiers and officers, noting their height and healthy appearance.

The author is struck by the normalcy of the scene, despite the fact that the soldiers are heading to the front lines. She wonders if the whole front is on vacation, given the large number of soldiers traveling. The author's trip is a unique experience, and she is determined to make the most of it, despite the challenges and dangers. She is grateful for the help she received from the duchess and the secretary, which allowed her to visit the war zone and see the conditions for herself.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8205):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front, attempts to obtain permission through various influential people, including a duchess who helps her meet with a high-ranking official. After explaining her mission to publicize the work of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", an organization that provides aid to convalescent soldiers, she is granted a "carnet rouge" allowing her to visit certain base hospitals. However, her request to visit Amiens, which is close to the front lines, is denied due to the ongoing battle of the Somme. The author is instead offered permission to visit other locations, including Châlons-sur-Marne and Bar-le-Duc, which are also near the war zone.

Section section_02 (Chars 8206–11030):
Section Summary: The Mayor of a village described the intense shelling his village endured, with shells shrieking overhead for six days. The author then reflects on the idea that every idea or institution can provoke a violent reaction, citing historical examples such as Roman imperialism and the Catholic Church. The author, eager to experience the war firsthand, embarked on a trip to Bar-le-Duc and Châlons, despite having grown comfortable in Paris. Along the way, they observed crowded train stations filled with healthy and contented soldiers, and noted the physical stature of the French officers, who were predominantly tall. The author's journey was motivated by a desire to see and hear something beyond the comforts of Paris, after three months of relative calm.
