# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Veronese, born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, was a renowned painter known for his unique style and technique. He was described as the most absurd and adorable of great painters due to his disregard for logic and historical truth. Veronese's art was characterized by its riotous fantasy, naive self-confidence, and peculiar understanding of mythology and religion. He was a painter who prioritized beauty and joy over historical accuracy.

Veronese's father, Gabriele Caliari, was a sculptor who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. However, Veronese was drawn to painting and was apprenticed to his uncle, Antonio Badile, and later to Giovanni Carotto. He learned to draw by copying the engravings of Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden, which helped him develop his technical skills.

Veronese's early work was influenced by his boyhood friend, Battista Zelotti, with whom he collaborated on several projects. They worked together on the decoration of a palace in Tiene, where Veronese painted panels in grisaille. This collaboration had a significant impact on Veronese's style, which was marked by its use of color and composition.

In his early twenties, Veronese moved to Venice, a city that would have a profound impact on his art. He was dazzled by the city's beauty and opulence, and his color-enraptured eye was drawn to the white marble palaces, precious mosaics, and vibrant crowds. Veronese was also influenced by the works of other Venetian painters, including Giorgione, Carpaccio, and Titian.

Veronese's art was a reflection of his temperament, which was vigorous, jovial, and enamored of the bright side of life. He painted scenes of joy and luxury, often ignoring historical accuracy in favor of beauty and spectacle. His paintings were an exaltation of the joy of living, and he was particularly drawn to scenes of feasting, music, and revelry.

Despite his disregard for historical truth, Veronese's paintings are considered some of the greatest works of the Venetian school. He was a true original, and his art continues to be celebrated for its beauty, charm, and sense of joy. Veronese's legacy is a testament to the power of art to transcend time and circumstance, and his paintings remain a source of inspiration and delight to this day.

Veronese's time in Venice was marked by his fascination with the city's beauty and his desire to capture its essence on canvas. He was drawn to the city's vibrant colors, its stunning architecture, and its lively crowds. Veronese's paintings of Venice are a testament to his love for the city and its people.

In conclusion, Veronese was a unique and talented painter who left an indelible mark on the art world. His disregard for historical truth and his emphasis on beauty and joy have made his paintings some of the most beloved and enduring works of the Venetian school. Veronese's legacy continues to inspire and delight art lovers to this day, and his paintings remain a testament to the power of art to capture the essence of a time and place.
