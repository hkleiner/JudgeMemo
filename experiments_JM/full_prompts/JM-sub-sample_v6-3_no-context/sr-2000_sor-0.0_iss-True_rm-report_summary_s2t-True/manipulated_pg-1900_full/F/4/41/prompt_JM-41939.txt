    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a French painter born in 1822 to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a drawing master who struggled to make a living, and her mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician. Rosa's early life was marked by poverty and frequent moves, but she was surrounded by art and music from a young age. She began drawing and painting at the age of four and quickly developed a passion for art.

As a child, Rosa was raised in a bohemian household with her brothers, Auguste and Isidore. She was a tomboy and enjoyed playing with boys, which influenced her artistic style. Her father encouraged her talent, and she began taking lessons with him. However, she struggled in traditional schools and was eventually apprenticed to a dressmaker, which didn't work out.

Rosa's breakthrough came when her father allowed her to use his studio, and she began to develop her skills as an artist. She spent hours studying animals and making sketches, which became the foundation of her future work. In 1841, she submitted two pieces to the Salon, which were accepted, and she began to gain recognition as an artist.

Rosa's success grew steadily, and she became known for her paintings of animals, particularly horses and cattle. She was praised for her attention to detail and her ability to capture the movement and spirit of her subjects. In 1849, she sold one of her paintings to the state, which was a significant milestone in her career.

In the 1850s, Rosa's reputation continued to grow, and she became one of the most celebrated artists in France. She was awarded a medal at the Universal Exposition in 1855 and was hailed as a master of her craft. She continued to work tirelessly, producing numerous paintings and sculptures, and her studio became a menagerie of animals, which she used as models.

Rosa's personal life was marked by a deep friendship with Nathalie Micas, who became her companion and confidante. The two women lived together, and Nathalie managed Rosa's household and helped her with her work. Rosa never married and dedicated her life to her art.

In 1865, Rosa was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, which was a great honor for her. She continued to work and exhibit her art, but she began to feel the effects of aging and the loss of her beloved Nathalie, who died in 1889. Rosa was devastated by Nathalie's death and went into a period of mourning.

However, Rosa continued to work, and her art took on a new level of depth and emotion. She began to explore new techniques, including pastel painting, and produced some of her most beautiful works. In the 1890s, she met a young American artist, Anna Klumpke, who became her friend and companion.

Rosa Bonheur died on May 25, 1899, at the age of 77, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest animal painters of all time. Her funeral was attended by many prominent figures from the art world, and she was buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery. Rosa's art continues to be celebrated and admired today, and her story is an inspiration to artists and women around the world.
