You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8276):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a "carnet rouge" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber and impressive sight.

She traveled with Major C., Mme. Lyon, and their driver, Monsieur G. B., and visited hospitals to assess their needs and distribute supplies. Along the way, they encountered numerous checkpoints and were held up by sentinels, but the author was relieved to have no responsibility and let the men handle the paperwork and logistics. The trip took four days and covered a significant amount of ground, allowing the author to see the war zone up close and witness the massive mobilization of troops and equipment. Despite the chaos and destruction of war, the author noted that the roads were surprisingly well-maintained and the atmosphere was often calm, with soldiers and officers going about their daily business.

The narrator also describes the founding of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé," a French-American society aimed at providing comfort to wounded soldiers, which was established by a group of prominent women, including several Americans.

Section section_09 (Chars 66756–75164):
Section Summary: In French military hospitals, the dietary kitchen typically only offers milk and eggs, which can be a problem for patients who have a strong dislike for these foods. The military discipline is strict, and there is no exception for individual tastes, but a supplementary kitchen with donated delicacies such as broth, sugar, and preserves can make a big difference in the recovery of wounded soldiers. Mme. d'Haussonville's organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, provides these essential items to hospitals in the war zone, which can be a challenge due to the scarcity of food and supplies in the area. The presence of these delicacies can boost the morale and aid in the recovery of the patients, and donations from the public are crucial in supporting this effort. By providing these simple yet essential items, donors can help make a significant impact on the lives of wounded soldiers.

The author was struck by the gratitude and cheerfulness of the wounded French soldiers, who appreciated the small comforts and kindnesses shown to them. The wealthy in France, however, are no longer able to support the war effort as they once did, due to financial struggles and depleted incomes. The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the war effort, highlighting the importance of practical sympathy and generosity.
