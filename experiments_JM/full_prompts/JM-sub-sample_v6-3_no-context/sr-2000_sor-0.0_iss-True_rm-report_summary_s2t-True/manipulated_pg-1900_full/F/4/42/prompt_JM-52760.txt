# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various generals leading the Union's Army of the Potomac, none had succeeded in destroying the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capturing Richmond. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan came closest to success in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of Richmond.

In 1864, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given command of all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction to military operations. Grant's plan was to capture Richmond and Petersburg, and then march south to join forces with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman. The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast.

The Battle of the Wilderness marked the start of the final campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia. The Union army suffered heavy losses, but Grant continued to push forward, attempting to outflank the Confederate defenders. The Battle of Cold Harbor resulted in significant Union casualties, and Grant eventually decided to turn his attention to Petersburg.

Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub, with several railroads and roads connecting it to Richmond and the rest of the Confederacy. The city's defenses, known as the Dimmock Line, were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile-long chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. The Union army launched a series of attacks on Petersburg, but were initially repulsed.

In June 1864, Grant ordered the Army of the Potomac to cross the James River and invest Petersburg. The XVIII Corps, led by Maj. Gen. W. F. "Baldy" Smith, was the first to arrive on the scene, and they launched a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates were forced to withdraw, but the Union army was unable to break through the defenses.

The Union army continued to extend its siege lines around Petersburg, attempting to cut off the city's supply lines. In July 1864, they launched a series of attacks on the Weldon Railroad, which was a crucial supply line for the Confederacy. The Battle of the Crater, which took place on July 30, 1864, was a Union attempt to break through the Confederate defenses by digging a mine under the enemy lines.

The mine was detonated, creating a large crater, but the Union army was unable to capitalize on the opportunity. The Confederates rallied and launched a counterattack, which forced the Union army to retreat. The Battle of the Crater was a significant Union defeat, with over 4,000 casualties.

In August 1864, the Union army launched another attack on the Weldon Railroad, which was successful in capturing a portion of the railroad. The Confederates attempted to retake the railroad, but were unsuccessful. The Union army continued to extend its siege lines, attempting to cut off Petersburg and Richmond.

In September 1864, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm. The Confederates were forced to extend their lines, which made them more vulnerable to attack. In October 1864, the Union army launched another attack on the Boydton Plank Road, which was repulsed by the Confederates.

The winter of 1864-1865 was marked by a series of small skirmishes and raids, as both armies dug in for the long haul. In February 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Hatcher's Run. The Confederates were forced to extend their lines, which made them even more vulnerable to attack.

In March 1865, Grant launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Fort Stedman. The Confederates were able to repel the attack, but at significant cost. On April 1, 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate defenses, including the Battle of Five Forks. The Confederates were forced to retreat, and the Union army was able to cut off the last remaining supply line to Petersburg.

On April 2, 1865, the Union army launched a final attack on the Confederate defenses, which resulted in the fall of Petersburg. The Confederates retreated, and the Union army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, Lee's army surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, and the war was officially over by June 1865.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8196):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to ending the war, as it would likely lead to the abandonment of Richmond and deal a significant blow to the Confederacy.

Section section_02 (Chars 8197–16918):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, making it a vital supply point for the Confederate capital, Richmond. The city's defenses, known as the "Dimmock Line," were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates, led by General Beauregard, were initially outnumbered but received reinforcements from General Lee, and the battle continued for several days with intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces ultimately failed to break through the Confederate lines, and the battle became a prolonged siege of the city.

Section section_03 (Chars 16918–25441):
Section Summary: Grant's attempt to capture Petersburg failed, resulting in a loss of 10,000 men, but his efforts were not entirely wasted as two railroads and several roads were cut, and City Point was converted into a huge supply base. The Confederate defense line held, and the Union army was forced to settle for a siege, with 111,000 Union troops facing 47,000 to 51,000 Confederates. The Union army then attempted to encircle Petersburg, with a failed attempt to capture the Weldon Railroad, but this marked the beginning of a series of attempts to encircle the city. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including coal miners, devised a plan to dig a mine under the Confederate lines and blow it up, which became known as the Battle of the Crater. The Union army's plan was to reduce Petersburg through a process of attrition, which would last for 9 months, but some troops still hoped to take the city by direct assault.

Section section_04 (Chars 25441–34036):
Section Summary: The Union army's tunnel, which was 586 feet long, was completed on July 23 and charged with 8,000 pounds of black powder. The mine was detonated on July 30, killing or wounding at least 278 Confederate troops and creating a massive crater. The Union army's subsequent attack, led by three white divisions, was delayed and ultimately unsuccessful, as the Confederates rallied and poured artillery fire into the crater. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederates were able to regain control of the area, and the Union army suffered over 4,000 casualties, compared to around 1,500 for the Confederates. The battle was a significant defeat for the Union army, marking another failed attempt to breach the Confederate stronghold at Petersburg.

Section section_05 (Chars 34037–42721):
Section Summary: By the end of July 1864, Grant had a significant numerical advantage over Lee, with over 83,000 men to Lee's 22,000. Despite this, Lee's army remained potent and was able to maintain a defensive line around Petersburg and Richmond. Grant's strategy shifted to extending his siege lines and cutting off Lee's supply lines, starting with the capture of the Weldon Railroad in August. The Union army made further gains in late September and October, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm, which extended their lines west of the Weldon Railroad but failed to capture the Southside Railroad. The Confederates continued to resist, but each Union gain forced them to extend their defensive lines, making them thinner and more vulnerable to future attacks.

Section section_06 (Chars 42721–51110):
Section Summary: As winter approached, both Union and Confederate forces used the lull in large-scale battles to strengthen their positions and improve camp conditions around Petersburg. Despite being outnumbered and outsupplied, Confederate General Lee's army held a 35-mile front, but their situation was dire, with many soldiers undernourished and poorly equipped. The Union army, led by General Grant, continued to push west, attempting to encircle Petersburg, and in February 1865, they launched the Battle of Hatcher's Run, which resulted in a further extension of the Union lines. The campaign was marked by boredom, hardship, and disease, with both sides suffering, but the Confederates were particularly plagued by hunger and despair. Ultimately, the Union army's relentless pressure and superior numbers would lead to the eventual fall of Petersburg and the defeat of the Confederacy.

Section section_07 (Chars 51111–59941):
Section Summary: By mid-March 1865, the war was nearing its climax, with Lee's forces dwindling to 55,000, while Grant had over 150,000 troops at his disposal. Lee, facing a dire military situation, considered three options: negotiating peace terms, retreating to unite with Johnston, or attacking Grant to facilitate a retreat. He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union fort near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through the Union lines and allow for a retreat. The attack, led by General Gordon, initially succeeded in capturing the fort, but was ultimately repelled by Union forces, resulting in over 4,000 Confederate casualties. The failed attack left Lee with only one option: to retreat, as Grant was planning to launch a final assault on the Confederate lines.

Section section_08 (Chars 59942–68433):
Section Summary: The Union army, led by General Grant, concentrated its forces northeast of Hatcher's Run, threatening to encircle the Army of Northern Virginia. General Lee, awaiting supplies and passable roads, planned to join General Johnston, but the rapid accumulation of Union forces opposite his right flank posed a serious danger to his retreat and the Southside Railroad. The Union army launched a series of attacks, including the Battle of Five Forks, where they defeated the Confederates and cut off their supply lines, leading Lee to realize that Petersburg and Richmond must be evacuated. On April 2, 1865, the Union army launched a general assault on the Confederate earthworks, breaking through the lines and capturing key positions, including Fort Gregg. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond was imminent, and the Confederate government began to evacuate the capital, marking a significant turning point in the war.

Section Summary: The defense of Petersburg had been breached, and Confederate leaders knew that retaining the city and Richmond was no longer possible. On the evening of April 2, Lee's troops began a retreat from Petersburg, crossing the Appomattox River and heading towards Amelia Court House. The next morning, Union troops discovered that the Confederate earthworks had been abandoned, and they took possession of the city, with Richmond surrendering shortly after. The fall of Petersburg marked a significant turning point in the war, leading to the eventual surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox Court House on April 9 and the surrender of all Confederate forces by early June 1865. The Petersburg campaign had come at a heavy price, with over 42,000 Union casualties and more than 28,000 Confederate losses, but ultimately led to the defeat of the Confederacy.
