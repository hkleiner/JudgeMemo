    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author participated in a historic movement to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands. On July 23, 1901, a group of 499 trained men and women set sail from the US to the Philippines to implement this system. The journey took them through Honolulu, where they visited the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. After crossing the International Date Line, they lost a day and arrived in Manila on a Saturday morning.

Upon arrival, they were introduced to the local culture and customs. The city of Manila was a cosmopolitan mixture of people, with a blend of Spanish, American, Chinese, and Filipino influences. The author was assigned to the town of Bacalod, where they established a public school for boys and girls. The Filipinos were not strong advocates of co-education, so separate schools were started for boys and girls.

The author describes the daily life and customs of the Filipinos, including their love of social gatherings and celebrations, known as "bailes." They also describe the traditional Filipino dress and the importance of family and social status. The author notes that the Filipinos have a strong sense of community and respect for authority.

In contrast to the urban life of Manila, the author describes the quiet and peaceful life in the rural areas. The Filipinos in these areas live simple lives, farming and fishing to make a living. The author also visits a leper colony, where they are struck by the poverty and suffering of the people.

The author goes on a "hike" with a group of soldiers to pursue a band of ladrones (outlaws) who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening to attack a nearby town. They march through the mountains, following a rough and rocky trail, and eventually catch up with the ladrones, but they escape.

Throughout the book, the author reflects on the challenges and rewards of living and working in the Philippines. They note the difficulties of communicating with the locals, who speak little English, and the need to adapt to the local customs and way of life. Despite these challenges, the author is struck by the beauty and richness of the Filipino culture and the warmth and hospitality of the people. Overall, the book provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the Filipinos and the American teachers who came to the islands to establish a new system of education. The author's experiences and observations offer a unique perspective on the culture and customs of the Philippines during this period.
