# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. The Union Army, led by General Ulysses S. Grant, aimed to capture Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy. Grant's strategy involved a two-pronged attack, with General William T. Sherman leading the southern prong. The Union Army launched a series of battles, including the Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor, but failed to capture Richmond.

In June 1864, Grant turned his attention to Petersburg, ordering the Army of the Potomac to cross the James River and invest the city. The first Union forces to arrive were the XVIII Corps, which launched a fierce attack on the Confederate defenses, known as the Dimmock Line. Although the Union troops made initial gains, they were ultimately repelled, and the Confederates held their ground.

The Union Army continued to besiege Petersburg, with Grant ordering the construction of siege lines and the destruction of Confederate supply lines. In July 1864, Union troops attempted to capture the Weldon Railroad, a crucial supply line for the Confederacy. The Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road was fought, but the Confederates were able to repel the Union attack.

In an attempt to break the stalemate, Union troops dug a mine shaft under the Confederate lines, which was detonated on July 30, 1864, creating a massive crater. However, the subsequent Union attack was poorly coordinated, and the Confederates were able to regroup and repel the attack. The Battle of the Crater was a significant Union defeat, with over 4,000 casualties.

The Union Army continued to extend its siege lines around Petersburg, with Grant ordering the capture of the Weldon Railroad in August 1864. The Confederates launched a series of counterattacks, but were ultimately unable to retake the railroad. In September 1864, Union troops launched a series of attacks, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm, in an attempt to encircle Petersburg.

As the siege continued, conditions for both armies became increasingly difficult, with mud, disease, and hunger prevalent. The Confederates were particularly hard hit, with desertions and casualties mounting. In March 1865, General Lee launched a desperate attack on Fort Stedman, but was repelled with heavy losses.

The final Union assault on Petersburg began on April 1, 1865, with the Battle of Five Forks, which was a decisive Union victory. The Confederates were forced to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond, and the Union Army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War.

The Petersburg campaign was one of the longest and most brutal of the Civil War, with over 70,000 casualties. The Union Army's victory was due in large part to Grant's strategy of relentless attrition, which wore down the Confederate Army. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, and the surrender of General Lee's army marked the effective end of the Civil War.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8302):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals' attempts to capture Richmond, the war remained unresolved, with Confederate General Lee successfully defending the city. In 1864, Union General Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to lead the Union armies and devised a two-pronged attack, with General William T. Sherman targeting the Confederate Army of Tennessee and Grant focusing on Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Grant's campaign began with a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but ultimately shifted to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for Richmond. The siege of Petersburg marked a turning point in the war, as Grant's strategy aimed to isolate Richmond and wear down Lee's army, ultimately leading to the city's fall.

Section section_02 (Chars 8303–16946):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub for the Confederacy, with several roads and railroads connecting it to other important cities, including Richmond. The city's capture would have severely impacted the Confederacy's ability to supply its troops, making it a key target for Union forces. In June 1864, Union General Ulysses Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with his troops crossing the James River and approaching the city. The Confederate defenses, known as the Dimmock Line, were initially breached, but the defenders were able to regroup and establish a new line of defense, thwarting the Union's initial attempts to capture the city. The battle marked a significant shift in focus from Richmond to Petersburg, with the Union army ultimately failing to achieve a decisive breakthrough in the initial stages of the battle.

Section section_03 (Chars 16947–25736):
Section Summary: After the initial Union attack on Petersburg failed, General Grant's army continued to try to capture the city. From June 19 to July 9, the Union forces worked on consolidating their positions, disrupting Confederate supply lines, and planning a new attack. On June 22-24, a Union attempt to capture the Weldon Railroad was repelled by the Confederates, but the Union lines were extended across the Jerusalem Plank Road, cutting off its use to the city. The Union plan was to reduce Petersburg by a process of attrition, which would last for 9 months, but some troops were also working on a unique plan to take the city by direct assault, including digging a mine shaft under the Confederate lines. The 48th Regiment, Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteer Infantry, led by Lt. Col. Henry Pleasants, began digging the mine shaft on June 25, with the goal of blowing up the Confederate position and creating a gap in the enemy's line.

Section section_04 (Chars 25737–34092):
Section Summary: Union engineer Henry Pleasants successfully dug a 586-foot tunnel under the Confederate lines, using a ventilation system to supply fresh air to the diggers. The tunnel was completed on July 23, and on July 30, 8,000 pounds of black powder were detonated, killing or wounding at least 278 Confederate troops and destroying two guns. The explosion was followed by a Union charge, but the attack was delayed and disorganized, allowing the Confederates to rally and counterattack. Despite initial gains, the Union troops became mired in the crater, where they were subjected to heavy artillery and mortar fire, and were ultimately unable to break through the Confederate lines. The Confederate counterattack, led by Brig. Gen. William Mahone, ultimately repelled the Union assault and secured the area.

Section section_05 (Chars 34092–42731):
Section Summary: The Union army's failure to capture the Confederate stronghold at the crater led to a change in strategy, with Grant focusing on extending his siege lines around Petersburg and cutting off Lee's supply lines. The Union army then launched an attack on the Weldon Railroad, which was successfully captured, dealing a significant blow to the Confederates' ability to supply their troops. The loss of the railroad forced the Confederates to rely on alternative routes, which were eventually destroyed, leaving them with limited access to supplies. The Union army continued to advance, capturing key positions such as Fort Harrison and pushing the Confederate defense lines back. The relentless Union advance ultimately led to a thinner and more vulnerable Confederate defense line, putting pressure on Lee's army to hold out.

Section section_06 (Chars 42731–51277):
Section Summary: After the Battle of Peebles' Farm, Union troops focused on building forts and breastworks for about three weeks before moving again to target the Southside Railroad. On October 27, they turned towards the Boydton Plank Road and Hatcher's Run, but were met with heavy Confederate opposition and forced to withdraw. The Union army continued to push west, with the Battle of Hatcher's Run in February 1865 resulting in the extension of their lines, but ultimately failing to encircle Petersburg. The prolonged siege of Petersburg, which lasted for months, was marked by boredom, hunger, and hardship for soldiers on both sides, with the Confederates struggling with food shortages and the Union army dealing with the monotony of daily routine. The siege ultimately became the longest unbroken campaign against a single American city in US history.

Section section_07 (Chars 51278–59755):
Section Summary: The Petersburg campaign was a grim and challenging time for both Union and Confederate forces, with harsh weather conditions, disease, and homesickness taking a toll on the soldiers. By mid-March 1865, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's forces had dwindled to around 55,000, while Union General Ulysses S. Grant had over 150,000 troops at his disposal. In a last-ditch effort, Lee launched a desperate attack on Fort Stedman on March 25, 1865, which initially succeeded but ultimately failed as Union forces counterattacked and forced the Confederates to withdraw. The failure of this attack marked a turning point in the campaign, and Lee's forces were eventually forced to evacuate Petersburg on the night of April 2-3, 1865. The Union army then pursued the Confederates, ultimately leading to the end of the war.

Section Summary: The Confederate attempt to retake Fort Stedman failed, resulting in over 4,000 casualties and a restored Union line. Grant then planned to concentrate his efforts on the Confederate right flank, west of Hatcher's Run, and ordered troops to the area, including Sheridan's cavalry. The Union forces ultimately broke through the Confederate lines at Five Forks, capturing over 3,200 prisoners and setting the stage for the fall of Petersburg and Richmond. The Battle of Five Forks was a decisive victory for the Union, cutting off Lee's supply lines and making it difficult for him to escape. The Union army then launched a general assault on Petersburg, breaking through the Confederate earthworks and ultimately leading to the fall of the city on April 2, 1865.

Section section_09 (Chars 68645–73598):
Section Summary: The Southern position became desperate when Lee informed President Davis that Petersburg was about to fall, prompting the evacuation of Richmond. By midday, the Union army had captured most of the outer line to the west of Petersburg, and Lee's troops were forced to retreat to an inner line. The Confederates put up a stubborn defense, but ultimately, they were unable to hold back the Union advance, and Petersburg and Richmond were abandoned. The Union army took possession of the cities on April 3, and Grant set out in pursuit of Lee's army, which eventually surrendered at Appomattox Court House on April 9. The fall of Petersburg marked a significant turning point in the war, leading to the surrender of all Confederate forces by early June 1865.
