# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Summary: The text describes the author's expedition to the Sarö Yögur and Shera Yögur tribes in China. The author started their journey on December 13th, 1907, and traveled through the Gobi Desert, passing by the Chinese town of Chin-t'a. They visited the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met with the locals and observed their customs and way of life. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people who live in fixed abodes and engage in cattle herding. They have a simple and primitive lifestyle, with limited access to education and healthcare.

The author noted that the Sarö Yögurs have a unique costume, with men wearing coarse woolen stockings and Chinese shoes, while women wear a distinctive headdress with copper rings and bone buttons. The tribe has a small population, with only about 40 houses in the village, and they are governed by a pykh and his assistant yarkatshe. The author also observed that the Sarö Yögurs have a limited diet, consisting mainly of flour, cereals, and tea, with meat being a rare luxury.

The author then traveled to the Shera Yögur tribe, which is located in the mountains near the town of Kanchow. They were received by the t'umu, or hereditary governor, who was kind and hospitable. The Shera Yögurs have a similar lifestyle to the Sarö Yögurs, but they are more prosperous and have a more developed sense of community. The author observed that the Shera Yögurs have a strong sense of tradition and culture, with a rich history and customs.

The Shera Yögurs are governed by a system of t'umus, who are responsible for managing the tents and collecting taxes. The tribe has a complex system of social hierarchy, with different "bones" or clans, each with their own distinct customs and traditions. The author noted that the Shera Yögurs have a unique system of marriage, where the bride is bought by the groom, and the couple is expected to live together in the same tent.

The author also observed that the Shera Yögurs have a strong spiritual tradition, with a focus on Buddhism and the worship of various deities. They have a number of temples and monasteries, including the K'anglungssu monastery, which is the chief religious shrine of the tribe. The author was impressed by the beauty and tranquility of the monastery, which is surrounded by stunning natural scenery.

Overall, the author's expedition provided valuable insights into the culture and way of life of the Sarö Yögur and Shera Yögur tribes.

They encountered a number of interesting characters, including the t'umu, who was kind and hospitable, and the lamas, who were knowledgeable and spiritual. The author's experiences were marked by a sense of wonder and curiosity, as they encountered new and unfamiliar customs and traditions.

The text also provides some historical context, noting that the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs are remnants of a larger tribe that was once more numerous and powerful. The author suggests that the tribes have been influenced by Chinese culture and have adopted some Chinese customs and traditions. However, they have also maintained their unique cultural identity and continue to practice their traditional way of life.

In conclusion, the author's expedition to the Sarö Yögur and Shera Yögur tribes provides a fascinating glimpse into the culture and way of life of these unique and fascinating people.
