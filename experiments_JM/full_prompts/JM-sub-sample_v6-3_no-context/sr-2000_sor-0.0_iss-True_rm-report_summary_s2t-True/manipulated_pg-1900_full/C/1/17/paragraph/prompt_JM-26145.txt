# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reign of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The discovery revealed that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, as well as from Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch.

The letters provided insight into the political conditions of the time, including the struggles of the Egyptian government to maintain control over its Asiatic provinces. The provinces enjoyed self-government, but the disadvantages of this condition were evident in the numerous letters requesting aid from the king. The native princes and chiefs were constantly at odds with each other, and the immigration of Bedawin tribes added to the chaos.

The Egyptian court and administration during this period were marked by a shift in power dynamics. Pharaoh Amenophis III was more focused on building and cultivating "wisdom" than on war, while his son Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion centered on the worship of the sun disk, Aten. This led to a conflict with the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, resulting in the removal of the court to Tell el Amarna.

The letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani, revealed the complexities of diplomatic relations during this period. The kings sought to maintain alliances and trade relationships with Egypt, often through marriage and gift exchanges. However, the Egyptian pharaohs were reluctant to give away their daughters in marriage, and the relationships were often marked by tension and competition.

The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Aziru and Rib-Addi, provided insight into the struggles of the Egyptian government to maintain control over its provinces. The vassals often complained about the actions of their neighbors and requested aid from the king. The letters also revealed the complexities of the relationships between the vassals and the Egyptian government, including the use of diplomacy, trade, and military force.

The Tell el Amarna period was marked by significant political and social changes, including the rise of the Hittite empire and the decline of the Mitani kingdom. The period also saw the introduction of new religious ideas and the development of complex diplomatic relationships between the major powers of the time. The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has provided valuable insights into the history of the ancient Near East and the complexities of international relations during this period.

Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets offer a unique window into the politics, society, and culture of the ancient Near East during the 14th century B.C. The letters provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the complexities of international relations, diplomacy, and trade during this period, and have significantly expanded our knowledge of the history of the region.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8551):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to the Egyptian court and administration. The tablets also revealed the complex system of writing and diplomacy used by the ancient Egyptians and their counterparts in Asia, with scribes using various languages and scripts to communicate.

Section section_02 (Chars 8551–17327):
Section Summary: The life of King Amenophis IV, also known as Akhen-Aten, is not well understood, but it is believed that he intended to reform the Egyptian religion and reduce the power of the priests of Amon in Thebes. He introduced a new doctrine, known as the Aten dogma, which emphasized the worship of the sun disk and was considered heretical. The king's efforts led to a break with the old religion, and he established a new capital, Akhet-Aten, which was consecrated before it was even finished. The Asiatic provinces, which were under Egyptian supremacy, enjoyed self-government but were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute issues, and the immigration of Bedawìn tribes, leading to a state of perpetual unrest. The Egyptian government struggled to maintain control, and despite being well-informed, they often took inadequate measures to address the problems, leading to further instability.

Section section_03 (Chars 17328–25577):
Section Summary: The Egyptian king's power was being challenged by rebellions in Syria and Canaan, with local chiefs and officials defying his authority. Meanwhile, Akhenaten had taken some of his father's archives to his new capital, which included letters from foreign sovereigns, such as the Babylonian ruler Kadashman-Bel, who addressed the Pharaoh by his prenomen "Nimmuria". These letters reveal that the Egyptian king was reluctant to give away his daughters in marriage to foreign kings, and instead preferred to keep them within the royal family. King Tushratta of Mitani, on the other hand, formed an alliance with Egypt through marriage, sending his predecessors' daughters to the Pharaoh's harem, and later requesting gifts and promises from Nimmuria. The letters between these kings demonstrate the diplomatic relationships and negotiations between ancient kingdoms, with requests for gold, marriage alliances, and declarations of affection and brotherhood.

The relationships between these rulers are further complicated by the involvement of other kingdoms, including Babylonia and Assyria, and the exchange of gifts and messengers. Napkhuria's behavior is seen as inexperienced and reckless, leading to strained relations with other kingdoms. The section also mentions the first historic mention of the plague in a letter from a prince of Alashia, who writes about the devastating effects of the disease on his land.

Section Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets reveal the political conditions of the time, including the struggles of the Egyptian empire in Asia and the rise of the Habiri. The kingdom of Mitani, which was a significant power in Western Asia, was on the eve of its fall, threatened by the Hittites and Babylonians. The king of Mitani, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, rather than just for material gain. The Mitani kingdom eventually vanished, replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms, while Assyria seized its eastern boundary. The Egyptian XVIIIth Dynasty also faced a swift downfall, with the city of Tell el Amarna being razed to the ground after the death of King Napkhuria in 1370 B.C.
