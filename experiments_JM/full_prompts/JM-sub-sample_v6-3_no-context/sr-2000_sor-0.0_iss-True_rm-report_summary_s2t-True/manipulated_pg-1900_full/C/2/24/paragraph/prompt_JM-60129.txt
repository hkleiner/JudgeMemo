# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author embarked on an expedition to study the Sarö Yögur tribe in December 1907. They started from the Chinese town of Chin-t'a and traveled southeast, passing through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. The author met three women from the tribe, who wore a unique costume and were proud to identify themselves as Sarö Yögurs. The women were friendly, but the atmosphere changed when the author brought out a camera.

The author visited the village temple, where they met the lamas, who were initially cool but later became hospitable. The lamas were surprised by the author's intrusion, but they eventually opened up and shared information about their tribe. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people who live in fixed abodes and have a simple way of life. They have no written language and do not practice agriculture.

The author observed that the tribe's economic condition was low, and they had limited livestock. The men were responsible for herding cattle, while the women took care of domestic duties. The tribe had no musical instruments, and their only festive occasion was weddings. The author noted that the tribe's lack of energy and manliness was surprising, especially among the young men.

The author also visited the Shera Yögur tribe, who lived in the mountains. They were met with hospitality by the t'umu, who was the hereditary governor of the tribe. The Shera Yögurs had a more complex social structure, with a system of "bones" that determined relationships and marriage. The tribe was governed by a council of t'umus, who were responsible for collecting taxes and resolving disputes.

The author observed that the Shera Yögurs were skilled in weaving and making blankets, but they had no knowledge of medicine. They believed in a mixture of Buddhism and shamanism, and their religious practices were influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The tribe had a rich cultural heritage, with a unique costume and headgear. The author was impressed by the tribe's hospitality and friendliness, despite their limited resources and harsh living conditions.

The author spent several days with the Shera Yögurs, learning about their customs and way of life. They participated in a feast, where they were treated to traditional food and drink. The author was struck by the tribe's simplicity and contentment, despite their poverty. The Shera Yögurs were a nomadic people who lived in tents, which were less comfortable than those of other nomadic tribes.

The author noted that the tribe's livestock was of good quality, but they had limited resources and struggled to survive. The Shera Yögurs were skilled in herding cattle and had a deep understanding of the natural world. The author was impressed by the tribe's resilience and adaptability, despite the challenges they faced. The author's visit to the Shera Yögurs was a unique opportunity to learn about a little-known tribe and their way of life.

The author's expedition was cut short due to the lack of time and resources. They had to leave the Shera Yögurs and return to Kanchow, but they were grateful for the experience and the hospitality they received. The author reflected on the significance of their discovery and the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of the Sarö and Shera Yögur tribes. The author's account provides a unique insight into the lives of these little-known tribes and their struggles to survive in a harsh and rapidly changing world.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8390):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their language and culture showed similarities to Khirgis and Turkish, but they had no written language or recorded history.

Section Summary: The author bid farewell to their host and set out towards the village of Yench'i, intending to follow the high road to Kanchow and then visit the Shera Yögur Prince. Along the way, they observed the poor soil and coarse grass, as well as the lama Kuá's lack of endurance, which led them to believe that the Yögur tribe was on the decline. The author eventually arrived in Kanchow, where they obtained a letter of introduction to the Tangutan Prince and prepared for their visit to the Shera Yögurs. After a delay, they set out with a guide and traversed a challenging ravine, crossing icy rivers and navigating steep and rocky terrain. They finally arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, which was a impressive complex of buildings with a large, ornate temple.

Section Summary: The monastery of K'anglungssu is the chief religious shrine of the Shera Yögurs, with a large and wealthy temple that shows signs of Tibetan influence. The temple is decorated with Buddhist pictures, banners, and hundreds of small compartments containing images of Buddha, with a bronze statue of Tsunkoa as the central figure. The lamas living in the monastery are few, around 15, and are supported by voluntary contributions for their services as prayer-readers. The lamas are simple and poor, with limited knowledge of the Tangutan language and no involvement in medicine, instead relying on fortune-tellers to predict the future and pray for the sick. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and the t'umu, and departed for a return visit, taking in the pleasant scenery of the surrounding mountains and valleys.

The author then recounts their journey through the mountains, passing by various rivers and valleys, and eventually arriving at the residence of the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs. The t'umu's dwelling is a simple wooden house with minimal furnishings, and the author notes that the Shera Yögurs are a small tribe with only about 300 tents, governed by a system of hereditary leaders and traditional laws. The tribe has a complex history, with uncertain origins, but it is believed that they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects.

The tribe has dwindled in numbers due to death and intermarriage with the Chinese, and they are now divided into two groups: the Sarö and Shera Yögurs. The Shera Yögurs are further divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage rituals, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional practices. The tribe is led by a nominal head, Ta t'umu, but his authority is limited, and the settlement of taxes and other matters is handled by others.
