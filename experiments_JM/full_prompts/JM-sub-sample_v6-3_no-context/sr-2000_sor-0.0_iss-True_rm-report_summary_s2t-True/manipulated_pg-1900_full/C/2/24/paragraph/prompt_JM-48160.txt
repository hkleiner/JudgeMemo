You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The author was later allowed to travel to Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and observed the French soldiers on the train, noting their calm and composed demeanor. The soldiers seemed unemotional and businesslike, even when heading to the front lines, and the author attributed this to their "nerves of pure steel." Upon arriving in Châlons, the author was struck by the quiet and stillness of the town, and had to obtain permission to stay overnight from the local authorities. The author's credentials and letter from the Minister of War helped to ease the process, and they were eventually able to explore the town.

The narrator later visited the War Office and was promised a military automobile for a trip to Révigny, Nancy, and Remiramont, but only if she obtained a personal escort from an American Army officer. With the help of Mr. Beatty, she found an officer, Major C., and they set out on a four-day trip through the war zone, accompanied by a driver and a mechanician. Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, but the narrator was relieved to have no responsibility on the trip, leaving the work to the men.

Section section_06 (Chars 41319–49887):
Section Summary: The war zone in France was filled with soldiers, many of whom were not actively fighting but were instead waiting to be called to the front or were on leave.

The author also witnessed soldiers helping with the harvest in peaceful fields, and noted that the women and children were working hard to bring in the crops. The destruction caused by the war was evident in the ruined towns and villages, with the author arguing that these ruins should be left intact as a reminder of the horrors of war.

Section section_09 (Chars 66657–75113):
Section Summary: The writer describes their experience visiting military hospitals in the war zone and seeing the need for a supplementary kitchen to provide delicacies to wounded soldiers. Many soldiers have a strong dislike for the standard hospital diet of milk and eggs, and a more varied diet can help aid in their recovery. The French military discipline is strict, with hospital kitchens closing at 6 PM and not reopening until 7 AM, leaving soldiers brought in during this time without sustenance. A private kitchen, supplied by voluntary subscriptions, can provide essential items like broth, cocoa, and sugar to help nourish and comfort the wounded. The writer emphasizes the importance of this effort, which can help save lives and boost the morale of soldiers recovering from their injuries.

Section Summary: The author visited several military hospitals in France and was impressed by their cleanliness, organization, and care for the wounded soldiers. Despite some shortages, such as pillows, the hospitals were well-run and the patients were well-cared for, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the hospital wards and boost morale. The author met with Mlle. de Sézilles, the infirmière major, who showed her around the Hôpital Central and highlighted the importance of appetizing food and comfortable surroundings for the convalescent soldiers. The author also noted that the wealthy in France were not as able to support relief efforts as they once were, due to the economic strain of the war, and therefore relied on international support. The author appeals to readers to contribute to the relief efforts, emphasizing the gratitude of the French soldiers and the importance of supporting "The Eternal France".
