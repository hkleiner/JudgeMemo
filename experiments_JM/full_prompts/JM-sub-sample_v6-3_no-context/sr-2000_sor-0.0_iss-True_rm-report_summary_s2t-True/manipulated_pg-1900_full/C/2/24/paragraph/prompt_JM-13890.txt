# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. The Romans invaded Britain and established a settlement in Canterbury, which they called Durovernum. After the Romans left, the Anglo-Saxons took over and the city became an important center for trade and commerce. In 597, Augustine arrived in Canterbury and introduced Christianity to the city. The city's cathedral, which was built by the Normans, is one of the most famous landmarks in Canterbury.

The cathedral has a long and complex history, with various additions and renovations made over the centuries. The most significant event in the cathedral's history is the murder of Thomas Becket, who was archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 to 1170. Becket's murder led to a wave of pilgrims visiting the city, and the cathedral became a major pilgrimage site.

The city of Canterbury is still surrounded by its medieval walls, which date back to the 14th century. The walls are punctuated by several gates, including the West Gate, which is the only remaining gate from the medieval period. The city is also home to several other historic buildings, including St. Martin's Church, which is one of the oldest churches in England.

St. Martin's Church is a significant historical site, as it is believed to be the place where Queen Bertha, the wife of King Ethelbert, worshipped before the arrival of Augustine. The church has undergone several renovations over the centuries, but it still retains some of its original Saxon features. The city is also home to the remains of St. Augustine's Abbey, which was founded by Augustine in 597.

The abbey was an important center of learning and culture during the Middle Ages, and it played a significant role in the development of Christianity in England. The abbey was dissolved during the Reformation, and its buildings were used for various purposes, including as a palace and a brewery. In the 19th century, the abbey was restored and it is now home to a missionary college.

In addition to its historic buildings, Canterbury is also known for its picturesque streets and its vibrant cultural scene. The city is home to several museums, galleries, and festivals, which celebrate its rich history and cultural heritage. Visitors to the city can walk along the medieval walls, visit the cathedral and other historic buildings, and enjoy the city's many shops, restaurants, and cafes.

The city's history is also reflected in its many churches, including St. Dunstan's, which is one of the oldest churches in Canterbury. The church is home to the head of Sir Thomas More, which is preserved in a vault. The city is also home to several hospitals, including the Hospital of St. Nicholas, which was founded in the 12th century as a home for lepers.

Overall, Canterbury is a city with a rich and complex history, which is reflected in its many historic buildings, streets, and cultural attractions. The city is a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims, who come to visit the cathedral, the abbey, and other historic sites. The city's history and culture continue to inspire and fascinate people to this day, and it remains one of the most important and interesting cities in England.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8622):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Roman occupation, the city was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Anglo-Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral.

Section section_02 (Chars 8623–17257):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered attacks from the Danes, including a devastating raid in 1011, but it continued to grow and prosper, with the cathedral being rebuilt and the city remaining a key location for the Church of England.

Section section_03 (Chars 17258–25995):
Section Summary: After the Norman Conquest, a fire destroyed the Saxon cathedral in Canterbury, and Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, rebuilt it in the Norman style. The new cathedral, completed in 1077, was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Years later, in 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in the cathedral by four knights, an event that made Canterbury a famous resort for pilgrims. The murder occurred after a long struggle between Becket and King Henry II, and it was sparked by a confrontation between Becket and the four knights, who had been sent by the king. The cathedral, with its Norman architecture, became a significant site for pilgrims and a testament to the city's rich history.

Section section_04 (Chars 25996–34548):
Section Summary: Archbishop Thomas Becket's defiant response to the four knights who came to Canterbury sparked a violent confrontation, ultimately leading to his murder in the cathedral. The knights, fueled by fury and a desire for revenge, attacked and killed Becket with multiple sword strokes. Despite being a divisive figure in life, Becket was quickly revered as a saint and martyr, with his blood and relics believed to have healing properties. King Henry II, who had inadvertently provoked the murder, later performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and receiving physical punishment from bishops and monks to atone for his role in Becket's death. This act of penance was seen as a way for Henry to appease God and restore his reputation, and he believed it contributed to his subsequent military successes.

Section section_05 (Chars 34548–43307):
Section Summary: The murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket and the subsequent penance of King Henry II led to a surge in pilgrims visiting Canterbury, bringing wealth to the city and the cathedral. A fire in 1174 damaged the cathedral, and it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, which combined Romanesque and Gothic elements. The cathedral was further modified over the centuries, with additions such as the shrine of Becket and the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style. Canterbury became a major center of ecclesiastical power and a popular destination for pilgrims and royal visitors, but its decline began with the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of Becket's shrine. The city's historic architecture and rich history have been preserved, and it remains a significant and fascinating destination to this day.

The surrounding area was once home to the monks' cemetery, burial ground, and domestic offices, including the great hall, infirmary, and treasury. The precincts also feature the Green Court, a grassy space with a beautiful grouping of buildings, and the Prior's Gate, which leads to the Deanery and other historic structures. The Cathedral's interior, including the nave, is a masterpiece of ordered beauty, with a cool, greenish light and a sense of grandeur that contrasts with the smallness of everyday life.

The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, have undergone various transformations over the years, with some being used for debased purposes before being restored. The Abbey, founded by Augustine, was rescued in 1844 by Mr. Beresford Hope and is now a missionary college, incorporating some of the original structures.
