# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author embarked on an expedition to study the Sarö Yögur tribe in December 1907. They started from the Chinese town of Chin-t'a and traveled southeast, passing through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. The author met three women from the tribe, who wore a unique costume and spoke a language that resembled Khirgis and Turkish. The women were friendly, but the author's camera made them uncomfortable, and they soon left.

The author visited the village of Machuangtzu, where they met the lama Kuá, who was hospitable and talkative. The lama showed the author around the village and introduced them to the local customs and way of life. The Sarö Yögurs were found to be a pastoral people, living in fixed abodes and relying on cattle herding for their livelihood. They had a simple diet, consisting of flour, cereals, and tea, and their clothing was made from homespun material.

The author observed that the Sarö Yögurs had a lack of energy and manliness, and their village was poor and unclean. They had no musical instruments, no dancing, and very little singing. The author also noted that the tribe had a high mortality rate and a low birth rate, which was attributed to their poor living conditions and lack of medical care.

The author then traveled to the village of Kanchow, where they met the military mandarin Ma-t'idu, who provided them with a letter of introduction to the Shera Yögur tribe. The author traveled to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'anglungssu, where they met the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo, who was kind and hospitable. The Shera Yögurs were found to be a Mongolian tribe, living in the mountains and relying on cattle herding for their livelihood.

The author observed that the Shera Yögurs had a more complex social structure than the Sarö Yögurs, with a system of "bones" or clans, and a more developed system of governance. They also had a richer cultural heritage, with a strong tradition of Buddhism and a unique system of prayer and ritual. The author was impressed by the Shera Yögurs' hospitality and kindness, and they spent several days with the tribe, learning about their customs and way of life.

The author noted that the Shera Yögurs had a unique costume, consisting of a sheepskin coat and a hat made from stiff canvas. They also had a distinctive system of head-covering, with the women wearing a curved cylinder-shaped hat and the men wearing a Mongolian felt or fur cap. The author observed that the Shera Yögurs were skilled at weaving and making coarse blankets, but they had no home industry except for these activities.

The author spent New Year's Day with the Shera Yögurs, where they participated in rifle practice and a feast. They were impressed by the tribe's hospitality and kindness, and they left with a positive impression of the Shera Yögurs. The author then traveled to the town of Li-yen, where they met the friendly old mandarin, who provided them with a delicious dinner and a warm welcome. The author reflected on their experiences with the Sarö and Shera Yögur tribes, noting the similarities and differences between the two groups. Overall, the author's expedition provided valuable insights into the culture and way of life of these two unique tribes.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a legend that their forefathers came from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and they have retained their language and some of their customs. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language and culture, but their history and traditions are not well-documented, and the team was unable to gather much information about their past.

Section Summary: The author set out to visit the Shera Yögur Prince in the Nanshan mountains, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, who rode a small pony that kept pace with the author's larger horse. Along the way, they passed through a barren landscape with poor soil and coarse grass, and the author noted the lama's lack of endurance and energy. The author later prepared to visit the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'anglungssu, was delayed due to the late arrival of the escort, but they eventually arrived at the monastery, which was a collection of buildings with a large, colorful temple. The monastery was situated on the lower slopes of small hills, surrounded by grassy shores and slopes, and was the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs.

The author learned about the lamas' customs, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-tellers in times of illness. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and taking in the scenic beauty of the surrounding mountains and valleys.

The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage rituals, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional ways of life. The tribe's social structure and customs are still maintained, despite their declining numbers and influence from external factors.
