    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of the city.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–17132):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and sacked by the Danes, but it was later restored and continued to grow and prosper.

Section section_03 (Chars 17133–25886):
Section Summary: After the Norman Conquest, a fire destroyed the Saxon cathedral in Canterbury, and Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, rebuilt it in the Norman style. The new cathedral, completed in 1077, was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, who had returned from exile just a few days prior. The murder was carried out by four knights who had been sent by King Henry II, and it led to Canterbury becoming a major pilgrimage site in Europe. The events surrounding Becket's murder were marked by a dramatic and tense confrontation between the archbishop and the four knights, which ultimately ended in tragedy.

Section section_04 (Chars 25887–34521):
Section Summary: Archbishop Thomas Becket's defiance towards the four knights who came to Canterbury ultimately led to his murder in the cathedral. The knights, fueled by fury, killed Becket with multiple sword strokes, and despite the sacrilege, they found it easy to escape due to the divided loyalties of the people of Canterbury. Becket's body was found to have a hair-cloth shirt and a black cowled cloak underneath his outer robes, revealing his austere and monastic lifestyle, which contributed to his rapid canonization as St. Thomas of Canterbury. The murder and subsequent discovery of Becket's ascetic practices sparked a wave of devotion, with people seeking relics of his body and clothing, believing they had miracle-working properties. King Henry, who had inadvertently caused Becket's death, later performed a severe penance at Canterbury Cathedral, which he believed led to a military victory and ultimately contributed to the city's reputation as a major pilgrimage site.

Section Summary: The city of Canterbury was flooded with pilgrims every year, with people coming from all over to visit the Cathedral and pay homage to Thomas Becket.

Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the decline of the city, Canterbury remained an important center of the English Church and continued to attract visitors, including royal ones.

The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, have undergone various transformations over the years, with some being used for debased purposes before being restored. The Abbey, founded by Augustine, was rescued in 1844 by Mr. Beresford Hope and is now a missionary college, incorporating some of the original structures. Canterbury still has many other treasures to offer, including the Castle, old inns, churches, and museums, showcasing its rich history and architecture.
