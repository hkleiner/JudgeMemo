You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Bahá'í community addressed an open letter to the world's religious leaders in 2002, highlighting the need for organized religion to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the unity of God and religion. The letter emphasized the importance of this recognition in addressing the spiritual and moral challenges facing humanity. The response to the letter was encouraging, with many recipients expressing sincerity and concern over the failure of religious institutions to assist humanity.

The Bahá'í community believes that the time has come for religious leadership to face the implications of the truth that God is one and that religion is likewise one. This principle has the capacity to ensure the continuing relevance of the great revealed faiths. The community feels hopeful that their initiative may serve as a catalyst for new understanding of religion's purpose.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in religion and spirituality, with people seeking a personal identity that transcends the physical. This search is expressed in various ways, including a re-examination of people's sense of themselves and their purpose in life. The Bahá'í community sees this development as an opportunity for the spiritual search and personal experiences of individuals to take center stage.

The materialistic interpretation of reality that dominated the twentieth century has been eroded, and people are re-evaluating their values and beliefs. The bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise has led to a recognition that material existence is not the ultimate reality. The collapse of totalitarian regimes and the failure of social and economic development models have also contributed to this re-evaluation.

The Bahá'í community believes that the task of ensuring that the message of Bahá'u'lláh is engaged by people everywhere is one that has been laid primarily on the shoulders of those who have recognized Him. The community must draw on a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves and avail themselves of the spiritual resource provided by Bahá'u'lláh's writings.

The commentary "One Common Faith" has been prepared to review relevant passages from both the writings of Bahá'u'lláh and the scriptures of other faiths against the background of the contemporary crisis. The Bahá'í community commends it to the thoughtful study of its members. The community is confident that the period of history now opening will be far more receptive to efforts to spread Bahá'u'lláh's message than was the case in the past.

The reawakened interest in religion is far from having reached its peak, and the phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum. The most obvious cause of these re-evaluations has been the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise itself. The Bahá'í community sees this development as an opportunity for the spiritual search and personal experiences of individuals to take center stage.

The community believes that the time has come for humanity to recognize the unity of God and religion and to work towards a new understanding of religion's purpose. This requires a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves and a willingness to avail oneself of the spiritual resource provided by Bahá'u'lláh's writings. The Bahá'í community is hopeful that their initiative may serve as a catalyst for this new understanding and that the message of Bahá'u'lláh will be engaged by people everywhere.

Section section_02 (Chars 9774–14347):
Section Summary: The world is experiencing a resurgence of interest in religion and spirituality, driven in part by the recognition that religious belief is a key factor in promoting self-discipline and moral behavior. This spiritual search is manifesting in various ways, including a shift towards more personal and experiential forms of spirituality, as well as a growth in social movements focused on justice, peace, and environmentalism. The decline of materialism and the failure of ideologies that prioritized economic development above all else have contributed to this trend, as people seek a more meaningful and fulfilling way of life. As a result, traditional notions of reality and progress are being re-evaluated, and a more spiritual and values-based approach to life is emerging. This shift is expected to continue, driven by historical forces that are gathering momentum.
