You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, a small town in southern France. His father, a glovemaker, wanted him to follow in his footsteps, but Fragonard's passion was art. The town of Grasse was far removed from the artistic and cultural hub of Paris, where the latest fashions and trends were born. Fragonard grew up surrounded by the beauty of nature, which would later influence his art.

As a child, Fragonard heard rumors of the scandals and politics of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became the king's mistress. The Pompadour was a patron of the arts and encouraged the work of artists like François Boucher, who would later become Fragonard's mentor. Boucher's art was known for its elegance and charm, and he was a leading figure in the development of the Rococo style.

At the age of 16, Fragonard's father apprenticed him to a notary, but the young man's heart was not in it. He spent most of his time drawing and painting, and his mother eventually took him to Paris to pursue a career in art. In Paris, Fragonard's mother introduced him to Boucher, who was impressed by the young man's talent but felt he needed more training.

Boucher advised Fragonard to study with Jean-Siméon Chardin, a master of still-life painting. However, Fragonard made little progress under Chardin's tutelage and was eventually sent away. Undeterred, Fragonard continued to develop his skills, haunting the churches and museums of Paris and studying the works of the great masters.

After six months, Fragonard returned to Boucher's studio, where he was given a second chance. Boucher was impressed by Fragonard's progress and took him on as a pupil. Fragonard worked on large decorative cartoons and learned the techniques of painting and enlargement. This training served him well, and he eventually won the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art competition, at the age of 20.

Fragonard's win was a significant achievement, and it earned him a place in the king's school of art. He continued to work with Boucher and developed his own style, which was characterized by its elegance and charm. During this time, Fragonard created several notable works, including "Blind Man's Buff." Despite the turmoil and politics of the time, Fragonard's career was on the rise, and he was well on his way to becoming one of the most celebrated artists of his generation.

The French court was a complex and tumultuous place, with the king and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, wielding significant power and influence. The Pompadour was a patron of the arts, and her support helped to launch the careers of many young artists, including Fragonard. As Fragonard's career progressed, he would continue to navigate the complexities of the French court and the art world, always seeking to create beautiful and charming works of art.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–12969):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, impressed by the boy's potential but aware of his lack of skill, advised him to train with Chardin, a master of still-life painting. However, Fragonard made little progress under Chardin and was eventually sent away, after which he honed his skills by copying masterpieces from memory. He later returned to Boucher, who took him under his wing, and Fragonard went on to win the prestigious Prix de Rome at the age of 20. Under Boucher's guidance and later as a student at the king's school, Fragonard developed his skills and produced notable works, including "Blind Man's Buff".
