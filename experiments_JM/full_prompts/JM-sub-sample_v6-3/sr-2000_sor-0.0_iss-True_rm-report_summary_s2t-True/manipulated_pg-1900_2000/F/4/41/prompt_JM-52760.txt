You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting taking place in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals attempting to capture Richmond and defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, none had succeeded. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan had come closest to success in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of Richmond. The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the Union failing to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia.

The Confederacy had also failed to settle the issue, with attempted invasions of the North being turned back at Antietam and Gettysburg. However, in the West, the Union had made significant gains, capturing Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and opening up the gateway to Georgia. By 1864, the Northern armies were in a stronger position than the Confederate military forces, with greater resources and a distinct possibility of splitting the Southern states.

Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given responsibility for all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction, leaving the execution of operations to Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The Union plan called for a two-pronged attack, with Grant's army targeting Richmond and Petersburg, and Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army targeting Atlanta and the Confederate Army of Tennessee.

The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast, but was shut down by a numerically inferior Confederate force. The Army of the Potomac, led by Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles, including the Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor. Despite heavy losses, Grant decided to turn south and isolate Richmond by attacking Petersburg and cutting off its supply lines.

Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub, with several roads and railroads converging on the city. The city's defenses, known as the "Dimmock Line," were 10 miles long and protected all but the northern approaches. However, the line was vulnerable to attack, and the Confederates lacked the troops to defend it adequately. On June 15, 1864, the XVIII Corps of the Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. W. F. "Baldy" Smith, crossed the Appomattox River and approached Petersburg, with 18,000 Union soldiers facing less than 4,000 Confederates.

The Union forces were poised to attack Petersburg, with the goal of capturing the city and cutting off Richmond's supply lines. The Confederates, led by Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, were aware of the importance of defending Petersburg and were preparing to resist the Union attack. The battle for Petersburg was about to begin, with significant consequences for the outcome of the war. The city's capture would almost certainly lead to the abandonment of Richmond, and the Union was determined to take it. The stage was set for a prolonged and bloody siege, with the fate of the Confederacy hanging in the balance.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8192):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union forces had failed to defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of General Ulysses S. Grant, who launched a two-pronged attack on the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. Grant's army clashed with Lee's in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately failed to capture Richmond. The Union army then turned its attention to Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy, in an effort to isolate and capture the city, which would likely lead to the fall of Richmond.

Section section_02 (Chars 8193–12931):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the "Dimmock Line," was constructed, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line had weaknesses and required more troops to defend it than were available, making it vulnerable to attack. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, began to move towards Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps arriving on the scene on June 15, outnumbering the Confederate forces under General Beauregard.
