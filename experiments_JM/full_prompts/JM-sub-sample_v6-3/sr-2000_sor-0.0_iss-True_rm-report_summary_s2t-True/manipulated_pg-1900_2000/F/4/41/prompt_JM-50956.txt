You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" is written by Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, a Russian Army officer and military expert. The purpose of the pamphlet is to present Russia's role in the recent war. Russia made enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Prussian militarism, with 12,000,000 casualties, including 3,000,000 dead. The author argues that Russia's losses are more than twice those of France, four-five times those of England, and more than thirty-five times those of America.

Russia's role in the war was crucial, as it diverted the entire Austrian army and part of the German army, preventing them from realizing their plan to attack France. The Russian Army's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia helped to frustrate the German plan and contributed to the early termination of the second offensive in France. In 1915, Russia shouldered the whole burden of the struggle against Germany, Austria, and Turkey, giving the Allies the opportunity to prepare for the coming German offensive at Verdun.

In 1916, the Russian Army saved Italy from a critical moment when the Austrians threatened to cut off a considerable portion of the Italian Army. The Russian Army also facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme and was instrumental in the final clearing of the Verdun forts. The author notes that Russia entered the war unprepared, with the Russian Army consisting of millions, but bayonets and guns only for one-tenth of its number.

The pamphlet also discusses the question of whether Germany could have won the war. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the self-sacrifice of the unprepared Russian Army during the first days of the war played an enormous role in preventing Germany from winning. The Russian Army's attack on East Prussia destroyed the German plan to concentrate all forces against France, and the plan collapsed.

The author also criticizes General Ludendorff's memoirs, which attempt to slander the Russian Army and discredit its sacrifices and heroic efforts. The memoirs are misleading, especially in the part describing the first Russian advance in East Prussia, which played a decisive role in the defeat of the Germans on the Marne. The author argues that Russia's historic role in the war is becoming obscured, and it is essential to recognize the true significance of Russia's contributions to the Allied cause.

The Russian Army's efforts during the first three years of the war were crucial, as they sapped the resources of the enemy and made it possible for the Allies to deliver the final blow. The author concludes that Russia's role in the war was gigantic, and its sacrifices were consecrated to the common cause of the Allies. The pamphlet aims to set the record straight and provide a accurate account of Russia's part in the world war. Overall, the pamphlet highlights the importance of Russia's contributions to the Allied victory and argues that its role should not be forgotten or obscured.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8573):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and efforts were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan, led by Field Marshal Moltke, was close to succeeding due to Russia's initial unpreparedness. The Russian Army's bravery and heroism, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, helped to save the situation at critical moments, including the battles of Galicia, Warsaw, and East Prussia. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was instrumental in the Allied victory, and its contributions should not be underestimated.

Section section_02 (Chars 8574–13144):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, aimed to concentrate all forces against France, but this plan was foiled when Russia unexpectedly rushed into East Prussia, diverting German troops from the French front. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and lost them their only chance at a decisive victory. Despite being unprepared, Russia's early involvement in the war played a crucial role in the Allied cause, bearing the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's historic role in the war is being obscured by later events and distorted by biased accounts, such as General Ludendorff's memoirs, which attempt to slander the Russian Army. Russia's sacrifices and contributions to the war effort are often overlooked, despite being a key factor in the ultimate defeat of Germany.
