You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, taking a tram to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs. They want to buy a dog, but not an expensive one with a pedigree. The conductor on the tram teases them about getting off at the "Home for Lost Dawgs." When they arrive in Battersea, they try to find the dog's home but get lost. 

A street boy gives them a misleading direction, telling them to "bite a policeman" to get there quickly. The narrator and Stella then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem on his hat. They decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to the dog's home.

However, their attempt at stealthy surveillance is unsuccessful, and they end up chasing the man through the streets. The man becomes frightened and tries to lose them, but they continue to follow him. Eventually, he leads them to a cul-de-sac, where he enters a villa, leaving them guideless and dogless.

The man and his wife appear at the window, glare at the narrator and Stella, and then close the curtains. The narrator and Stella are left feeling exhausted and discomfited. They decide to go home, and Stella is bitter about their failed attempt to find the dog's home. 

On their way home, Stella mentions that they have saved five shillings by not buying a dog, but the narrator reminds her that they spent half a crown on a taxi to get back to the station. Stella is too tired and frustrated to argue, and the narrator suggests advertising for a dog instead. However, Stella is put off the idea of getting a dog after their disappointing experience.

As they walk home across the golf course, Stella suddenly grabs the narrator's arm and points to something. The narrator is unsure what she has seen, but it seems to have startled her. The story ends with the narrator trying to reassure Stella that she is just tired and shaken from their eventful day.
