You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the little Scotch cousins to their American counterparts. The author notes that despite differences, the Scotch and Americans share a common bond, particularly in their love for Scottish legends and stories. The preface sets the stage for a heartwarming tale of friendship and adventure.

The story starts with Donald, a young boy, finding a little puppy in a lane near his home. He brings the puppy to his friend Sandy, and they both are excited about the new addition. Donald takes the puppy to his home, where his parents, Doctor and Mrs. Gordon, welcome the little dog. The family decides to care for the puppy until its owner is found.

As they enjoy their afternoon tea, the family discusses the puppy's future. Donald is eager to keep the puppy and train it to be a sheepdog. His father, Doctor Gordon, suggests that they advertise the puppy in the paper to find its owner. If no one claims the puppy, Donald can keep it.

The family is delighted with the puppy's antics, and they all pitch in to care for it. Mrs. Gordon makes a special effort to feed the puppy, and it quickly becomes a part of the family. As the days pass, Donald grows more attached to the puppy, and the family starts to think of names for it.

Meanwhile, the family receives news that their cousins, Janet and Marjorie Lindsay, are coming to visit. The boys are excited to show their cousins around and have fun together. They also learn that their Uncle Alan, a wealthy and adventurous man, has invited them to visit his estate in the Highlands.

As the days go by, Donald becomes more confident that the puppy will stay with the family. The doctor eventually suggests that it's time to give the puppy a name. After some discussion, Donald decides to name the puppy "Rob Roy" after the hero of his favorite story. The name is later shortened to Rob.

The story is a charming tale of friendship, family, and adventure, set against the beautiful backdrop of Scotland. The characters are well-developed and relatable, making the story enjoyable to read.
