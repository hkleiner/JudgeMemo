You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" is written by Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, a Russian Army officer and military expert. The purpose of the pamphlet is to present Russia's role in the recent war. Russia made enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Prussian militarism, with 12,000,000 casualties, including 3,000,000 dead. The author argues that Russia's losses are more than twice those of France, four-five times those of England, and more than thirty-five times those of America.

Russia's role in the war was crucial, as it diverted the entire Austrian army and part of the German army, preventing them from realizing their plan to attack France. The Russian Army's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia helped to frustrate the German plan and contributed to the early termination of the second offensive in France. In 1915, Russia shouldered the whole burden of the struggle against Germany, Austria, and Turkey, giving the Allies time to prepare for the coming German offensive at Verdun.

In 1916, the Russian Army saved Italy from a critical situation and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme. The author notes that Russia's losses were not only in human lives but also in economic terms, with the country's economic life becoming overstrained and partially destroyed. The Russian Army's efforts were instrumental in weakening the enemy and making it possible for the Allies to deliver the final blow.

The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but Russia's self-sacrifice and efforts prevented it from happening. The plan of Field Marshal Moltke was to concentrate all forces against France, but Russia's unprepared army rushed into East Prussia, diverting German forces and destroying the plan. The author regrets that the true historic role of Russia in the war is being obscured by the extraordinary conditions that developed in Russia towards the end of the war.

The pamphlet also criticizes General Ludendorf's memoirs, which attempt to slander the Russian Army and discredit its sacrifices. The author argues that Ludendorf's memoirs are misleading and use false data to distort the historic perspective of the war. The Russian Army's role in the war was significant, and its efforts should be recognized as a crucial factor in the Allied victory.

The author concludes that Russia's participation in the war should be gauged not only by its losses but also by its efforts to blast the German war plans and save critical situations. The Russian Army's campaign against Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey weakened the enemy and made it possible for the Allies to win the war. The pamphlet aims to set the record straight and recognize Russia's historic role in the war. Overall, the pamphlet provides a detailed account of Russia's role in the war and argues that its efforts were instrumental in the Allied victory.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8721):
Section Summary: Russia played a crucial role in World War I, suffering enormous sacrifices, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and over 30 times those of the United States. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, diverting enemy forces and giving the Allies time to prepare and counterattack. Russia's efforts weakened the enemy's resources, making it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat them. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Russia's contributions to the war effort were significant, and its sacrifices paved the way for the Allied victory.

Section section_02 (Chars 8721–13137):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, relied on concentrating all forces against France, but this was thwarted when Russia unexpectedly attacked East Prussia, diverting German troops. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and gave France a crucial advantage, ultimately changing the course of the war. Russia's early efforts played a significant role in the war, as they bore the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's contributions are often overlooked due to the circumstances that developed towards the end of the war. General Ludendorf's memoirs have also contributed to this oversight, as they attempt to discredit Russia's sacrifices and distort the historic perspective of the war.
