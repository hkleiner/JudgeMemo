You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and hyper-space pilot, is on the planet Irwadi, where he works for the Interstellar Transfer Service. He is approached by a Port Security Officer, who informs him that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Transfer Service, effectively taking control of it. The officer asks Ramsey to surrender his pilot's license, which he does. Ramsey is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet.

Ramsey goes to the Polaris, a Centaurian ship he was supposed to pilot, and retrieves his gear. He then visits his friend Stu Englander, a fellow pilot who is currently unable to work due to a bronchial condition. Ramsey lends Englander some money to help support his family. Englander is grateful, but Ramsey tells him not to worry about paying him back.

Ramsey then goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, where he loses most of his money. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian approaches him, telling him to leave because he doesn't want any Earthmen watching him gamble. The Irwadian is hostile and accuses Earthmen of bringing poverty, disease, and trouble to Irwadi.

The situation becomes tense, and the other patrons of the gambling hall fall silent. Ramsey looks around and notices that he is the only Earthman present. The Irwadian's behavior is likely a result of the frenzy of planetarization, which has led to irrational behavior among the native population.

The planetarization of the Transfer Service is a significant event, as Irwadi is an important planet-of-call in the Galactic Federation due to its abundance of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships. The Irwadian government's decision to take control of the Transfer Service will likely have far-reaching consequences for the galaxy.

Ramsey's situation is precarious, as he is now without a job or a way to support himself. He will have to find a way to survive on Irwadi until he can be removed from the planet. The Irwadian government's actions have created a difficult and uncertain environment for outworlders like Ramsey.

The story also touches on the theme of prejudice and hostility towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. The Irwadian's behavior towards Ramsey is a clear example of this, and it is likely that Ramsey will face similar challenges as he tries to navigate his new situation on Irwadi.

Overall, the story sets the stage for a complex and potentially conflict-filled narrative, as Ramsey and other outworlders try to cope with the consequences of the Irwadian government's actions. The planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a power vacuum, and it is unclear how the situation will unfold.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8099):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is temporarily grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot license. The Irwadian government's move is seen as a power play to control the supply of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially, and offers to help him out with some credits. The situation on Irwadi is dire for non-Irwadian pilots like Ramsey and Englander, who must find a way to leave the planet and pursue other opportunities in the galaxy.
