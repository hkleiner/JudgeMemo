You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is questioned by a Port Security Officer on the planet Irwadi. The officer, Chind Ramar, informs Ramsey that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is shocked and skeptical, knowing that transferring a starship through hyper-space is a difficult task that few Irwadians have mastered.

Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He visits his friend Stu Englander, another hyper-space pilot, who is struggling to make ends meet due to his bronchial condition. Ramsey lends Englander some money to help support his family.

Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, where he loses most of his money. He is approached by a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who accuses him of "snooping" and tells him to leave. The Irwadian is hostile and aggressive, reflecting the anti-outworlder sentiment that has been growing on Irwadi.

The planetarization of the Transfer Service has stranded many outworlders on Irwadi, and tensions are running high. Ramsey is aware that the Irwadians are trying to assert their dominance and control over the planet's resources, particularly titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel.

As the night wears on, Ramsey becomes increasingly aware of the difficulties and dangers faced by outworlders on Irwadi. He knows that he will have to be careful to avoid trouble and find a way to survive until he can escape the planet. The Irwadian government's actions have created a sense of uncertainty and fear among the outworlder community, and Ramsey is determined to find a way to overcome the challenges ahead.

The story highlights the tensions and conflicts between outworlders and Irwadians, as well as the difficulties faced by hyper-space pilots who are stranded on the planet. The planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a sense of crisis and uncertainty, and Ramsey must navigate this complex and hostile environment to survive.

Ramsey's experiences on Irwadi are shaped by the planet's harsh climate and the Irwadians' cultural and social norms. The Irwadians' decision to strip down and wear no clothing is seen as a way to prove their toughness and resilience in the face of the freezing climate. However, this also reflects their hostility and aggression towards outworlders.

The story raises questions about the consequences of the Irwadian government's actions and the impact on the outworlder community. How will Ramsey and other outworlders survive on a planet that is increasingly hostile to them? What will happen to the Interstellar Transfer Service, and how will the galaxy respond to the Irwadian government's actions? The story sets the stage for a complex and suspenseful exploration of these questions.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8003):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government has taken this step to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships, and will only allow Irwadian pilots to transport it. Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene, and he has a few hundred credits to tide him over. The move is expected to give Irwadi control over the titanium trade and allow them to set their own prices.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16069):
Section Summary: Chind Ramar, the Irwadi Security Officer, has ordered the crew and passengers of the Polaris to assemble, announcing that the planet has been "planetarized" and all outworld ships are stranded indefinitely. This means that only Irwadian pilots will be allowed to transport titanium, a vital metal, through hyper-space, giving Irwadi control over the market. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is among those affected and has surrendered his pilot license, but he's not too concerned as he has some savings to tide him over. An Earthgirl, who has the ability to read minds, has also left the ship and is heading to the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, trying not to panic. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially and worried about supporting his family, and they discuss their uncertain futures on the planet.

A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, wearing flashy jewelry, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent.
