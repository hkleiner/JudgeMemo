You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians. According to legend, the city was founded by twin brothers, Natchitoches and Nacogdoches, who were the sons of a Caddo chief. The brothers were instructed to travel in opposite directions and establish their own tribes, with Nacogdoches founding the tribe that would become the Tejas Indians. The Tejas Indians lived in the area for centuries, building comfortable homes and ceremonial mounds.

The first European to visit the area was Hernando De Soto, who spent the winter of 1541-42 in Nacogdoches. Later, in 1620, a Christian missionary taught the Tejas Indians about Christianity. In 1685, Robert Sieur de LaSalle visited the area and received hospitable treatment from the natives. The French and Spanish both had contact with the Tejas Indians, and the city became an important stop for traders and travelers.

The first permanent European settlement in Nacogdoches was established in 1716 by Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus, who founded the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches. The mission was eventually abandoned, but the city continued to grow and became an important center for trade and commerce. In 1764, the French ceded Louisiana to Spain, and the city became a Spanish town.

In 1779, Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo refounded the city and established the Old Stone Fort, which served as a commissary and a place of refuge. The city grew rapidly, and by the beginning of the 19th century, it had a population of several hundred people. In 1800, the city was involved in the suppression of an expedition led by Philip Nolan, who was attempting to invade Texas.

Nolan was killed, and his followers were captured and imprisoned in the Old Stone Fort. The city continued to play an important role in the history of Texas, and it remains a significant cultural and historical center to this day. The Old Stone Fort is still standing and serves as a museum and a reminder of the city's rich history. The city's history is also preserved in the Nacogdoches Archives, which contain important documents and records from the city's past.

The Tejas Indians were skilled farmers and hunters, and they built ceremonial mounds that still exist today. The city's early history is also marked by the presence of notable figures such as Red Feather, who taught the Tejas Indians about agriculture and husbandry. The city's location made it an important stop for traders and travelers, and it played a significant role in the development of the region.

Overall, the city of Nacogdoches has a rich and complex history that reflects the interactions and influences of different cultures and empires. From its founding by the Tejas Indians to its current status as a thriving city, Nacogdoches has played an important role in the history of Texas and the region. The city's history is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people, and it continues to be an important part of the city's identity and culture.

Section Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians, who settled in the area and built homes around ceremonial mounds. According to legend, the city was founded by Nacogdoches, a twin son of a Caddo chief, who was instructed to travel towards the setting sun and establish a home. The area was later visited by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle, who found a well-settled and hospitable Indian town. The first permanent European settlement was established in 1716 with the founding of the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches, and the city was later refounded by Spanish settlers in 1779. Over time, the city has evolved from an Indian town to a Spanish town, with a complex history shaped by the interactions of Native Americans, Europeans, and other cultures.

Section Summary: In the late 18th century, Gil Ybarbo, a Spanish leader, established a settlement in Nacogdoches, Texas, and built a stone house, known as the Old Stone Fort, which served as a center for commerce and a place of refuge. Ybarbo was eventually removed from his position due to irregularities and was replaced by a succession of officials. In 1800, the town of Nacogdoches remained loyal to Spain and played a role in suppressing an expedition led by Philip Nolan, who was secretly working with American leaders to invade Texas. Nolan was killed, and his followers were captured and imprisoned in the Old Stone Fort before being taken to Mexico. The incident highlighted the tensions and rivalries between Spain and the United States, which would continue to shape the region's history.
