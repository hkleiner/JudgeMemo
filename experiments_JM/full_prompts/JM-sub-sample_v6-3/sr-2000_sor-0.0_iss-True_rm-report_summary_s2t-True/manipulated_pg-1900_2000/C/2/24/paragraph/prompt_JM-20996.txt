You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author of the book participated in a historic movement that marked an epoch in world history. On July 23, 1901, the United States Government sent 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands. This event was significant as it was the first time a conquering people sent educators to benefit the conquered instead of soldiers to subjugate them. The author was part of this group and recounts their journey from San Francisco to Manila.

The group traveled on the United States Army Transport "Thomas" and passed through the Golden Gate, witnessing whales and enjoying the scenery. They stopped at Honolulu, where they visited the Pali, a gigantic precipice, and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. The museum featured a collection of Polynesian artifacts, including a royal robe made from birds' feathers worth over $300,000.

The group continued their journey, crossing the International Date Line, and losing a day in the process. They celebrated with the traditional "Revels of Neptune" ceremony. Upon arriving in Manila, they were struck by the rough waters of the bay and the city's unique blend of cultures. The author describes the city's architecture, which was modeled after medieval European towns, and its history, which included pirate attacks and sieges by Moro bands.

The author visited the old stone bridge, which connected the old city to the new, and observed the bustling traffic and diverse population. They saw people from various nationalities, including English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos, all going about their daily business. The author and their fellow teachers spent two weeks in Manila awaiting assignment to their stations, and eventually received a notice requiring them to prepare for their postings by acquiring certain articles.

The author's account provides a unique perspective on this significant event in history, highlighting the cultural and educational exchange between the United States and the Philippines. The book aims to share the author's personal experiences and observations, offering insights into the people, places, and customs they encountered during their journey. The author's hope is that the book will be of interest to readers who appreciate stories of adventure, education, and cultural exchange. Overall, the book provides a fascinating glimpse into a pivotal moment in history and the people who shaped it.
