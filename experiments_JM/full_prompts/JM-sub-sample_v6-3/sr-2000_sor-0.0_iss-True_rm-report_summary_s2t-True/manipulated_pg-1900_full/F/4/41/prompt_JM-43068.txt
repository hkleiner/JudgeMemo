2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet was a prominent painter of peasant life, known for his profound and sympathetic renderings of everyday life. He was born on October 4, 1814, in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, to a peasant family. Millet's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was encouraged by his family to pursue his artistic talents. He began drawing at a young age and was eventually sent to Cherbourg to study with a local painter, Mouchel.

Millet's artistic style was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, particularly the works of Andrea Mantegna. He was also drawn to the works of Michelangelo and the antique. In 1837, Millet moved to Paris to further his artistic career, where he faced significant challenges and criticism. Despite these obstacles, he continued to paint, producing works that were often rejected by the Salon.

Millet's breakthrough came when he moved to Barbizon, a small village on the outskirts of Paris, where he joined a community of artists, including Théodore Rousseau. It was during this period that he produced some of his most famous works, including "The Sower" and "The Gleaners." These paintings showcased his ability to capture the dignity and beauty of peasant life.

Millet's art was not without controversy, and he faced criticism for his depiction of the harsh realities of rural life. His painting "The Man with the Hoe" was particularly criticized for its perceived socialist tendencies. Despite this, Millet remained committed to his artistic vision, and his work continued to gain recognition.

Throughout his life, Millet struggled with financial difficulties, and he was often forced to rely on the support of his friends and patrons. He died on January 20, 1875, at the age of 60, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's art is characterized by its simplicity, sincerity, and profound emotional depth, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important artists of the 19th century.

Millet's influence can be seen in the work of many other artists, including Giovanni Segantini, who was inspired by Millet's example. Today, Millet's paintings are considered some of the most important works of the 19th century, and they continue to be celebrated for their beauty, dignity, and profound insight into the human condition. Despite his struggles and criticisms, Millet remained true to his artistic vision, and his work continues to inspire and move audiences around the world.

Millet's life was marked by a deep connection to the natural world and a profound sympathy for the struggles of the common people. His art reflects this, and his paintings are infused with a sense of melancholy and introspection. He was a poet, a philosopher, and a great thinker, and his art continues to be a powerful expression of his unique vision and perspective.

Overall, Millet's legacy is one of profound sincerity and emotional depth, and his art continues to be celebrated for its beauty, dignity, and insight into the human condition. His influence can be seen in the work of many other artists, and his paintings remain some of the most important works of the 19th century.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8762):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among his contemporaries for his profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday life. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, absorbing sincerity, and subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters. His paintings, such as "The Angelus", convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are not sentimental, but rather a truthful portrayal of the struggles and simple faith of peasant life. Millet's unique style and technique, shaped by his own life experiences and connection to the natural world, have secured his position as a great artist, even if he may not be considered a technical virtuoso.

Section section_04 (Chars 25875–34565):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's early life was marked by his exceptional observational skills and talent for drawing, which were encouraged by his family. He was apprenticed to a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, and later to M. Langlois, who tried to mold him in the classical tradition, but Millet eventually struck out on his own. With Langlois' support, Millet received a modest pension from the Municipal Council to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin. Millet's time in Paris was marked by struggle and discouragement, particularly during his brief stint in the studio of Delaroche, whose academic style clashed with Millet's innovative approach to art. Despite these challenges, Millet persevered, driven by his passion for art and his unique vision, which would eventually lead him to become a renowned painter.
