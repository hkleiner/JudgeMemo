You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Will Bradley was a renowned American designer, printer, and editor. He was born in 1868 in Boston and began his career as a printer's devil at the age of 12. Bradley's early work was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and the work of William Morris. He established his own press, the Wayside Press, in 1895 and published his own magazine, Bradley: His Book.

Bradley's work was characterized by his use of the Caslon typeface and his emphasis on simplicity and elegance. He was a pioneer in the use of typography and design in advertising and was one of the first designers to use the poster style in magazine covers. Bradley's work had a significant impact on the development of American graphic design and he is still considered one of the most important figures in the field.

In the early 1900s, Bradley worked as an art editor for several magazines, including Collier's and Good Housekeeping. He also designed typefaces and ornaments for the American Type Founders company.

It includes stories about his early days as a printer's devil, his establishment of the Wayside Press, and his work as an art editor and designer. The autobiography also includes anecdotes about Bradley's interactions with other notable figures of the time, including William Randolph Hearst and Richard Harding Davis.

Overall, Will Bradley's life and career were marked by his innovative approach to graphic design and typography, as well as his dedication to simplicity and elegance. His work continues to inspire designers and typographers today, and his legacy as one of the most important figures in American graphic design remains unchallenged.

Section section_05 (Chars 33148–41781):
Section Summary: During the Victorian period, typography had declined, with typefounders producing novelty faces and compositors mixing multiple typefaces. However, the author, Will Bradley, developed a love for traditional Caslon typefaces, which was reinforced by a visit to the Boston Public Library's Barton collection of Colonial-era books. Bradley's exposure to these classic examples of typography inspired him to establish the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, and to promote a more aesthetic approach to printing. The press's early work, including a sample book for Strathmore paper, showcased Bradley's emphasis on traditional typography and attention to design. This marked the beginning of a new era in commercial printing, with Bradley's work contributing to a broader aesthetic awakening in the field.
