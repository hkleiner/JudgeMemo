# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author embarked on an expedition to study the Sarö Yögur tribe in December 1907. They started from the Chinese town of Chin-t'a and traveled southeast, passing through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed an oasis. The author met three women from the tribe, who wore unique costumes and introduced themselves as Sarö Yögurs. The women were talkative, but the atmosphere changed when the author brought out a camera.

The author visited the village temple, where they met the lamas, and was given a house to stay in. The lamas were initially surprised by the author's presence but eventually warmed up. The author learned about the tribe's customs, including their clothing, food, and marriage practices. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people who live in fixed abodes and engage in minimal agriculture.

The author noted that the tribe's economic condition was low, and they struggled with poverty. The men were often at home, while the women worked outdoors, tending to cattle and carrying water. The author observed that the tribe lacked energy and manliness, particularly among the young men. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique language, which is not written, and their customs are influenced by Buddhism.

The author also visited the Shera Yögur tribe, who live in the mountains. They were greeted by the t'umu, a hereditary governor, who was kind and hospitable. The Shera Yögurs have a similar language and customs to the Sarö Yögurs but are more influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The author learned about their administrative division, marriage practices, and daily life.

The Shera Yögurs are governed by a system of t'umus, who act as judges and manage taxes. They have a unique system of "bones," which determines relationships and marriage eligibility. The author observed that the Shera Yögurs are quick-witted and fond of jokes, but their living conditions are harsh, and they struggle with poverty.

The author spent New Year's Day with the Shera Yögurs, participating in rifle practice and a feast. They were impressed by the tribe's hospitality and kindness. The author noted that the Shera Yögurs have a unique costume, which includes a sheepskin coat and a distinctive head-dress for women. They also observed that the tribe's tents are less comfortable than those of other nomadic tribes.

The author left the Shera Yögurs on January 2nd and traveled to the town of Li-yen, where they were greeted by the friendly old mandarin. The author was impressed by the town's picturesque surroundings and the mandarin's courteous attentions. They received a delicious dinner and admired the mandarin's beautiful fur cape. The author eventually returned to Kanchow, concluding their expedition to study the Sarö and Shera Yögur tribes.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8188):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. As they traveled, they encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs, also known as "yellow barbarians" by the Chinese, claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago. The village has a small temple, where seven or eight lamas live and earn a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history, legends, or songs with the expedition.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögurs are a primitive tribe with distinct physical characteristics, such as a turned-up nose and small eyes, and they have a simple and traditional way of life. Their customs and practices are influenced by their Buddhist beliefs, with lamas playing a significant role in important life events like births, deaths, and weddings. The tribe has a patriarchal society, with property inherited by the wife, but daughters having no rights, and marriage is typically arranged by parents without consulting the young people. The Sarö Yögurs have a limited understanding of medicine, relying on lamas to pray for the sick, and their social gatherings are mostly limited to weddings and occasional visits. The tribe's population has been declining due to unfavorable living conditions, with deaths outnumbering births in recent years.

Section section_04 (Chars 24382–32480):
Section Summary: The author bid farewell to their host and began their journey to the village of Yench'i, accompanied by their men and two packhorses. Along the way, they observed the poor soil and coarse grass, as well as thin and small cows, and noted the lack of energy and manliness among the local Turkish tribe, the Shera Yögurs. The author then traveled to Kanchow, where they obtained a letter of introduction to the Tangutan Prince and prepared for their visit to the "Yellow Tanguts". With a small group of followers, they set out on a winter morning, following a dry river bed and navigating a ravine with icy and stony terrain. As they journeyed deeper into the mountains, they encountered Chinese homesteads, guardhouses, and Buddhist towers, and eventually approached the river Kiito-gol.

Section Summary: The author arrived at K'anglungssu, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, and was struck by the large, massive temple with its gilded Buddha roof-decorations. The monastery's buildings were made of timber, with small, dark rooms and simple furnishings, and the temple itself was decorated with Buddhist pictures and banners. The author noted that the lamas living in the monastery were friendly, but few in number, and that the gegen, or Great Lama, was still a child living in the mountains. The lamas were supported by voluntary contributions and played an important role in the community, but only a small percentage could read the Tangutan language. The author ultimately left the monastery after being unable to persuade the lamas to participate in anthropological measurements, and departed with the t'umu, Rentshen Nurgo, as his guide.

Section section_07 (Chars 48427–55967):
Section Summary: The Yögurs, a Mongolian tribe, believe they share a common ancestry with the Sarö Yögurs, despite linguistic differences. The Chinese government had previously exterminated a tribe called the Hung maotzu, and the Yögurs were later settled in the area, provided with cattle, and considered a kind of irregular troop. The tribe has significantly diminished in size due to death and assimilation with the Chinese, with women outnumbering men and many families having few or no children. The Yögurs have a unique system of "bones" or clans, which determines relationships and marriage eligibility, and they follow traditional customs such as sky burial and arranged marriages. The tribe's administrative division and social practices, including marriage and inheritance customs, are also influenced by their history and cultural traditions.

After marriage, infidelity can occur, but it is not openly acknowledged, and divorce is not practiced, although bigamy is common in cases of childlessness. The Shera Yögurs have distinct physical characteristics, such as medium height, well-formed hands and feet, and black or dark hair, and they are known for their intelligence, curiosity, and fondness for jokes. Their traditional costume consists of a sheepskin coat, scarf, and trousers, with women wearing a distinctive head-dress and ornaments. The Shera Yögurs also have a unique culture, with Chinese influences in their weights, measures, and domestic appliances, but with some traditional practices, such as weaving and joinery, still maintained.

Section Summary: The Yögur people live in uncomfortable tents, but despite their difficult living conditions, they maintain a relatively clean and tidy lifestyle. Their diet consists of traditional nomadic foods such as tea, roasted flour, and meat, which they eat with Chinese chopsticks or their fingers. The Yögurs are a peaceful and content people, with no evidence of quarreling or dissatisfaction, and they spend their evenings singing, praying, and socializing around the fire. Their livestock, including yaks, sheep, and horses, appear to be of good quality, but the Yögurs have not fully recovered from the losses they suffered during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs do not seem to engage in sports or hunting, and their only notable activity is target practice with rifles, which they obtain from Sinin.
