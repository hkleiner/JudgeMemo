# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reign of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets were letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters revealed the difficulties of the script and language, with scribes using Babylonian mythological texts to improve their fluency.

The tablets also showed that the Egyptian court was in a state of turmoil, with the Pharaoh's attempts at reforming the religion causing resistance from the powerful priests of Amon. The king's officials were divided, with some supporting the new doctrine and others remaining loyal to the old religion. The tablets mentioned the king's altered throne-name, "Akhen-Aten," and the changing of names to reflect the new doctrine.

The letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani, revealed the complexities of diplomatic relations in the ancient East. The kings exchanged gifts, including gold, and negotiated marriages to secure alliances. However, the Egyptian Pharaoh's reluctance to give away his daughters in marriage caused difficulties in diplomatic relations.

The tablets also revealed the struggles of the Egyptian vassals in Syria and Canaan, who were plagued by wars, tribute demands, and the immigration of Bedawin tribes. The vassals often appealed to the Pharaoh for help, but the Egyptian government's response was often inadequate. The tablets mentioned the role of Yanhamu, the governor of Lower Egypt, who wielded significant power and influence over the vassals.

The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Aziru, Rib-Addi, and Abdi-kheba, provided insight into the political conditions of the time. Aziru, in particular, was a powerful and cunning vassal who expanded his territory through conquest and diplomacy. The tablets also mentioned the presence of the Habiri, a group of people who were later identified as the Hebrews, in the region.

The Tell el Amarna period was marked by significant political upheaval, with the Egyptian empire facing challenges from the Hittites, Mitani, and other powers. The kingdom of Mitani, in particular, was nearing its fall, and its king, Tushratta, was desperate to secure an alliance with Egypt. The tablets revealed the complexities of the political landscape, with shifting alliances and rivalries between the various powers.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has provided significant insights into the history of the ancient East, revealing the complexities of diplomatic relations, the struggles of the Egyptian vassals, and the political upheaval of the time. The tablets have also shed light on the religious reforms of Pharaoh Akhenaten and the eventual decline of the XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are a valuable resource for understanding the history of the ancient Near East.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8315):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, finding extensive ruins and a well-preserved city plan. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and foreign kings. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and provided insight into the administration and court of the Egyptian pharaohs during the XVIIIth Dynasty, including the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, who marked a shift away from war and towards more cultural and artistic pursuits.

Section section_02 (Chars 8316–16864):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion that worshiped the sun disk, Aten, and built a new capital city called Akhet-Aten. The old priests of Amon in Thebes resisted this change, leading to a conflict between the two groups. Akhenaten's officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and the pharaoh's mother, Queen Teye, also showed respect for her son's new religion. The Asiatic provinces under Egyptian rule enjoyed self-government, but this led to internal conflicts and struggles among the native princes and chiefs, who were also affected by the immigration of nomadic tribes such as the Sutu and Habiri. The Egyptian authorities struggled to maintain control and collect tribute from these provinces, often resulting in conflicts and instability.

Section section_03 (Chars 16865–24974):
Section Summary: The Egyptian government faced challenges in maintaining control over its vassals in Palestine and Syria, who were often tempted to establish independent kingdoms. The Pharaoh's government was well-informed about the situation, but its responses were inadequate, and it often sent small, ineffective military expeditions to quell the unrest. The letters from Asian kings, including those from the Babylonian ruler Kadashman-Bel, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relationships and alliances, with the Egyptians seeking to maintain their prestige and the other kingdoms seeking to gain advantages, including gold and marriage alliances. The Egyptian Pharaohs, particularly Akhenaten, were reluctant to give away their daughters in marriage to foreign kings, which sometimes strained diplomatic relations. The letters also provide insight into the politics and relationships between the kingdoms of Egypt, Babylon, and Mitani, and highlight the challenges of maintaining power and influence in the ancient Near East.

Section section_04 (Chars 24974–33111):
Section Summary: The kingdom of Mitani, ruled by Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt to secure its existence, with Tushratta's predecessors sending their daughters to the Egyptian pharaoh's harem. Tushratta's letters to the Egyptian pharaoh, Nimmuria, were filled with requests for gold and declarations of affection, but his later letters became increasingly greedy. After Nimmuria's death, Tushratta's relationship with the new pharaoh, Akhenaten (also known as Napkhuria), deteriorated, with Akhenaten adopting an insolent tone and neglecting traditional diplomatic etiquette. Meanwhile, Akhenaten's relations with Burnaburiash of Babylonia also soured due to his avarice and disregard for diplomatic norms, leading to retaliation from the Babylonian king. The Egyptian kingdom's foreign relations became increasingly unstable under Akhenaten's rule, with alliances being strained and new tensions emerging.

Section section_05 (Chars 33111–41208):
Section Summary: The Assyrian king Assuruballit exchanged messengers with the Egyptian king, despite being warned against it. A prince of Alashia sent letters to the Egyptian king, discussing commercial matters and mentioning the plague, which had affected his land and people. Tushratta, the king of Mitani, sent letters to the Egyptian king Napkhuria, requesting the delivery of golden statuettes that had been promised by Napkhuria's father, Nimmuria. Napkhuria attempted to fulfill the promise by sending wooden models, but Tushratta insisted on receiving the golden statuettes, leading to a dispute between the two kings. The dispute ultimately led to a cessation of intercourse between the two kingdoms, with Napkhuria threatening to close his land to Mitani's subjects.

Section section_06 (Chars 41209–49207):
Section Summary: The majority of the letters in the Tell el Amarna archives are reports and communications from Egyptian governors and officials in Western Asia, providing valuable historical material for the study of civilization. One of the most notable vassals, Aziru, prefect of the land of the Amorites, was a major threat to the region, having seized control of neighboring territories and formed alliances with Egyptian officials. The city of Tunip and Rib-Addi of Gebal sent desperate letters to Pharaoh, complaining of Aziru's aggression and pleading for help, but their requests were often ignored or delayed. Aziru's cunning and ability to manipulate the system allowed him to evade punishment for many years, but he was eventually summoned to Egypt and arrested. Despite his troublesome behavior, some Syrian and Phoenician princes saw Aziru's actions as a necessary evil, bringing an end to a period of lawlessness and instability in the region.

Section section_07 (Chars 49208–57019):
Section Summary: In Lebanon, Namyauza was struggling with local headmen, while in the south, Labaya attempted to gain power but ultimately failed and was taken captive. In Jerusalem, Abdikheba, the royal captain, complained of hostilities from neighboring prefects and the Habiri, who were likely the Hebrews, already present in the "Promised Land". The Egyptian system of government was blamed for the chaos, as the petty princes received little support or protection from their suzerain. The letters from Abdikheba, Milki-El, and Tagi reveal a chorus of complaint and pleas for help from the king, highlighting the instability and violence in the region. The section also showcases the skillful and flattering writing style of Abi-milki of Tyre, who sought to curry favor with the king through his elegant and rhetorical expressions.

Section section_09 (Chars 64556–70239):
Section Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets provide insight into the political conditions of the time, revealing that King Napkhuria's religious reform did not strengthen Egypt's authority in Asia. The Habiri people continued to attack and expand, taking advantage of Egypt's weakness, while the kingdom of Mitani was on the verge of collapse due to internal struggles and external pressures from the Hittites and Babylonians. Mitani's king, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, but the kingdom eventually fell and was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also met a swift end, with Napkhuria's death in 1370 B.C. marking the beginning of the end of his reform and the city of Tell el Amarna. The clay tablets were ultimately saved by being hidden in the earth, preserving a valuable record of the time for future generations.
