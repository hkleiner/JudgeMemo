You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author describes her experiences in France during World War I, particularly in the war zone. She notes that France is divided into two sections: one where life is relatively normal, and the other, the war zone, where access is restricted. To enter the war zone, one needs a special permit, which the author obtains after weeks of effort and influential connections.

The author visits the war zone, including the towns of Châlons and Bar-le-Duc, where she sees the devastating effects of war. She describes the ruins, the graves of fallen soldiers, and the poverty and desperation of the people. She also visits military hospitals, where she sees the wounded and maimed soldiers, and learns about the work of the Red Cross and other organizations to care for them.

The author is struck by the bravery and resilience of the French people, particularly the women, who are shouldering much of the burden of the war effort. She notes that the French are a proud and patriotic people, who are determined to defend their country against the German invaders.

The author also describes her own experiences as a woman in the war zone, including her encounters with soldiers, officers, and civilians. She notes that women are not allowed to go to the front lines, and that even men are not allowed to take them there. She is frustrated by the restrictions and the bureaucracy, but she is also impressed by the kindness and courtesy of the French people.

The author visits the town of Gerbéviller, which has been largely destroyed by the Germans. She sees the ruins of the town, and meets some of the survivors, including a heroic nun who saved her hospice from destruction.

She urges Americans to support the French war effort, and to contribute to organizations that are helping the wounded and the displaced.

The author also describes her experiences with the organization "Le Bienêtre du Blessé," which aims to provide comfort and support to wounded soldiers. She notes that the organization is doing vital work, but that it needs more support and resources to continue its efforts. She urges Americans to contribute to the organization, and to help the French people in their time of need.

Overall, the author's account provides a vivid and moving picture of life in the war zone, and highlights the bravery, resilience, and determination of the French people.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8282):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted.

Section section_09 (Chars 66377–74850):
Section Summary: The author visited military hospitals in the war zone and saw the need for a supplementary kitchen to provide delicacies, not luxuries, to wounded soldiers. The standard military diet of milk and eggs was not sufficient for many patients, and a private kitchen would allow nurses to provide essential items like broth, sugar, and preserves. The French military discipline is strict, with hospital kitchens closing at 6 PM, leaving patients brought in after hours without sustenance. A private kitchen would enable nurses to provide care and nourishment to patients at any time, potentially saving lives. The author emphasizes the importance of supporting this effort, highlighting the significant contribution that such a kitchen could make to the recovery and well-being of wounded soldiers.
