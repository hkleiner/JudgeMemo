You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, trying to find the Home for Lost Dogs in Battersea to adopt a dog. They follow a man who they think works at the home, but he leads them on a wild goose chase. Eventually, they give up and go home. That evening, while walking across the golf course, they find a small, wet puppy with a brick attached to it by a string. They decide to keep the puppy and name it Excalibur, or Scally for short.

As Scally grows up, he becomes a beloved member of the family. He is a bit of an oddity, with a unique appearance and a tendency to get into trouble. Despite this, he is a gentle and affectionate dog, especially with children. The family tries to teach him tricks, but he is not very successful.

One day, Scally meets a young curate named Gerald, who is immediately smitten with Eileen, the narrator's sister-in-law. Gerald and Eileen start a romance, and Scally becomes a frequent companion on their walks. However, their social differences and Gerald's lack of financial security make their relationship challenging.

Gerald eventually leaves for a new position in the north, and Eileen stays behind. They exchange letters, and Scally becomes a symbol of their love. When the narrator's brother-in-law falls ill, Eileen decides to send Scally to live with Gerald in the north. Scally causes a commotion on the train ride, but eventually settles in with Gerald.

Tragedy strikes when the train is involved in an accident, and Gerald helps rescue people from the wreckage. Scally also plays a hero's role, helping Gerald rescue two children from the burning train. Lord Caversham, a director of the railroad company, is impressed by Gerald's bravery and offers to help him find a new position.

Lord Caversham visits Gerald and offers to help him secure a better-paying position so that he can marry Eileen. Gerald is overjoyed and accepts the offer. The story jumps forward in time, and we see Gerald and Eileen living together with their child, with Scally still by their side. When a tramp comes to their door asking for alms, Eileen uses Scally to chase him away.

The story concludes with the family living happily together, thanks in part to the help of Lord Caversham and the heroism of Scally. Despite the challenges they faced, Gerald and Eileen are able to build a life together, and Scally remains a beloved and integral part of their family. The narrator reflects on the role that Scally played in bringing the couple together and helping them overcome their difficulties.

Section section_03 (Chars 16453–24740):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but awkward companion. Despite being told to go home, Excalibur follows the narrator on a walk and eventually meets up with them at a crossroads. Excalibur is a gentle giant, fond of children and babies, and is often the subject of playful games and activities. However, his memory is poor, as evidenced by an incident where he forgets where he buried a bone, leading to a frantic search and eventual lockdown in the washhouse. Excalibur's antics often cause chaos, including a notable incident where he hides a bone in a cushion behind a guest, Lady Wickham, during a dinner party.

Section section_04 (Chars 24741–32990):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various shopkeepers and animals. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, who was having breakfast. Eileen followed and introduced herself, and the curate was immediately smitten with her. As Eileen and the curate spent more time together, Excalibur found himself acting as a chaperon, and his usual routine was disrupted, including his favorite spot on the tennis lawn, which was now being used for tennis matches between Eileen and the curate. Excalibur was good-natured about the changes, but his slow mind and forgiving nature made him a patient, if sometimes bewildered, observer of the new developments.
