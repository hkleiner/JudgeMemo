    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change and progress in England. The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on the country, bringing about rapid economic growth and urbanization. However, this growth was accompanied by social and economic problems, including poverty, inequality, and exploitation of workers. The aristocracy, who had previously held power, began to lose their influence, and a new middle class emerged.

The Victorian era was also marked by significant intellectual and cultural developments. The Romantic movement, which emphasized emotion and individualism, gave way to a more rational and scientific approach to life. Writers such as Charles Dickens, the Brontë sisters, and Alfred Tennyson produced works that reflected the social and economic changes of the time.

Social reformers such as Carlyle and Ruskin criticized the social and economic systems of the time, arguing that they were unjust and oppressive. The poor and working classes faced significant hardships, including poverty, poor living conditions, and limited access to education and healthcare.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9192):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which broke the continuity between the old order and the new. The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a stable equilibrium, characterized by self-contained villages and a sparse population. The aristocracy held political power and were highly cultivated, but the French Revolution and the war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and increased nationalism. The Victorian Age was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order.

Despite the progress and advancements made during this period, social critics like Disraeli, Carlyle, and Ruskin spoke out against the social ills and the effects of industrialization, advocating for a return to simpler social structures and a focus on beauty and absolute values. The era was marked by a mix of complacency and social indignation, with literature reflecting both the optimism and the criticisms of the time.

Section section_04 (Chars 27124–35902):
Section Summary: In foreign politics, Britain's actions during the Victorian era were often misguided, including the Opium War and the Crimean War, which damaged relations with other countries. The era's prosperity and security were due to temporary advantages, such as England's geographical location and industrial lead, which have since passed. The Romantic movement had a significant impact on English literature, and the Victorian era saw an unprecedented output of books and a growing reading public. The period is notable for producing great literary figures, including Alfred Tennyson, who is considered the most representative figure of Victorian literature. The Victorian era's cultural and intellectual achievements are still worthy of appreciation and respect, despite some modern critics' tendency to disparage them.

Section section_05 (Chars 35903–44562):
Section Summary: Tennyson's technique as a writer of verse was perfect, and he wrote beautifully about beautiful things, including beautiful conduct. His work, such as the Idylls of the King, is an allegory that explores themes of morality and idealism, and is often misunderstood by modern readers who prefer more realistic and scandalous stories. Tennyson's poetry reflects his age, with its mix of conservatism and liberalism, and he was concerned about the social and political changes of his time, foreseeing many of the evils that would come to pass. He also represented the Victorian mood in religion, which was characterized by a decline in traditional dogma and a rise in skepticism, but still clung to the belief in personal human survival. Overall, Tennyson's work is a product of his time, but its themes and concerns remain relevant today.

Section section_06 (Chars 44563–52201):
Section Summary: The Victorian era was a time of great literary and cultural achievement in England, with notable figures such as Tennyson, Dickens, and Thackeray. The era's greatness was due to a combination of circumstances that were transient and have since passed. Despite its many accomplishments, the era was also marked by social and economic problems, including the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and the growth of parasitism. The speaker believes that the Victorian Age, along with the Elizabethan Age, represents a peak in English civilization, and that the country's grand scale work is likely nearing its end. The future of England now depends on the younger generation, who will shape the country's destiny in the years to come.
