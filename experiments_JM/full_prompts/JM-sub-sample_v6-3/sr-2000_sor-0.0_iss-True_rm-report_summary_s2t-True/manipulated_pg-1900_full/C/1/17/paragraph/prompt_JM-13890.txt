You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and began to convert the Saxons to Christianity, with Ethelbert himself being baptized and the city of Canterbury becoming a center of Christian worship. The church of St. Martin's is believed to be one of the oldest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain, and it is thought to have been built on the site of a Roman church. Canterbury suffered various attacks, including a devastating raid by the Danes in 1011, but was rebuilt and restored by subsequent rulers, including the Danish king Canute and the Norman archbishop Lanfranc. The city's cathedral has undergone several transformations over the centuries, with the current Norman-style building replacing the original Saxon church in 1070.

Section section_03 (Chars 16961–25609):
Section Summary: To reach the altars in the cathedral, a crypt had to be ascended by several steps from the choir, a design feature that originated from the structural methods of Saxon times. The cathedral, a masterpiece of Norman architecture, was the site of a significant event in history - the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, which occurred 40 years after its construction. Becket had returned to Canterbury after six years of exile and was received with great enthusiasm, but his reunion was short-lived as four knights, sent by King Henry II, arrived with the intention of killing him. The knights, after a tense and confrontational meeting with Becket, ultimately carried out their plan, murdering the Archbishop during Vespers. This event would go on to make Canterbury a famous resort for pilgrims in Europe.

Section section_04 (Chars 25610–34486):
Section Summary: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was brutally murdered by knights in the cathedral, and his death was met with widespread outrage and regret. Despite not being universally admired in life, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, and his shrine at Canterbury Cathedral became a major pilgrimage site, attracting vast crowds and wealth. King Henry II, who had been implicated in Becket's death, performed a public penance at the cathedral, walking barefoot and receiving lashes from bishops and monks. The cathedral suffered a major fire in 1174, but was rebuilt by skilled architects, including William of Sens and William the Englishman. Over the centuries, Canterbury Cathedral continued to be an important site for pilgrims and played host to many grand functions, with its architecture evolving over time, including a major rebuilding in the Perpendicular style between 1378 and 1411.

Section Summary: The north-western tower of Canterbury Cathedral, also known as the Arundel Tower, is the last remaining part of Lanfranc's original church and was rebuilt in 1840. The cathedral's central tower, commenced by Prior Molashe in 1433, is considered an external masterpiece. After reaching its peak, Canterbury began to decline, but its importance as a center of the English Church and its strategic location between England and France helped prevent it from decaying. The cathedral's architecture is a mix of Norman and Perpendicular styles, with various additions and modifications made over the centuries. The cathedral precincts include several notable features, such as the infirmary, treasury, and cloister, which showcase the monastery's history and architectural beauty.

The choir is unique, with elaborately devised eastern parts reconstructed by William of Sens and his English successor, and features richly carved foliated capitals and a profusion of carving. The Trinity Chapel, once home to the shrine of St. Thomas, is now an empty space, but still evokes a sense of history and significance, with notable features including the tomb of the Black Prince and the mosaic pavement.
