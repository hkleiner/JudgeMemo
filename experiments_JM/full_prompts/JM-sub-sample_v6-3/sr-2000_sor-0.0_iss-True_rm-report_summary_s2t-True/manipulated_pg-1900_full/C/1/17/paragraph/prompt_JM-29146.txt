You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is stranded on the planet Irwadi after the government planetarizes the Interstellar Transfer Service. He meets a beautiful Earthgirl, Margot Dennison, who offers him a job to take her to Centauri in exchange for 1,000 credits. Margot is revealed to be a tri-di star, and Ramsey agrees to take her and a Vegan girl, Vardin, to Centauri. However, Margot's true intention is to go to the home of proto-man, a mythical ancestor of all humanoid races.

As they prepare to leave, they are pursued by Garr Symm, the new Chief of Irwadi Security, who is determined to capture them. Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin escape to a Spacer Graveyard, where they work on an old Canopusian freighter to make it space-worthy. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and his team follow them, intent on capturing the ship and its occupants.

After a series of events, the group finally takes off in the freighter, now named Enterprise, and enters hyper-space. However, instead of heading to Centauri, Margot reveals that she wants to go to the home of proto-man, which is located in a shoal in hyper-space. Ramsey is hesitant, but eventually agrees to take her there.

As they approach the shoal, they experience strange occurrences, including a loss of time and a sense of being watched. They eventually land on a world in hyper-space, where they find a black rectangular object that Margot believes is a matter-transmitter. Garr Symm and his team follow them, but they are unable to use their weapons on the timeless world.

Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing chess with proto-man, and realizes that the power of the matter-transmitter is too great for humanity to handle. Vardin, who is revealed to be proto-man, explains that her people had discovered matter-transmission and used it to colonize the galaxy, but it ultimately led to their downfall. Garr Symm, who had jumped into the matter-transmitter, emerges as a caveman-like creature, having been regressed to a primitive state.

In the end, Ramsey and Margot escape, and Vardin disappears, leaving them to ponder the implications of their experience. Margot, who had been driven by her desire for power, realizes that she needs love and is drawn to Ramsey. The two of them blast off into space, ready to start a new life together.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8081):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is among those grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot license. With no income and limited savings, Ramsey and his fellow pilot, Stu Englander, are left to figure out how to support themselves until the situation is resolved. Englander is particularly concerned, as he has a family to provide for and is struggling with a bronchial condition. Ramsey tries to reassure his friend, claiming he has some savings to fall back on, but the situation looks bleak for the stranded pilots.

After spending the night in Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has disappeared, leaving them locked in.

Section section_05 (Chars 31945–40358):
Section Summary: Ramsey found a letter in Margot Dennison's apartment that seemed important to her, and as he read it, he discovered that it was from her father, who was dying of cancer. The letter spoke of a "proto-man" and a hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which could hold the key to immense power and influence in the galaxy. Margot's father had been searching for this secret and wanted Margot to continue his work, but warned her that presenting the information to scientists would be met with laughter and disbelief. Ramsey was perplexed by the letter and its references to proto-man and hyper-space, and he was soon joined by Margot, who had returned to the apartment. The two of them were on the run, with a wanted bulletin issued for their arrest, and they began working on a ship in a Spacer Graveyard at night, planning to escape the planet.
