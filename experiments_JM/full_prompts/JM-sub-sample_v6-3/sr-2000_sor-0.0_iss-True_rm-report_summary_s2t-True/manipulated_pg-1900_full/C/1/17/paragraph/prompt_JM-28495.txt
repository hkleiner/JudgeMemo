You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, trying to find the Home for Lost Dogs in Battersea to adopt a dog. They follow a man who works at the home, but their attempts at stealth are unsuccessful, and they eventually lose him. The next day, while walking home, they find a small, wet puppy that has been tied to a brick and left in a pond. They decide to keep the puppy and name him Excalibur.

As Excalibur grows up, he becomes a beloved member of the family, despite his awkward and clumsy nature. He is particularly fond of children and enjoys playing with them. The family tries to teach him tricks, but he is not very successful. Excalibur's daily walks with Eileen, the narrator's sister-in-law, introduce him to life in the village, where he makes many friends.

One day, while on a walk, Excalibur meets a young curate named Gerald, who is immediately smitten with Eileen. The two begin a romantic relationship, and Excalibur becomes a frequent companion on their outings. However, their social differences and the curate's limited financial resources make their future together uncertain.

The curate decides to leave the village and move to London to find work and improve his situation. Eileen and Excalibur remain in the village, but they continue to exchange letters with the curate. After five years, the curate's circumstances have improved, and he is able to reunite with Eileen and Excalibur.

The family faces a crisis when the narrator's wife, Stella, becomes ill, and the house is shut up. Eileen takes Excalibur to visit friends in the north, but they actually go to London to reunite with the curate. Excalibur causes a sensation in London, and the curate is eventually offered a new position as a rector, thanks to the influence of Lord Caversham, who is grateful for the curate's heroism in saving two children from a train accident.

The curate and Eileen get married, and Excalibur becomes a beloved member of their family. The curate's new position as rector brings them a more comfortable life, and they are able to start a family of their own. Excalibur remains a loyal and protective companion, chasing away a tramp who comes to the rectory asking for alms. The story concludes with Excalibur sleeping peacefully on the lawn, surrounded by his loving family.
