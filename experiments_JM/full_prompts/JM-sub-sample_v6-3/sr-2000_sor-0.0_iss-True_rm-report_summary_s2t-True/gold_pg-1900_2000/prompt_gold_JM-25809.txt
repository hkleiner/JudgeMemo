You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jim Felton sat on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated. Despite the beautiful surroundings, he was bitter about his lack of success in finding gold. He had sunk many prospect holes, but found nothing but ashy wash beneath the surface. Jim's thoughts were also consumed by a letter from his lover, Anne, who had rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability.

Anne's letter explained that she couldn't marry Jim without a guarantee of a steady income, and that his carefree nature was not suited for the responsibilities of marriage. Jim was hurt and angry, but also understood Anne's perspective. He knew she wasn't being mercenary, as she had access to a comfortable income.

As Jim sat on the doorstep, he was interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier. Bud noticed Jim's gloomy mood and tried to cheer him up, suggesting he take a break and go to town to get drunk. Jim declined, feeling that Anne's eye was always on him, and that he should behave as if she were present.

Bud offered Jim two dollars to help him out, but Jim was hesitant to accept, feeling he couldn't pay him back. Bud insisted, saying that's what friends were for, and that he didn't care who got drunk on the money as long as they had a good time. Jim eventually accepted the offer, and Bud suggested he take his horse to ride to the nearest station, 50 miles away in Plattsburg.

Instead, Jim asked Bud to round up a burro for him, and Bud agreed. As they waited, Bud told Jim about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail. Bud chased the man and gave him $10, warning him not to bother him again. When the burro arrived, Jim tied a gunny sack to its back and prepared to leave. Bud bid him farewell, and Jim rode off on his new mount, feeling a sense of gratitude towards his friend.

The conversation with Bud had lifted Jim's spirits, and he felt a sense of hope that he might finally find success in the gulch. As he rode away, he thought about Anne's letter and his own situation, feeling a sense of determination to prove himself and make a better life for himself and Anne. The beautiful scenery of the gulch and the sound of the wind in the trees accompanied Jim as he rode off into the unknown. Despite his struggles, Jim felt a sense of peace and contentment, knowing that he had a good friend like Bud looking out for him.
