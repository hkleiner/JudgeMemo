You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author wants to discuss the bookman, rather than his books, and define what a bookman is. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature. Having many books does not necessarily make someone a bookman, as they may be a collector or a seller. A true bookman is born, not made, and has a natural affinity for literature.

The author recounts a story about a man who invited him to dinner and showed off his expensive bookcase, but it was clear that the man was not a bookman. The books were behind glass doors, and the man was more interested in showing off his wealth than in discussing literature. A bookman, on the other hand, wants to be able to access his books easily and handle them freely.

The author also tells the story of a colonial squatter who asked a friend to send him some books, and the friend spent a month selecting the best of English literature. However, the squatter's response was to ask if anything new had been written by Shakespeare or Milton, showing a lack of knowledge about literature. Despite this, the squatter had a natural instinct for what was good in literature, and the author argues that this is more important than formal education or training.

A bookman is someone who can distinguish between good and bad literature, and who has a deep appreciation for the classics. They may enjoy lighter reading, such as detective stories, but they also have a sense of what is truly great in literature. The author mentions several authors and books, including Mark Rutherford, George Borrow, and the Revelation in Tanner's Lane, as examples of great literature that may not be widely known.

The author argues that the role of the critic is to distinguish between books that are fleeting and those that are truly great and will last. A great book is one that enriches the human mind, adds to its treasures, and speaks to all people in a unique and timeless way. Such books are classics, and they have a wisdom and beauty that transcends time and age.

The subject of a book is not as important as its quality, and a bookman is open to reading about any subject. They are not limited by sect or ideology, and they can appreciate great literature from any tradition. The author mentions several examples of great literature, including the Pilgrim's Progress and the works of Milton, and argues that these books have a timeless quality that makes them truly great.

Overall, the author is celebrating the bookman, who is a lover of literature and a seeker of truth and beauty. They are not just collectors or scholars, but people who have a deep passion for reading and a sense of what is truly great in literature. The author is arguing that this kind of love and appreciation for literature is essential, and that it is what makes life rich and meaningful.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8182):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare and Milton demonstrates a natural affinity for literature, despite his lack of formal education. The author concludes that a true bookman can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless classics, and values the latter for their enduring literary merit.

Section section_02 (Chars 8182–11681):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact. A true classic, according to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, is a book that enriches the human mind, speaks to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcends the limitations of a single age. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author, a self-proclaimed bookman, values these classic works and believes they should be distinguished from more ordinary books that may only be relevant for a short time. The subject matter of a book is not as important as its literary quality, and a bookman should be open to works from various perspectives and styles.
