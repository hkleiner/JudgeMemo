You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born on March 16, 1822, in Bordeaux, France, to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a painter and drawing master, and her mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician. The family struggled financially, and Raymond had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. In 1828, the family's friends, the Silvelas, moved to Paris and encouraged Raymond to join them, promising a better life and more opportunities for his art.

Raymond eventually made the move to Paris, leaving his family behind temporarily. He worked as a drawing instructor and gained recognition for his work, including a commission from the naturalist Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. In 1829, the rest of the family joined him in Paris, and they settled into a new home. Rosa, who was seven years old at the time, was enrolled in a boys' school, where she developed boyish manners and a strong personality.

As Rosa grew older, she showed a keen interest in art, and her father encouraged her to develop her skills. She began drawing and painting at a young age and quickly demonstrated a talent for it. However, her education was disrupted by the revolution of 1830, which caused financial difficulties for the family. Despite these challenges, Rosa continued to pursue her passion for art, and her father eventually allowed her to work in his studio.

Rosa's first painting, a still life of cherries, was completed when she was just 11 years old. Her father was impressed with her work and encouraged her to continue studying art. Rosa spent many hours copying the works of the great masters at the Louvre and practicing her drawing and painting skills. She developed a unique style and a deep understanding of animal anatomy, which would become a hallmark of her work.

As Rosa entered her teenage years, she began to focus on painting animals, which she loved and understood deeply. She persuaded her father to allow her to keep a menagerie in their home, which included a sheep, a goat, and various other animals. This allowed her to study and paint her subjects up close. In 1841, Rosa submitted two works to the Salon, a painting of two rabbits and a drawing of dogs and sheep, both of which were accepted.

Over the next few years, Rosa continued to submit her work to the Salon, gradually gaining recognition and critical acclaim. Her paintings were praised for their sincerity, vigor, and attention to detail, particularly in her depiction of animals. Rosa's hard work and dedication paid off, and she established herself as a talented and innovative artist. She continued to paint and exhibit her work throughout her life, always striving for perfection and pushing the boundaries of her art.
