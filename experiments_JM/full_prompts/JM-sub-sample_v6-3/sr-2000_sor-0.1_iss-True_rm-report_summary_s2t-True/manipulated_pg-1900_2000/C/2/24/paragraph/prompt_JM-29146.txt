You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and hyper-space pilot, is on the planet Irwadi, where he works for the Interstellar Transfer Service. He is approached by a Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, who informs him that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Transfer Service, effectively taking control of all hyper-space ships on the planet. Ramsey is shocked and skeptical, as he knows that transferring a starship from normal space to hyper-space is a difficult and technical task.

The Security Officer explains that all outworld pilots, including Ramsey, are no longer allowed to fly and will have to find alternative means of supporting themselves until they can be removed from the planet. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot's license and is told that the Polaris, a Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, is temporarily grounded.

Ramsey meets with his friend Stu Englander, a fellow hyper-space pilot who is struggling to make ends meet due to his bronchial condition. Englander is worried about supporting his family, and Ramsey offers to help him out with some credits. Englander is grateful, but Ramsey insists that it's not charity and that he can pay him back when he gets a chance.

As the night wears on, Ramsey visits a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, where he loses most of his credits. He is approached by a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who is looking for trouble. The Irwadian accuses Ramsey of being a troublemaker and tells him to leave, but Ramsey stands his ground.

The atmosphere in the gambling hall becomes tense, and Ramsey realizes that he is the only Earthman present. He decides not to risk a confrontation and leaves the hall, aware that the Irwadian's behavior is a result of the frenzy of planetarization that is sweeping the planet.

Ramsey reflects on his situation and the fact that he is a fugitive from Earth. He has been lucky in the past, but he knows that he will have to be careful to avoid trouble on Irwadi. He thinks about his limited credits and the fact that he owes rent to his landlady, and he wonders what the future holds for him and the other outworlders on the planet.

The planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a difficult situation for Ramsey and the other outworld pilots, who are no longer allowed to work and are struggling to make ends meet. The Irwadians, on the other hand, seem to be enjoying their newfound power and are taking advantage of the situation to assert their dominance over the outworlders.

As Ramsey navigates the challenges of life on Irwadi, he is aware that he will have to be resourceful and determined to survive. He is a skilled pilot, but he knows that he will have to find alternative ways to support himself until the situation on Irwadi changes. With his limited credits and his reputation as a troublemaker, Ramsey faces an uncertain future on a planet that seems determined to make life difficult for outworlders.

Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all outworld ships and stranding their pilots. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworld pilots and passengers stranded on Irwadi, and it's unclear how they will manage to survive until a resolution is found.
