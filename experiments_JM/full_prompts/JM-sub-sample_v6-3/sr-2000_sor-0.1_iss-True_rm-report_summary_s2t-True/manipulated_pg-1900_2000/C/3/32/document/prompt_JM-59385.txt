    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story is dedicated to the women of America and tells the tale of a Chinese girl named Yen Kuei Ping. The narrative begins with a description of the Street of Precious Pearls, a side street in a Chinese town where precious jewels are sold. The street is narrow and quiet, with moss-covered buildings and grass growing through the paving stones. Yen Kuei Ping visits this street with her grandmother, Madame Yen, and her mother to buy dowry jewels.

According to ancient custom, a betrothed bride must convert her inheritance into precious stones to avoid reflecting poorly on her new family's ability to support her. Madame Yen and her relatives arrive at a shop with rich filigree carvings and velvet doors, where they are greeted by the owner, Wong Lui, and his attendants. The women are offered tea and stools to sit on, and Wong Lui presents them with a selection of precious jewels.

Yen Kuei Ping is particularly fond of pearls and is allowed to handle them, feeling their beauty and warmth. Her grandmother and Wong Lui engage in a game of bargaining, with each trying to outmaneuver the other. Meanwhile, Yen Kuei Ping's mind wanders back to her time at a mission school, where she was taught by an American girl named Miss Porter.

Yen Kuei Ping had idolized Miss Porter as an "Angel of Freedom" and had been inspired by her stories of equal opportunity in the United States. However, when Miss Porter suggested that Yen Kuei Ping could return to China and help her countrywomen, Yen Kuei Ping knew it was impossible due to her family's plans for her marriage. She had been engaged since she was a child and was expected to fulfill her family's obligations.

The memory of her conversation with Miss Porter is bittersweet for Yen Kuei Ping, who feels torn between her desire for freedom and her duty to her family. She had wept over her inability to pursue her dreams and had kept her feelings hidden from her grandmother and others. The scene returns to the present, where Madame Yen and Wong Lui finalize their bargain, and the women prepare to leave the shop.

As they depart, Yen Kuei Ping hands over the pearls she had been holding, and the group is bowed out of the shop by Wong Lui and his attendants. The chair-bearers wait patiently outside to carry the women away. The story ends with a sense of Yen Kuei Ping's conflicted emotions and the weight of her family's expectations. The Street of Precious Pearls, once a symbol of beauty and freedom, now represents the constraints of her traditional life.
