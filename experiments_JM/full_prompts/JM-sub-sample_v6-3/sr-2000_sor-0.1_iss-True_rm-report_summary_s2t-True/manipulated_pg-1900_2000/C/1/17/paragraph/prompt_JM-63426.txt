You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The introduction to Will Bradley's chap book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts. Bradley's work brought a fresh and modern style to the field, which was previously stagnant. He is credited with introducing the American public to new and exciting design elements, paving the way for future generations of artists. Bradley's career spanned several decades, and his work was featured in various mediums, including magazines, newspapers, and advertising.

The author notes that Bradley's early work showed derivative traces, but as he matured, he developed a unique and distinctly American style. He drew inspiration from American colonial typography, which he used as a springboard to create innovative and exuberant designs. Bradley's work was not limited to traditional art forms; he also explored new mediums, such as movies.

The author praises Bradley's pioneering spirit and his ability to break down barriers and challenge conventional norms. Bradley's influence can still be seen today, and many young artists are unaware of the debt they owe to him. The author expresses gratitude to Bradley for his contributions to the field and acknowledges his lasting impact on American graphic arts.

The chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" provides a biographical account of Bradley's early life. Born in 1875, Bradley grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts, and developed an interest in art and printing at a young age. He attended school, but his true passion was printing, and he spent much of his free time learning about the trade. Bradley's mother encouraged his interest, and he eventually acquired a printing press, which he used to create his own publications.

As a young boy, Bradley worked various jobs to support himself and his family. He delivered finished work to factories and returned with unfinished work, earning five cents per trip. He also helped his father, who was a cartoonist for a local newspaper. Bradley's uncle, who was a paymaster at the Lake Superior Iron Mine, played an important role in his early life, and Bradley often visited him in Northern Michigan.

Bradley's formal education was limited, and he struggled with arithmetic. However, he found solace in art and printing, and he eventually dropped out of school to pursue a career in the field. He worked as a printer's devil and later as a job printer, earning a steady income and gaining valuable experience.

The story takes a turn when Bradley's family moves to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he begins working at the Iron Agitator, a local newspaper. He learns the ins and outs of the printing trade and quickly becomes an essential member of the team. Bradley's wages increase over time, and he becomes known as a skilled and reliable printer.

The chapter provides a charming and detailed account of Bradley's early life, highlighting his passion for printing and his determination to succeed. It also offers a glimpse into the challenges and opportunities faced by young people in the late 19th century. Through his story, Bradley's pioneering spirit and innovative approach to design are evident, and his legacy as a trailblazer in American graphic arts is solidified.
