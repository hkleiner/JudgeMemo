# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, a small town in southern France. His father, a glovemaker, wanted him to pursue a career in commerce. However, Fragonard's passion lay in art. As a young boy, he would often hear gossip about the latest news from Paris, including the scandals surrounding King Louis XV and his mistresses. 

At the age of 13, Fragonard heard about the king's new mistress, Madame de Pompadour, who would later become a prominent figure in his life. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed in 1748, marking the beginning of a new era of peace in Europe. Fragonard's mother, recognizing his talent, decided to take him to Paris to pursue a career in art. 

In Paris, Fragonard's mother introduced him to the famous painter Nicolas Boucher, who was known for his elegant and charming works. Boucher was impressed by Fragonard's sketches and decided to take him on as a student. However, Fragonard was initially sent to study with Chardin, a master of still-life painting. Chardin was disappointed with Fragonard's progress and sent him away. 

Undeterred, Fragonard continued to practice and eventually returned to Boucher's studio. Boucher was impressed by Fragonard's improvement and took him on as a student. Fragonard worked on preparing large decorative cartoons for the Gobelins and Beauvais looms. This training proved to be ideal for Fragonard, and he quickly made progress. 

The Director-General of Buildings, Lenormant de Tournehem, died suddenly, and the Pompadour appointed her brother, Abel Poisson de Vandières, to replace him. Fragonard would later benefit from Vandières' patronage. After two years of training with Boucher, Fragonard was encouraged to compete for the Prix de Rome. 

At the age of 20, Fragonard won the coveted prize with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." He then spent three years studying at the king's school under Carle Van Loo. During this time, Fragonard continued to work in Boucher's studio and produced several notable paintings, including "Blind Man's Buff." 

The years that followed were marked by turmoil, with quarrels between priests and parliaments growing increasingly bitter. In 1756, King Louis XV was stabbed by Robert-François Damiens, a incident that would have far-reaching consequences. Despite the turmoil, Fragonard's career continued to flourish, thanks in part to the patronage of the Pompadour and her brother, Vandières. 

Fragonard's early life and training laid the foundation for his future success as a painter. His experiences in Paris, including his time with Boucher and Chardin, helped shape his style and technique. The patronage of the Pompadour and her brother, Vandières, also played a significant role in Fragonard's career.

From his humble beginnings in Grasse to his rise to fame in Paris, Fragonard's journey is a fascinating tale of art, politics, and intrigue. With the support of his family and the patronage of prominent figures, Fragonard was able to pursue his passion for art and become one of the most celebrated painters of his time.
