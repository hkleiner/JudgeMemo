You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: In 1820, it was known that a great city of Ancient Egypt existed in Middle Egypt. The Prussian exploration expedition of 1842-45 investigated the site and found extensive ruins near the village of Haggi Kandil. The city was identified as El Amarna, built by Amenophis IV around 1380 B.C. The site was well-preserved due to its sudden downfall and desolation. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl discovered clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums.

The tablets were written in Babylonian cuneiform and consisted of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. Some tablets had hieroglyphic names of King Amenophis IV and his father, Amenophis III. The letters dealt with various topics, including diplomacy and trade. The scribes who wrote the letters were not always skilled, and some used Babylonian mythological texts to improve their fluency.

The Tell el Amarna tablets revealed that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The tablets also showed that the Egyptian court and administration were complex, with various officials and governors playing important roles. The two Pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna period, Amenophis III and IV, belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from Asiatic invaders.

Amenophis III reigned for 36 years and introduced a new era of peace and prosperity, marked by a decline in the warlike spirit of the Egyptian court. His son, Amenophis IV, was also inclined towards peace and introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, emphasizing the worship of the sun disk, Aten. This reform led to a conflict with the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, who resisted the new doctrine.

The king's efforts to introduce the new religion were met with resistance, and he eventually moved the court to Tell el Amarna, which was consecrated as the new capital. The officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and some, like Ai, received golden honors. The Aten dogma was based on natural phenomena and was considered heretical by the traditional priests.

The Amarna letters provide valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the Egyptian court during this period. The letters reveal the complex relationships between the Egyptian monarch, his officials, and the Asiatic vassals. The officials who played important roles in the administration included Ai, Dudu, Amanappa, and Yanhamu, who was the governor of Lower Egypt.

Overall, the discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has provided significant information about the history and culture of Ancient Egypt during the XVIIIth Dynasty. The tablets have shed light on the complex relationships between the Egyptian court, its officials, and the Asiatic vassals, as well as the introduction of a new religion and its impact on the traditional priestly class.

Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to the Egyptian court and administration. The tablets also revealed the complex system of writing and diplomacy used by the ancient Egyptians and their counterparts in Asia, with scribes using various languages and scripts to communicate.

Section section_02 (Chars 8547–12782):
Section Summary: The life of King Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, is not well understood, but it is believed that he intended to reform the Egyptian religion and reduce the power of the priests of Amon in Thebes. He introduced a new doctrine, known as "the doctrine," which emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, or Aten, and led to a break with the old religion. The king and his officials adopted new names and titles, and a new capital city, Akhet-Aten, was built to replace Thebes. The new doctrine was not widely accepted, and many officials and vassals in Syria and Palestine continued to refer to the old god Amon, with only a few acknowledging the change. The king rewarded his loyal officials, such as Ai and Amanappa, with honors and important positions, and established a new administration in Lower Egypt, known as Yarimuta, under the governorship of Yanhamu.
