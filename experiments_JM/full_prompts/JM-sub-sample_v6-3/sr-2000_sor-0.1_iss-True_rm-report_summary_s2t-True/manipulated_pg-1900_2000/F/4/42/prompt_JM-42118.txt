You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, a small town in southern France. His father, a glovemaker, wanted him to follow in his footsteps, but Fragonard's passion was art. The town of Grasse was far from the artistic hub of Paris, and news of the city's latest trends and scandals trickled in slowly. Fragonard grew up surrounded by the beauty of Provence, which would later influence his art.

As a child, Fragonard heard about the death of Cardinal Fleury and the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became the king's mistress. The Pompadour was a patron of the arts and gathered prominent artists and thinkers around her. Fragonard's early life was marked by a desire to create art, and he spent much of his time drawing and painting.

At the age of 16, Fragonard's father apprenticed him to a notary, but the young man's heart was not in it. His mother, recognizing his talent, took him to Paris to meet the famous artist François Boucher. Boucher was impressed by Fragonard's sketches and advised him to study with Jean-Siméon Chardin, a master of still-life painting.

Fragonard worked with Chardin for a time but made little progress. He was then sent away and forced to rely on his own resources. He spent his days studying the masterpieces in Parisian churches and painting from memory. After six months, Fragonard returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a student.

Boucher taught Fragonard the art of painting decorative cartoons for tapestries. This training served Fragonard well, and he quickly developed his skills. The Pompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandières, was appointed Director-General of Buildings, and Fragonard would later benefit from his patronage.

Fragonard competed for the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art prize, and won it at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." He then studied at the king's school under Carle Van Loo and continued to work in Boucher's studio. During this time, Fragonard created several notable works, including "Blind Man's Buff."

The 1750s were marked by turmoil in France, with quarrels between priests and parliaments. The king's popularity waned, and he was eventually stabbed by a disgruntled subject. Despite the unrest, Fragonard's career continued to flourish, thanks in part to the support of Boucher and the Pompadour's family. Fragonard's time in Paris had been instrumental in shaping his artistic style, and he would go on to become one of the most celebrated artists of his generation.

Growing up in a picturesque Provençal setting, Fragonard was surrounded by natural beauty that would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful patron of the arts. At the age of 15, Fragonard's father attempted to steer him towards a respectable career as a notary's clerk, but the young man's passion for art led him to idle and eventually pursue his creative interests. Fragonard's early life was marked by a tension between his father's practical expectations and his own artistic ambitions.

Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, after reviewing the boy's sketches, advised him to train with Chardin to learn the basics of painting, but Fragonard made little progress and was eventually sent away. Undeterred, Fragonard continued to practice and returned to Boucher six months later, showing significant improvement, and was taken on as a student. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard worked on decorative cartoons and enlargements for tapestries, which provided ideal training for him. At the age of 20, Fragonard won the prestigious Prix de Rome with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols," launching his successful artistic career.
