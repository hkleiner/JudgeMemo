You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: In 1820, it was known that a great city of Ancient Egypt existed in Middle Egypt, on the east bank of the Nile. The Prussian exploration expedition of 1842-45 discovered extensive ruins at El Amarna, about sixty miles south of Minieh. The site was found to be the remains of the city of Akhet-haten, built by Amenophis IV around 1380 B.C. The city was abandoned after the king's death, and its remains were well-preserved due to the sudden and violent downfall.

In 1888, some fellahin digging for marl near the ruins found a number of clay tablets with writing on both sides. The tablets were written in Babylonian cuneiform and were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV. The discovery included letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, as well as letters from Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch.

The tablets were found in wooden chests, which were likely used as lids, and some had hieroglyphic names of King Amenophis IV and his father, Amenophis III. The letters were written by professional scribes, and some included notes in hieratic script written in red ink. The language used was Babylonian, which was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time.

The Egyptian court and administration during this period were characterized by a shift from a warlike spirit to a more peaceful and cultural approach. Amenophis III, who reigned for 36 years, focused on building and cultivating "wisdom," while his son, Amenophis IV, attempted to reform the Egyptian religion, introducing a kind of monotheism that worshipped the disk of the sun, known as the Aten.

The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was built, and the royal court moved from Thebes to this new city. The officials who accepted the new doctrine were regarded as deserving men, and some received golden honors. The Aten dogma was based on natural phenomena and was considered heretical. The hymns to Aten found on the walls of some tombs expressed devout feeling and a monotheistic tendency.

The officials who served under Amenophis IV included Ai, who was a secretary of state, and Dudu, who occupied an important post. Amanappa was a commander-in-chief, and Hani, Salma, and others appeared as bearers of royal commissions in Syrian territory. The governorship of Lower Egypt, known as Yarimuta, was an important office filled by Yanhamu. The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets provided valuable insights into the history and culture of Ancient Egypt during this period. 

The tablets were written in a variety of clay, from pale yellow to red or dark brown, and some were well-preserved, while others were broken and crumbling. The scribes who wrote the letters often used phonograms that could be easily spelled out, and some included translations of Babylonian words into Canaanite. The letters also revealed the difficulties of communication between the Egyptian court and its officials in Syria and Canaan, as well as the relationships between the Egyptian monarch and the Asiatic kings.

Overall, the discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has shed new light on the history and culture of Ancient Egypt during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, and has provided valuable insights into the language, religion, and politics of the time. The tablets have also revealed the complexities of communication and diplomacy in the Ancient East, and the ways in which different cultures and languages interacted and influenced one another.

Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The tablets provide valuable insights into the administration and court of the Egyptian pharaohs during this period, including their relationships with other kingdoms and their internal affairs.

Section section_02 (Chars 8316–12794):
Section Summary: The Egyptian king, Amenophis IV, later known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion that worshipped the sun disk, Aten, as the chief deity. He attempted to reform the traditional Egyptian religion, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, leading to open strife and the eventual relocation of the court to a new city, Akhet-Aten. The king and his officials adopted the new religion, and those who accepted it were rewarded, while the old religion was still practiced by officials in Syria and Palestine who were not formally informed of the change. The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was consecrated and became the center of the new religion, with the queen-mother Teye showing respect for her son's opinions by visiting the city. The Aten dogma represented a shift towards a more natural and spontaneous form of worship, but its impact on religious thought is still a matter of interpretation.
