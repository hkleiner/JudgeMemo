You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author of the book participated in a historic movement, which is the subject of the book. The movement began on July 23, 1901, when the United States Government sent 499 trained men and women to the Philippine Islands to establish a system of free public schools. This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The teachers sailed from San Francisco on the United States Army Transport "Thomas" and passed through the Golden Gate, bound for the Philippines.

The ship stopped at Honolulu, where the teachers had the opportunity to visit the Pali, a gigantic precipice, and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. The museum contains a collection of artifacts illustrating the life and customs of Polynesia, including a royal robe made from birds' feathers. The robe is valued at over $300,000 and was made from the feathers of birds that are now extinct.

The teachers also witnessed the sport of surf-shooting, where native Hawaiians ride waves on long, narrow boards. After leaving Honolulu, the ship crossed the International Date Line, and the teachers lost a day in the process. The crew held a celebration, known as the "Revels of Neptune," which is a traditional sailor's ceremony.

The ship eventually arrived in Manila, where the teachers were introduced to the local culture. They were struck by the rough waters of Manila Bay and the cosmopolitan mixture of people in the city. The teachers saw men and women from various ethnic groups, including Filipinos, Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans. They also observed the local customs, including the traditional clothing and the practice of chewing cigars.

The teachers spent two weeks in Manila awaiting assignment to their stations. During this time, they experienced the rainy season and the resulting discomfort. They also had the opportunity to explore the city, including the old stone bridge that connects the old city to the new. The bridge was bustling with activity, with thousands of pedestrians and vehicles passing through.

The teachers were eventually assigned to their stations, but not before receiving a notice requiring them to supply themselves with certain articles. The notice caused consternation among the teachers, who were unsure of what to expect in their new assignments. Overall, the book provides a unique perspective on a significant event in world history and offers insights into the culture and customs of the Philippines and Hawaii during the early 20th century. The author's experiences and observations provide a fascinating account of a pivotal moment in time. The book is a valuable resource for those interested in history, education, and cultural studies. The author's writing style is engaging and informative, making the book an enjoyable read. The story is full of interesting characters, places, and events that bring the history to life.
