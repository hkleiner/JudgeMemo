You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is stranded on the planet Irwadi after the government planetarizes the Interstellar Transfer Service. He meets Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl who claims to have a ship and offers him a job to take her to Centauri. Ramsey agrees, and they set out to prepare the ship for departure. Along the way, they are joined by Vardin, a timid Vegan girl. As they work on the ship, Ramsey becomes increasingly attracted to Margot, but she seems to be hiding something.

Margot's true intentions are revealed when she forces Ramsey to take the ship down on a mysterious world in hyper-space. The world is revealed to be the home of proto-man, an ancient civilization that colonized the galaxy. Margot believes that the secret to instantaneous travel lies on this world and is determined to uncover it. Ramsey is hesitant, but eventually agrees to follow her.

As they explore the world, they come across a black rectangular object that Margot believes is a matter-transmitter. She attempts to use it, but is stopped by Ramsey, who has a vision of proto-man playing a game of chess with her. The vision suggests that proto-man is still present and is guiding events to prevent humanity from gaining access to the matter-transmitter.

The group is joined by Garr Symm, the Chief of Irwadi Security, who is also seeking the secret of the matter-transmitter. However, when he uses the device, he is transformed into a caveman-like creature, revealing the true nature of the device. Vardin, who is revealed to be a member of the proto-man civilization, explains that the device is a test, and that humanity is not yet ready for the power it offers.

In the end, Ramsey and Margot escape the planet, and Margot comes to realize that her desire for power and knowledge has been misguided. She confesses her love for Ramsey, and they set out to explore the galaxy together. Vardin, meanwhile, remains behind, watching over the galaxy and waiting for the next time she is needed. The story concludes with Ramsey and Margot flying off into the unknown, ready to face whatever challenges come their way.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–16056):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen.

The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations behind it.

When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, and she teases him about his situation with Mith, who mistakenly thinks the Earthgirl is Ramsey's wife.

Section Summary: Ramsey is approached by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl and tri-di star, who offers him a deal: she'll pay him 1,000 credits to take her through hyper-space to Centauri. Margot had previously been trying to get to Earth, but settles for Centauri after reading Ramsey's mind and discovering he's a fugitive from Earth. Ramsey agrees to take her, on the condition that a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After a night at Margot's apartment, she disappears, locking Ramsey and the Vegan girl inside, and Ramsey finds a cryptic letter in her apartment that hints at a significant discovery related to the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter suggests that the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth may hold the key to understanding how humanoid types emerged simultaneously on thousands of stellar worlds.

However, their discovery is interrupted by the arrival of Garr Symm and his men, who attempt to stop Margot from reaching the device. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men, but is shocked when one of them dies from lack of air, despite the fact that time does not exist on this world.
