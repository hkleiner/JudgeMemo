    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violin maker, and his nephew Davy. Anthony is reading a book with Davy's help, and they discuss the story of Paganini. Anthony is a skilled violin maker and player, and his music has a profound effect on those who hear it. He believes that the secret of everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin.

As a child, Anthony hated school and was considered lazy, but he was actually fascinated by the natural world and spent most of his time outdoors, observing and learning. He was especially drawn to music and invented his own instruments, including a violin made from a wooden box and strings. Anthony's mother was worried about his future, but he was determined to make a living from his music.

At the age of 17, Anthony discovered a precious piece of wood in Squire Bean's garret, which he used to make a violin. He spent years studying and perfecting his craft, and his violins became renowned for their beauty and sound. Anthony's life took a turn when his neighbor, Mrs. Butterfield, died, and her niece Lyddy Ann inherited her property.

Lyddy was a recluse who had been disfigured in a fire as a child and had spent most of her life in solitude. She was surprised to find that Anthony was blind and was touched by his music, which seemed to interpret her own emotions and thoughts. Lyddy began to visit Anthony and Davy, and they formed a close bond. She helped to care for Davy when he was sick and eventually became a part of their lives.

As Lyddy spent more time with Anthony and Davy, she found herself opening up and sharing her thoughts and feelings with them. Anthony, in turn, was drawn to Lyddy's kindness, intelligence, and beauty, despite her physical scars. The two formed a deep connection, and Anthony eventually proposed to Lyddy, who accepted. They got married, and Lyddy became Anthony's partner in every sense, helping him with his music and his daily life.

The story concludes with a description of the happy life that Anthony and Lyddy built together. They spent their days surrounded by music, nature, and love, and Anthony's violins continued to bring joy to all who heard them. Lyddy found happiness and fulfillment in her life with Anthony, and he found a partner who appreciated and supported his music and his soul. Together, they created a beautiful and harmonious life, filled with love, music, and beauty.
