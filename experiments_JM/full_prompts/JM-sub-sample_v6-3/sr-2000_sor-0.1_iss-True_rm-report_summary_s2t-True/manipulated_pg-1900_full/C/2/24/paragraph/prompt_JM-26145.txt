# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets are letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters reveal the political situation in Western Asia during the 14th century BC, with Egypt's influence waning and the Habiri, a group of nomadic tribes, expanding their territory.

The tablets also contain letters from foreign kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters show that the Egyptian king was considered equal to other monarchs, but his reluctance to give away his daughters in marriage caused difficulties in diplomatic relations. The tablets also reveal the character of Pharaoh Akhenaten, who was known for his religious reforms and his attempts to demonstrate the strength of his throne.

The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Aziru, Rib-Addi, and Abdi-Kheba, provide insight into the political situation in Syria and Canaan. They describe the conflicts between different city-states and the struggles against the Habiri. The letters also show the importance of the Egyptian official Yanhamu, who played a significant role in the region.

The tablets also contain information about the geography and administration of the region. They mention various cities, including Jerusalem, and describe the relationships between different rulers and their subjects. The letters also provide insight into the social and cultural practices of the time, including the use of cuneiform writing and the importance of gift-giving in diplomatic relations.

The Tell el Amarna period was marked by significant political changes, including the rise of the Hittite empire and the decline of Mitani. The tablets provide valuable information about the history of Western Asia during this period and offer a unique glimpse into the politics, culture, and society of the ancient Near East.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has been significant for the field of ancient Near Eastern studies, providing new insights into the history and culture of the region. The tablets have also been important for the study of the Bible, as they provide historical context for the biblical account of the conquest of Canaan.

Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource, offering a unique perspective on the politics, culture, and society of the ancient Near East during the 14th century BC. They provide valuable information about the history of Western Asia, the rise and fall of empires, and the relationships between different rulers and their subjects.

Section section_02 (Chars 8395–16973):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion in Egypt, worshiping the sun disk, Aten, and built a new capital, Akhet-Aten. The old priests of Amon in Thebes resisted this change, leading to a conflict between the two groups. Akhenaten's officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and the pharaoh's mother, Teye, also showed respect for his opinions. The Asiatic provinces under Egyptian rule enjoyed self-government, but were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute demands, and immigration of nomadic tribes, leading to a complex and unstable situation. The Egyptian authorities struggled to maintain control and collect tribute, often resorting to force, but ultimately failing to bring peace to the region.

Section section_03 (Chars 16974–25333):
Section Summary: The Egyptian government struggled to maintain control over its vassals in Palestine and Syria, who were often at odds with each other and with the Egyptian authorities. The vassals, such as Aziru and Namjauza, formed alliances with land-seeking plunderers, prolonging and embittering the strife. Meanwhile, the Egyptian king, Akhenaten, received letters from foreign sovereigns, including the Babylonian ruler Kadashman-Bel, who addressed him by his prenomen "Napkhuria" and requested gold and matrimonial alliances. The correspondence between Akhenaten and Kadashman-Bel reveals a complex web of diplomatic relations, with the Egyptian king hesitant to give away his daughters in marriage due to his divine status. The letters also highlight the strained relationships between the Egyptian king and his vassals, as well as with other foreign rulers, such as King Tushratta of Mitani.

Section section_04 (Chars 25334–33516):
Section Summary: The kings of Mitani, including Tushratta, formed alliances with Egypt through marriage and diplomacy to secure their existence. Tushratta's letters to the Egyptian pharaohs, such as Nimmuria, were filled with requests for gold and declarations of affection, but his later letters became increasingly greedy and insincere. The accession of the reforming king Akhenaten, also known as Napkhuria, brought unrest to Egypt's foreign relations, and he adopted an insolent tone in his responses to Tushratta and other foreign leaders. Akhenaten's actions, including neglecting to send sympathy to the Babylonian king Burnaburiash and sending gold to the Assyrian prince Assurnadinakhi, strained Egypt's relationships with other nations. This marked a significant shift in Egypt's foreign policy, as Akhenaten prioritized novelty and demonstrating his power over maintaining traditional alliances and friendships.

Section section_05 (Chars 33517–41746):
Section Summary: The Assyrian king Assuruballit exchanged messengers with the Egyptians, while the Sutu of the desert, possibly instigated by the Babylonians, threatened to kill Egyptians in their territory. A prince of Alashia sent letters to the Egyptian king, discussing commercial matters and mentioning the plague, which had affected his land and hindered copper production. The Hittite king and Tushratta, King of Mitani, also exchanged letters with the Egyptian king, Napkhuria, with Tushratta requesting golden statuettes that had been promised by Napkhuria's father, Nimmuria. Napkhuria sent wooden models instead, leading to a dispute between the two kings. The correspondence ultimately ended with Napkhuria threatening to close his land to Mitani's subjects, and it is likely that all intercourse between the two kingdoms ceased.

Section section_06 (Chars 41747–49782):
Section Summary: The letters from Pharaoh's subordinates reveal a complex web of alliances and rivalries among the vassal chiefs, with Aziru, prefect of the Amorites, being a particularly powerful and troublesome figure. Aziru's expansionist ambitions and alliances with other chiefs and Egyptian officials allowed him to seize control of neighboring territories, prompting complaints from other vassals, such as Rib-Addi of Gebal. Despite his questionable loyalty and conspiring with the Hittite foes of the Egyptian court, Aziru managed to evade punishment for many years, but was eventually summoned to Egypt and arrested. The political activity of Aziru was seen as a stabilizing force by some Syrian and Phoenician princes, who preferred his rule to the chaos and raiding that existed before his rise to power. Ultimately, Aziru's actions led to a significant shift in the balance of power in the region, with some chiefs benefiting from his rule and others suffering as a result of his expansionism.

Section section_07 (Chars 49783–57731):
Section Summary: In the southern region, a leader named Labaya attempted to unite forces against the Egyptian rule, but ultimately failed and was taken captive. Meanwhile, Abdikheba, the captain of Jerusalem, complained of hostilities from neighboring chiefs, including Milki-El and Tagi, who were aided by the Habiri, likely referring to the Hebrews. The Egyptian system of government was blamed for the chaos, as the petty princes received little support or protection from their suzerain. The letters from various princes and officials, including Abi-milki of Tyre, reveal a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and power struggles in the region. These letters also provide valuable insights into the language, culture, and politics of the time, with some expressions and phrases echoing those found in the Hebrew Psalter.

Section section_09 (Chars 65358–70706):
Section Summary: The Tell el Amarna period saw a decline in Egypt's authority in Asia, despite King Napkhuria's religious reform. The Habiri people continued to attack and expand, taking advantage of Egypt's weakness. The kingdom of Mitani, ruled by Tushratta, was also facing decline and eventual fall, with the Hittites and Babylonians waiting to take control. Mitani's king formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, but the kingdom eventually vanished and was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also met a swift end, with Napkhuria's city at Tell el Amarna being razed to the ground after his death in 1370 B.C.
