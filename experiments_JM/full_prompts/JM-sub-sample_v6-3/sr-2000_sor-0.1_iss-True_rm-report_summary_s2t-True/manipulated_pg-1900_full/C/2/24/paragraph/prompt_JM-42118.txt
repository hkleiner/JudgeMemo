3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. He grew up in a romantic and beautiful environment, which later influenced his art. Fragonard's father wanted him to pursue a career in commerce, but he was drawn to art. At 16, he moved to Paris to study art under François Boucher, a renowned painter. Boucher recognized Fragonard's talent and encouraged him to compete for the Prix de Rome, which he won in 1752.

Fragonard then studied under Charles-Joseph Natoire in Rome, where he developed his skills and style. He returned to Paris in 1761 and began to gain recognition as an artist. Fragonard's art was characterized by its elegance, charm, and attention to detail. He became known for his landscapes and decorative paintings, which were highly sought after by the nobility and wealthy merchants.

In 1769, Fragonard married Marie Anne Gérard, and they had two children together. He continued to paint and decorate homes, including the luxurious pavilion of Luciennes for Madame du Barry. Fragonard's art was influenced by the Dutch landscapists, and he incorporated elements of their style into his work. He also excelled in painting miniatures and was known for his ability to capture the beauty of everyday life.

Fragonard's career was marked by his association with the French royal court, particularly during the reign of Louis XV. He was granted a studio and apartments at the Louvre, where he lived with his family. However, with the outbreak of the French Revolution, Fragonard's life and career were disrupted. He was forced to flee Paris and seek refuge in Grasse, where he continued to paint and decorate homes.

Fragonard returned to Paris after the Revolution and attempted to adapt to the new artistic styles and trends. However, he struggled to regain his former success and recognition. He died on August 22, 1806, at the age of 74, and was buried in the cemetery of Montmartre. Fragonard's legacy as an artist was rediscovered in the 19th century, and his work is now considered some of the most beautiful and elegant of the 18th century.

Fragonard's art embodies the spirit of 18th-century France, with its emphasis on elegance, charm, and beauty. His paintings continue to delight and inspire art lovers to this day. Despite the challenges and disruptions he faced during his lifetime, Fragonard remained a prolific and talented artist, leaving behind a legacy of stunning works that continue to be celebrated and admired. His story serves as a testament to the enduring power of art and the human spirit.

Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in the picturesque town surrounded by olive trees and Mediterranean waters, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. However, Fragonard's father had other plans for him, apprenticing him to a notary, but the young man's passion for art led him to pursue his creative interests instead.

Section Summary: In 1749, a 16-year-old Jean-Honoré Fragonard's mother took him to Paris to meet the renowned painter François Boucher, who advised him to train with Jean-Siméon Chardin to master his craft. However, Fragonard made little progress with Chardin and was sent away, prompting him to study the masterpieces in Parisian churches and paint them from memory. After six months, Fragonard returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a student, assigning him to work on decorative cartoons. Fragonard later won the Prix de Rome and went on to study in Rome, where he was influenced by the city's landscapes and colors, rather than its antique masters. Under the guidance of Boucher and with the support of Marquis de Marigny, Fragonard developed his unique style and formed lasting friendships with fellow artists Hubert Robert and Abbé de Saint-Non.

Despite her efforts, Du Barry was eventually banished to a convent after Louis XV's death, and the new king, Louis XVI, reinstated the lettre de cachet. Meanwhile, artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard was at the height of his career, enjoying success and patronage from wealthy supporters like Bergeret de Grandcour, with whom he embarked on a second journey to Italy.
