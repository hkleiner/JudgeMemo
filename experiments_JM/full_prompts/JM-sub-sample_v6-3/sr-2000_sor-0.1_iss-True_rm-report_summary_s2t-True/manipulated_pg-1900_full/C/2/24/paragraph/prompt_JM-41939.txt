You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a French painter born in 1822 to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a painter and drawing master who struggled to make a living. Rosa's mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician who gave up her career to raise their children. Rosa was the first of four children, and her early life was marked by poverty and frequent moves.

Despite the challenges, Rosa's parents encouraged her artistic talents from a young age. She began drawing and painting at the age of four and quickly developed a passion for art. Her father recognized her talent and allowed her to work in his studio, where she would spend hours sketching and painting.

As Rosa grew older, she became increasingly fascinated with animals and the natural world. She spent hours observing and sketching animals, and her parents eventually allowed her to keep a small menagerie in their home. This early exposure to animals would later become a hallmark of her artistic style.

In 1829, the Bonheur family moved to Paris, where Rosa's father hoped to find more opportunities for his art. Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school, where she developed a tomboyish personality and a love of rough-and-tumble play. She also began to develop her artistic skills, spending hours copying the works of the great masters at the Louvre.

Rosa's big break came in 1841, when she submitted two paintings to the Salon, a prestigious art exhibition in Paris. Both paintings were accepted, and Rosa's career as an artist was launched. Over the next several years, she continued to paint and exhibit her work, developing a reputation as a talented and innovative artist.

In 1849, Rosa's father died, and she was forced to take on more responsibility for supporting her family. She began to sell her paintings more widely, and her reputation grew both in France and abroad. She became known for her vivid and realistic depictions of animals, and her paintings were highly prized by collectors and art lovers.

In the 1850s, Rosa's career reached new heights. She was awarded a gold medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and her paintings were exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. She also became known for her eccentric personality and her love of animals, which she kept in a large menagerie at her home.

Despite her success, Rosa's personal life was marked by tragedy. Her mother died in 1833, and her father's death in 1849 left her feeling lost and alone. She also struggled with the pressures of fame and the demands of her patrons, who often requested specific types of paintings.

In the 1860s, Rosa's career continued to flourish. She was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and her paintings were exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. She also became known for her generosity and kindness, particularly to her friends and fellow artists.

Rosa's later years were marked by a series of personal tragedies, including the death of her beloved friend and companion, Nathalie Micas. She also struggled with the loss of her creative energy and the pressures of old age. Despite these challenges, she continued to paint and exhibit her work, producing some of her most beautiful and enduring paintings in her final years.

Rosa Bonheur died on May 25, 1899, at the age of 77. Her funeral was attended by thousands of people, and she was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Her legacy as an artist and a woman of great talent and determination has endured for generations, and her paintings continue to be celebrated and admired around the world.
