2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violin maker who lives with his nephew Davy. Anthony's mother had been a widow, and he was her only son. He hated school and was considered lazy, but he had a passion for music and the outdoors. Anthony spent most of his childhood taking apart and reassembling musical instruments, and by the time he was 15, he had fixed every accordion, guitar, and fiddle in the village.

As Anthony grew older, he became more skilled at his craft, and people began to recognize his talent. He even got to work on a valuable violin that had been bought in Berlin 70 years earlier. Anthony's life took a turn when his neighbor, Mrs. Butterfield, died, and her niece Lyddy Ann inherited her house and property. Lyddy was a recluse who had been disfigured in a fire as a child and had spent most of her life alone.

Despite her initial reluctance, Lyddy began to open up to Anthony and Davy, and the three formed a close bond. Lyddy would often listen to Anthony play his violin, and the music brought her joy and comfort. When Davy fell ill, Lyddy took care of him, and Anthony was grateful for her help. As they spent more time together, Anthony and Lyddy developed feelings for each other, and Anthony eventually proposed to her.

Lyddy was hesitant at first, fearing that Anthony would not love her if he could see her scarred face. However, Anthony reassured her that his blindness allowed him to see her true beauty, and they got married. The story jumps forward in time, and we see Anthony and Lyddy sitting in their apple orchard, surrounded by beauty and music. Anthony is working on a new composition, using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs to create music.

Davy, who is now older, is asked to interpret the music, and he describes it as the song of the green things growing in the orchard. Lyddy is happy and fulfilled, and the story ends on a peaceful note, with Anthony and Lyddy embracing and surrounded by the beauty of nature. Throughout the story, the author highlights the themes of music, beauty, and the power of human connection to overcome adversity. The characters of Anthony and Lyddy are well-developed, and their relationship is portrayed as a deep and abiding one. The story is a heartwarming tale of love and redemption, set against the backdrop of a small village and the beauty of nature.
