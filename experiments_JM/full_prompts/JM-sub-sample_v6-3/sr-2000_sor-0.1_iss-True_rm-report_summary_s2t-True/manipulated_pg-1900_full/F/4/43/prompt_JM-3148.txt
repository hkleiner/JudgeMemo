    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violinist who lives with his nephew Davy. Anthony is a skilled musician who can play beautifully, but his blindness makes everyday tasks challenging. Davy reads to Anthony from an instruction book, and they discuss music and life. Anthony's past is revealed, showing his struggles in school and his passion for music. He was a curious and wondering child, always asking questions and seeking answers.

As Anthony grew older, he became skilled in repairing musical instruments, and people would bring him their broken instruments to fix. He also made his own instruments, including a violin. Anthony's life changed when his neighbor, Mrs. Butterfield, died, and her niece Lyddy Ann inherited her property. Lyddy was a recluse who had been disfigured in a fire as a child and had lived a solitary life.

Aunt Hitty, a nosy and opinionated woman, took charge of Mrs. Butterfield's funeral and was pleased to have the opportunity to plan a grand ceremony. After the funeral, Lyddy settled into her new life, and Anthony would often play his violin in the evenings, which Lyddy would listen to from a distance. One day, Lyddy's turkey wandered into Anthony's yard, and she met him while trying to catch it. Anthony was struggling to care for his sick nephew, and Lyddy offered to help.

As Lyddy spent more time with Anthony and Davy, she found herself opening up and sharing her thoughts and feelings with them. Anthony, being blind, did not judge her by her appearance, and Lyddy felt seen and heard for the first time in her life. The three formed a close bond, and Lyddy would often visit and help with household chores. Anthony's music brought joy and comfort to Lyddy, and she found herself feeling alive and happy for the first time in years.

As the days turned into weeks, Lyddy and Anthony grew closer, and their friendship blossomed into romance. Anthony proposed to Lyddy, and she accepted, despite her initial hesitation due to her disfigurement. The two got married, and Lyddy found happiness and fulfillment in her new life with Anthony and Davy. The story concludes with the three sitting in the apple orchard, surrounded by nature's beauty, and Anthony playing his violin, which Lyddy and Davy interpret as a dream of the future and a celebration of new life and beauty.

Section Summary: The village where Anthony Croft lived disapproved of his love for the violin, with some people associating it with dancing and dissipation. Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins.

Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. As Anthony delved deeper into his craft, he became inspired by the poetry of Emerson and the legacy of Antonio Stradivari, striving to create perfect violins that would bring beauty and music to the world.
