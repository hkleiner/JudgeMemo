# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reign of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets were letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters revealed the difficulties of the script and language, with scribes using Babylonian mythological texts to improve their fluency.

The tablets also showed that the Egyptian kings, particularly Amenophis III, had a warlike spirit, but this ceased with the accession of Amenophis IV, who introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion. The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was built, and the royal court was moved from Thebes. The officials who accepted the new doctrine were regarded as deserving men, and Ai, a secretary of state, received golden honors.

The tablets also contained letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters revealed the diplomatic relations between Egypt and other kingdoms, with discussions of marriage alliances, gifts, and trade. The letters also showed the struggles of the Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, with complaints of attacks by the Habiri and other tribes.

The tablets provided valuable information about the history of civilization, including the political conditions of the Tell el Amarna period. The Egyptian system of government was criticized for its weakness, and the petty princes were often at odds with each other. The tablets also mentioned the Hittites, who were pressing forward from Asia Minor into Syria, and the kingdom of Mitani, which was nearing its fall.

The letters from the Asiatic vassals, including Aziru, Rib-Addi, and Abdi-kheba, revealed the struggles of these officials to maintain their power and position. The tablets also contained letters from women, including the daughter of Napkhuria, who was married to Burnaburiash. The tablets provided a unique insight into the politics, culture, and society of the ancient Near East during the 14th century BC.

The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has been significant for the study of ancient history, providing a wealth of information about the diplomatic relations, political conditions, and cultural practices of the time. The tablets have also shed light on the history of the Hebrews, who were already present in the "Promised Land" during this period. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource, offering a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of ancient Near Eastern politics and society.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8551):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, finding extensive ruins and a well-preserved city plan. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The two pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna period, Amenophis III and IV, belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had expanded Egypt's borders through conquests, but under these kings, the focus shifted from war to other pursuits, including a religious reform introduced by Amenophis IV.

Section section_02 (Chars 8551–17090):
Section Summary: King Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new religious doctrine that emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, "Aten", and sought to reduce the influence of the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes. The king's efforts were met with resistance, leading to open strife and the eventual removal of the court to a new city, Akhet-Aten. The new doctrine was not widely accepted, and many officials and vassals continued to refer to the old gods, with some even correcting the king's new name to reflect the old religion. The Asiatic provinces, which enjoyed self-government under Egyptian supremacy, were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute disputes, and the immigration of Bedawìn tribes, leading to a state of chaos and instability. The king's attempts to maintain control and collect tribute were often unsuccessful, and the region was marked by constant struggles and alliances between various chiefs and tribes.

Section section_03 (Chars 17091–25414):
Section Summary: In Palestine, the Habiri's actions led to unrest and opportunities for ambitious vassals to establish independent kingdoms, taking advantage of the Egyptian government's distance and perceived weakness. The Egyptian government, despite being well-informed, took a middle course of sending small, inadequate military expeditions, which sometimes restored temporary peace but ultimately failed to check serious hostilities. The letters from Asian kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relations, with the Egyptian king being reluctant to give away daughters in marriage due to their perceived divine status. These letters also show that the Egyptian king's claims to divine honors caused difficulties in diplomatic intercourse, with other kings like Kadashman-Bel appreciating and mocking this weakness. The correspondence between Egyptian kings and their Asian counterparts, such as Kadashman-Bel and King Tushratta of Mitani, provides valuable insights into the politics and diplomacy of the time.

Section section_04 (Chars 25415–33603):
Section Summary: Tushratta, the king of Mitani, wrote to Nimmuria, the king of Egypt, describing his difficulties in ascending to the throne and his military victories. Tushratta's letters to Nimmuria were initially respectful and affectionate, but later became filled with requests for gold, revealing his greedy nature. After Nimmuria's death, Tushratta's relationship with the new Egyptian king, Akhenaten (also known as Napkhuria), deteriorated due to Akhenaten's insolent tone and neglect of traditional diplomatic etiquette. Akhenaten's actions also strained Egypt's relationships with other kingdoms, including Babylonia, which led to retaliatory measures and a decline in diplomatic relations. The section highlights the complexities and challenges of ancient diplomatic relationships, marked by shifting alliances, power struggles, and personal rivalries.

Section section_05 (Chars 33603–41817):
Section Summary: A prince from Alashia wrote to an Egyptian king, discussing trade and commerce, and also mentioned the plague that had affected his land. In contrast, the king of Mitani, Tushratta, exchanged letters with the Egyptian king Napkhuria, discussing a promise of golden statuettes that Napkhuria's father had made. Tushratta was insistent on receiving the statuettes, but Napkhuria sent wooden models instead, leading to a dispute between the two kings. The letters also reveal the characters of the two monarchs, with Tushratta being persistent and Napkhuria being evasive. The section also mentions letters from Egyptian vassals and officials in Western Asia, who wrote to the king with reports and announcements, using a formal and humble tone.

Section section_06 (Chars 41818–49801):
Section Summary: The Tell el Amarna archives provide a unique store of historical material, revealing the doings of vassal chiefs and their interactions with the Egyptian court. Aziru, prefect of the land of the Amorites, was a particularly powerful and troublesome chief who sought to found an independent kingdom by seizing territories from neighboring chiefs. Despite complaints from other chiefs, such as Rib-Addi of Gebal, Aziru was able to evade punishment and even conspired with the Hittite foes of the Egyptian court. Eventually, Aziru was summoned to the Egyptian court and arrested, but his rise to power had brought a measure of stability to the region, ending a period of lawlessness and petty raids by smaller chiefs. The archives reveal the complex and often tumultuous relationships between the Egyptian court and its vassal chiefs in the region.

Section Summary: Abdikheba, the captain of Jerusalem, wrote to the king about the threats he faced from his opponents, including Milki-El and Tagi, who were recruiting troops from the Habiri, likely referring to the Hebrews. Abdikheba's letters, along with those of Milki-El and Tagi, complained about the struggles they faced and the lack of support from the Egyptian government. The Egyptian system of government was criticized for its ineffectiveness in addressing the issues in Canaan, with King Burnaburiash complaining about the plundering of a Babylonian trading company. The letters also revealed the complex relationships between the various princes and officials in Canaan, with some, like Abi-milki of Tyre, skilled in lodging complaints and seeking favor with the king. The tablets provided valuable insights into the history of the region, including the presence of the Hebrews in the "Promised Land" before they had firmly established themselves.

Section section_09 (Chars 65313–70239):
Section Summary: The daughter of Napkhuria sent a letter to her father via a special envoy, but unfortunately, the letter is mostly illegible. During the Tell el Amarna period, Egypt's authority in Asia was weakened, despite King Napkhuria's religious reform, and the Habiri people continued to attack and expand their territory. The kingdom of Mitani, which was a major power in Western Asia, was on the verge of collapse and was eventually overtaken by the Hittites and Assyria. The Mitani kingdom was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms, and its eastern boundary was seized by Assyria, marking the beginning of Assyria's rise to power. Meanwhile, in Egypt, the XVIIIth Dynasty came to an end, and the city of Tell el Amarna was destroyed by the champions of Amon after Napkhuria's death in 1370 B.C.
