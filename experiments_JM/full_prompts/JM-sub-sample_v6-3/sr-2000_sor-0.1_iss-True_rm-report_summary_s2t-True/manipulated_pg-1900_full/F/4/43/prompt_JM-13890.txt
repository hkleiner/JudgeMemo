    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before him, and when he didn't, his shrine was destroyed and his name was erased from records. However, this didn't mark the end of pilgrimages to Canterbury, as a new wave of enthusiasm for the site emerged in the 20th century. Many modern pilgrims take the train to Canterbury, but those who walk the old Pilgrims' Way from Winchester are rewarded with a more gradual and rich unfolding of the city's story. The city of Canterbury has a long history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, which they called Durovernum, and later became an important center for the Anglo-Saxons. The city's strategic location at the junction of several Roman roads made it an ideal capital for the kingdom of Kent, and it has remained a significant place in English history ever since.

Section Summary: Ethelbert, the King of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine and his missionaries arrived in Canterbury, and Ethelbert allowed them to preach and instruct, leading to the conversion of many Saxons, including the king himself. The city became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The early Christian churches in Canterbury, including St. Martin's and St. Augustine's, played a significant role in the Christianization of England, with Augustine dedicating a temple to St. Pancras and building a church dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. Despite being attacked and damaged by the Danes in 1011, Canterbury continued to grow and prosper, with its cathedral and churches remaining an important part of English history and Christianity.

Section section_03 (Chars 17133–25816):
Section Summary: After the Norman Conquest, a fire destroyed the Saxon cathedral in Canterbury, and Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, rebuilt it in the Norman style. The new cathedral, completed in 1077, included a crypt under the choir, a feature inspired by the original Saxon church. Over the years, the cathedral underwent several changes, including the construction of a new Norman choir by Prior Ernulph, which was consecrated in 1130. In 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in the cathedral by four knights, an event that was a culmination of his long-standing conflict with King Henry II.

Section section_04 (Chars 25817–34521):
Section Summary: Archbishop Thomas Becket defied the King's authority, leading to a confrontation with four knights who ultimately killed him in Canterbury Cathedral. The murder sparked widespread outrage and Becket was quickly revered as a saint, with his blood and relics believed to have healing properties. King Henry II, who had inadvertently provoked the murder, performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and receiving corporal punishment from bishops and monks to atone for his role in Becket's death. The event transformed Canterbury into a major pilgrimage site, with thousands of people flocking to the city to visit Becket's tomb and seek healing. Becket's martyrdom and the King's penance cemented his status as a saint, and he became one of the most revered figures in medieval Europe.

Section Summary: The city of Canterbury was a major pilgrimage site, with vast crowds of people visiting the Cathedral to see the shrine of Thomas Becket.

The Cathedral was further modified over the centuries, with additions and renovations made in the 13th to 15th centuries, including the construction of a new shrine for Becket's remains. The city's importance as a pilgrimage site and its role as a center of ecclesiastical power helped it maintain its wealth and influence, even as it began to decline after the dissolution of the monasteries.
