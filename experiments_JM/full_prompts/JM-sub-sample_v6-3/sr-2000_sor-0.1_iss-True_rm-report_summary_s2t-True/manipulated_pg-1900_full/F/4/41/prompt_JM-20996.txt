You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_05 (Chars 34565–43113):
Section Summary: The city of Manila is a place of beauty and improvement, but it is also expensive to live there, especially when it comes to food, which is often shipped from distant ports. In contrast, life in the quiet hamlets of the distant islands is one of harmless inactivity, where people live simple lives with little trouble or effort. The traditional Filipino home is characterized by a unique arrangement of furniture, with a large mirror, settee, and chairs, which allows for face-to-face conversation and a glimpse of the young ladies in the mirror. The lifestyle of Filipinos varies greatly depending on their wealth, with the rich enjoying polished floors, abundant food, and a large household of dependents, while the poor, known as the "tao", live simple lives with limited food and resources. Overall, life in the Philippines is marked by two extremes: the active, progressive life of the city and the inactive, traditional life of the rural areas.

Section Summary: The writer visited a leper colony in the Philippines, initially encountering a hostile reception from a group of men armed with bolos, but later successfully visiting the colony with guides and interpreters. The colony was a small community of people suffering from leprosy, living in grass huts and struggling with the disease, yet still experiencing human emotions like love and joy. In a separate incident, the writer joined a group of American soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening a nearby town. The pursuit took them through rugged terrain, including volcanic slag and tropical jungles, and highlighted the contrast between the primitive Filipino guards and the modern American soldiers. Ultimately, the ladrones escaped, and the pursuit was unsuccessful, but the experience showcased the challenges and complexities of life in the Philippines during that time.

Section Summary: The group had been marching for about 20 miles, and the pedagogues' feet were severely blistered. A native was hired to transport them in his cart, pulled by a carabao, so they could return to their post. To ensure their safety, they initially planned to stay awake, but eventually fell asleep, trusting the driver to alert them in case of danger. They slept soundly despite the rough ride and woke up to the blistering tropical sun. Upon awakening, they approached a village where they procured ponies to take them back to their post.
