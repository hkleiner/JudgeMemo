# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 597, Augustine landed on the island of Ebbsfleet and began to preach and instruct the people of Canterbury. The city became a major center of Christianity in England, and the Cathedral was built. In 1170, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered in the Cathedral, leading to a wave of pilgrims visiting the city. The pilgrims' way from Winchester to Canterbury became a popular route, and the city prospered.

The Cathedral was rebuilt and expanded over the centuries, with various architects and builders contributing to its design. The Trinity Chapel, where Becket's shrine was located, is a notable feature of the Cathedral. The chapel contains a mosaic pavement, tombs of notable figures, and stunning stained-glass windows. The city of Canterbury is still surrounded by its medieval walls, with the West Gate being the only remaining gate.

The city has a number of historic buildings, including St. Martin's Church, which is one of the oldest churches in England. The church is believed to have been built on the site of a Roman church, and its font is thought to be a relic of Saxon times. The city is also home to St. Augustine's Abbey, which was founded by Augustine in 597. The abbey was converted into a palace after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and was later restored and converted into a missionary college.

Canterbury has a number of other historic sites, including the Castle, which features a great Norman keep, and the remains of the Black and Grey Friars' buildings. The city also has a number of interesting churches, hospitals, and old inns. The city's museum is also worth visiting, with its collection of artifacts and exhibits on the city's history. Despite the passage of time, Canterbury remains a city steeped in history and tradition, with its medieval architecture and historic sites continuing to attract visitors from around the world.

The Cathedral's history is closely tied to the city's, with the two being inextricably linked. The Cathedral has undergone numerous changes and expansions over the centuries, with various styles and architectures being represented. The building is a testament to the city's rich history and its importance as a center of Christianity. The city's walls and gates, although not all remaining, are still an impressive feature of the city's landscape.

Overall, Canterbury is a city with a rich and varied history, from its early beginnings as a Roman settlement to its current status as a thriving city with a strong sense of tradition and heritage. The city's historic sites, including the Cathedral, St. Martin's Church, and St. Augustine's Abbey, are a major part of its appeal, and its medieval architecture and charming streets make it a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims alike.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear before him, despite Becket having been dead for 368 years. The writ ultimately led to the destruction of Becket's shrine and the erasure of his name from records, marking the end of the first phase of Canterbury pilgrimages. However, a new wave of enthusiasm for the site has emerged, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, some of whom take the traditional Pilgrims' Way from Winchester, while others use the railway. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors drawn to its historic cathedral and surrounding landscape.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–16859):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and captured by the Danes, who killed many Saxons, including Archbishop Alphege, and burnt the cathedral.

Section Summary: The body of Archbishop Alphege was brought back to Canterbury from London by King Canute, who made amends for the devastation caused by his people. The Saxon cathedral was later destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in the Norman style by Archbishop Lanfranc. The new cathedral was further modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Thomas Becket, who was killed by four knights on December 29. The events leading up to Becket's murder, including his return from exile and his confrontation with the four knights, are a pivotal part of Canterbury's history.

Section section_04 (Chars 25079–33275):
Section Summary: Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered by four knights in the cathedral after a heated argument. Despite being aware of the danger, Becket refused to take any measures to ensure his safety, and the knights ultimately killed him with several sword strokes. After his death, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, with the discovery of his hair-cloth shirt and the presence of vermin on his body being seen as evidence of his austerity and devotion. The news of his martyrdom sparked a wave of pilgrims to Canterbury, and his relics were highly sought after for their perceived healing properties. King Henry II, who had been implicated in Becket's death, later performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and shedding tears at Becket's tomb.

Section section_05 (Chars 33276–42065):
Section Summary: After King Henry II's penance for the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, the Cathedral of Canterbury became a major pilgrimage site, attracting vast crowds and wealth. A fire in 1174 damaged the cathedral, and it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, which combined Romanesque and Gothic elements. The shrine of Becket was completed in 1220, and its translation was a grand ceremony attended by Henry III and many ecclesiastical dignitaries. Over the centuries, the cathedral underwent further changes, including the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style, and it remained a major center of the English Church. Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of Becket's shrine, Canterbury continued to thrive as a city and a center of ecclesiastical authority.

Section section_07 (Chars 50388–58854):
Section Summary: The Cathedral's vast nave, with its cool, greenish light, is a magnificent vestibule to the rest of the building, and its emptiness is a stark contrast to the vibrant colors and ornaments that once filled the space. The building's architecture, including the supporting arch and the western screen, showcases the skill and simplicity of its design. The Cathedral is home to numerous monuments and tombs, including those of notable figures such as Dean Farrar, Orlando Gibbons, and the Black Prince, whose tomb is a magnificent piece of work with intricate details. The Trinity Chapel, where the shrine of St. Thomas once stood, is now an empty space, but the site still holds significant historical and cultural importance. The chapel is also the final resting place of King Henry IV and his wife, Joan of Navarre, and features a beautiful thirteenth-century mosaic pavement.

Section section_08 (Chars 58854–67491):
Section Summary: The eastern extension of the Canterbury Cathedral chapel, known as Becket's Crown, contains a chair made of Purbeck marble where Archbishops are enthroned. The Trinity Chapel features a remarkable series of 13th-century stained glass windows that depict the miracles of St. Thomas, which are some of the finest examples of their kind in England. The city of Canterbury still retains much of its medieval charm, with its old walls and narrow streets, despite the destruction of many of its historic gates and buildings over the years. The city's West Gate is one of the few remaining gates, and it was nearly demolished in the 19th century to make way for a circus procession. The nearby St. Augustine's Abbey, founded by Augustine in the 6th century, has been restored and now serves as a missionary college, preserving its historic significance and association with the early days of Christianity in England.

The remains of lesser-known religious houses, hospitals, and churches, such as the Black Friars and Grey Friars, can also be found. Several hospitals, including St. John the Baptist and Eastbridge Hospital, are located within the city, while the old Hospital of St. Nicholas, a former leper hospital, is situated outside the city. The city's churches, with the exception of All Saints' in High Street, are also worth visiting, with St. Dunstan's being a notable example due to its connection to Sir Thomas More.
