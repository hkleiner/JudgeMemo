# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author embarked on an expedition to study the Sarö Yögurs, a Turkish tribe living in the Gobi Desert. They started their journey from the Chinese town of Chin-t'a and traveled southeast, passing through a temple and a wall that formerly enclosed the oasis. The author met three women from the Sarö Yögur tribe, who wore a unique costume and were proud to identify themselves as Sarö Yögurs.

The author visited the village of Machuangtzu, where they met the lamas and were welcomed into their homes. The lamas were surprised by the author's intrusion, but eventually, they became hospitable and talkative. The author learned about the tribe's customs, including their marriage and death rituals. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, and their main source of livelihood is grazing cattle.

The author also visited the Shera Yögurs, another Turkish tribe living in the mountains. They traveled to the village of Kanchenp'u and then to the monastery of K'anglungssu, where they met the t'umu, the hereditary governor of the Shera Yögurs. The author learned about the tribe's history, customs, and way of life. The Shera Yögurs are also a pastoral people, and they live in tents made of coarse canvas-like material.

The author observed that the Shera Yögurs are of medium height, with well-formed hands and feet, and narrow wrists and ankles. They have a unique costume, which includes a sheepskin coat and a hat made of stiff canvas. The author also learned about the tribe's social structure, including their system of relationship between different "bones" or clans.

The Shera Yögurs have a rich cultural heritage, including their music and dance. The author attended a feast, where they sang beautiful melodies and offered cups of hot brandy to the guests. The author also learned about the tribe's struggles, including their loss of cattle during the Dungan revolt and their current economic difficulties.

The author spent several days with the Shera Yögurs, learning about their way of life and customs. They observed that the tribe is quick at their work, talkative, and amusing, and that they have a strong sense of community. The author also noted that the tribe has a unique system of governance, with the t'umu serving as the head of the tribe.

The author's journey with the Shera Yögurs came to an end, and they bid farewell to their hosts. They traveled back to the town of Li-yen, where they were welcomed by the friendly old mandarin. The author reflected on their experience with the Shera Yögurs, noting that they had learned much about the tribe's culture and way of life.

The author's expedition provided valuable insights into the lives of the Sarö and Shera Yögurs, two Turkish tribes living in the Gobi Desert and the mountains. The author's observations and notes provide a unique glimpse into the culture, customs, and way of life of these tribes. The author's experience with the Shera Yögurs was particularly memorable, and they were impressed by the tribe's hospitality and generosity.

The author's journey also highlighted the challenges faced by the Shera Yögurs, including their economic difficulties and their struggles to maintain their cultural heritage. The author noted that the tribe's population is declining, and that they are at risk of losing their unique culture and way of life. The author's expedition served as a reminder of the importance of preserving cultural heritage and supporting minority communities.

Overall, the author's expedition was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into the lives of two unique Turkish tribes. The author's observations and notes will serve as a valuable resource for future researchers and scholars, and will help to promote a greater understanding of the culture and customs of the Sarö and Shera Yögurs.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8332):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating the village boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their houses were built in Chinese style, with only a few being considered poor.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and use Chinese household utensils. Their clothing is a mix of Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men wearing long coats and fur hats, and women wearing distinctive head dresses decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Sarö Yögur are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and tea made with salt and butter. They appear to be in straitened circumstances, with limited economic resources and a lack of energy and enthusiasm, but their condition is not considered extremely poor compared to other parts of Central Asia. Physically, the Sarö Yögur have prominent cheek bones, short and broad faces, and small eyes, with some individuals having distinctive nose shapes.

Section section_04 (Chars 24840–32983):
Section Summary: The author set out on an excursion to visit the Shera Yögur Prince, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, and was struck by the lama's small pony that could keep pace with the author's larger horse. The author then prepared for a visit to the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author began their journey, crossing the river Heiho and navigating a stony and icy ravine, where they encountered Chinese workers harvesting trees and donkey caravans. After passing a guardhouse and a small Chinese homestead, the author arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, which was surrounded by small hills and featured a large, colorful temple. The monastery was a collection of buildings, including a temple and dozens of houses, mostly low and unpretentious, nestled on the lower slopes of the hills.

The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading services. The author eventually left the monastery, saying goodbye to the lamas and departing with the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo, as their guide.

Section Summary: The author describes the appearance and demeanor of the lamas, who wear red mantles and have expressive faces. The author then recounts their journey to the residence of the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs, which is a simple wooden house with a few huts. The Shera Yögurs inhabit the mountains surrounding several rivers, are governed by a system of t'umus, and have a traditional way of life with no written laws. The origin of the tribe is unclear, but they believe they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi, and they consider themselves to be Mongolian and related to the Sarö Yögurs. The t'umu complains about the arbitrariness and extortion of the Chinese officials, who have reduced the number of horses they levy from the tribe and are now disputing the payment of rental for coal-shafts.

Section Summary: The Yögurs, a tribe in China, were originally inhabited by the Hung maotzu or Huang fan, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors. The current Yögur population is a remnant of six families sent to the area by the Chinese government, and they are considered a kind of irregular troop. The tribe has diminished in size due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element, with women outnumbering men and many families having few or no children. The Yögurs have a unique system of "bones" or family divisions, which determines relationships and marriage eligibility, and they follow traditional customs such as leaving the dead to be eaten by birds of prey and arranging marriages through negotiation and payment. The tribe's administrative division and social practices, including marriage and inheritance customs, are also influenced by Chinese and Buddhist traditions.

The Yögurs live in simple, low tents made of a coarse canvas-like material, furnished with basic household items and heated by a fire. Their livestock, including yak cows, sheep, and horses, are well-suited to the mountainous environment, but the Yögurs have struggled to regain prosperity after suffering losses during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs also have a spiritual side, gathering to chant prayers at "praying places" in the mountains, particularly to honor the cattle god and ensure the health and welfare of their animals.
