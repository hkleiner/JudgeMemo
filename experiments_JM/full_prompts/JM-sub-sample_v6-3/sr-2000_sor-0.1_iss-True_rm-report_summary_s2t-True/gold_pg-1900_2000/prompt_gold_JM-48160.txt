You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author is writing about her experiences in France during World War I. France is divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author wants to visit the war zone, but it's difficult to get permission. She tries to meet with members of the middle class, but they are suspicious and proud. 

The author decides to focus on her work, visiting base hospitals and writing about the war effort. She meets with a duchess who has turned her castle into a hospital and is connected to the Military Hospital Service Board. The duchess helps the author get an interview with a high-ranking official, who agrees to help her get permission to visit the front lines.

However, the process is slow, and the author has to wait nearly a month. She finally receives a note from the Ministry of War asking for her photographs and signature. She is then summoned to the office of the Service de Santé, where she meets with charming officials who tell her she can visit Rouen and Meaux. 

The author is disappointed, as she wants to visit the front lines, not just tourist areas. She asks to go to Amiens, but is told it's too close to the big guns. She makes a list of other places she'd like to visit, including Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc. The officials agree to help her, and she receives a carnet rouge, a precious little red book with blank permits.

The author visits Meaux with a French friend, where they see the battlefield of the Marne. They visit cemeteries, trenches, and ruined buildings, and meet with the Mayor, who tells them about the village's experiences during the war. A few days later, the author is summoned again to the Ministry of War, where she is given permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc.

The officials are polite and helpful, but the author is still frustrated that she can't get closer to the front lines. She decides to make the most of her trip and visits the stations, where she sees hundreds of soldiers traveling. She observes the officers on her train, noting their height and demeanor. The author reflects on the uniqueness of her experience and the comforts of Paris, which seem far removed from the war. 

Despite the challenges, the author is determined to see and hear something of the war effort. She is obliged to travel alone, but is excited for the adventure. The stations are crowded with soldiers, and the author wonders if the whole front is on vacation. The soldiers travel in large numbers, and the author is struck by their health and contentment. 

The author's trip is an opportunity for her to observe the war effort up close and to write about her experiences. She is grateful for the help of the officials and the duchess, who have made her trip possible. The author's story provides a unique perspective on life in France during World War I, highlighting the challenges and complexities of the war effort. 

The author's experiences are marked by frustration and disappointment, but also by determination and curiosity. She is driven to see and understand the war effort, and her story provides a fascinating glimpse into life in France during this time. The author's writing is engaging and descriptive, bringing the reader into the world of the war zone. 

Overall, the author's story is one of adventure, curiosity, and determination. She faces challenges and obstacles, but perseveres in her quest to understand the war effort. Her experiences provide a unique perspective on life in France during World War I, and her writing brings the reader into the world of the war zone.

She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, where she witnesses the impressive and somber sight of the battlefield of the Marne, with its many graves and cemeteries. The author's goal of reaching the front lines, such as Amiens or Verdun, remains elusive due to the restrictions and dangers of the war zone.
