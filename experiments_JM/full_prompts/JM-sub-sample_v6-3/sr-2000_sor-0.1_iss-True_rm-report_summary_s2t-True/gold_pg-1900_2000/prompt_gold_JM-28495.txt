You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, taking a tram to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs. They want to buy a dog, but not an expensive one with a pedigree. Stella suggests going to the Home for Lost Dogs, where they can get a dog for five shillings. The conductor on the tram teases them about getting off at the "Home for Lost Dawgs."

When they arrive in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but they don't know where it is. The narrator is reluctant to ask for directions, but Stella suggests asking a little boy on the street. However, the boy plays a trick on them, telling them to "bite a policeman" to get to the Home.

The narrator and Stella then spot a man wearing a uniform with the words "Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs" on his hat. They decide to follow him, hoping he will lead them to the Home. However, they end up in a series of awkward and humorous misadventures, including following the man into a public house and then losing him.

As they continue to follow the man, they become more and more exhausted. The man eventually leads them on a wild goose chase, running through the streets and finally disappearing into a villa. The narrator and Stella are left alone, feeling foolish and frustrated.

As they walk home, Stella is clearly upset and doesn't want to talk about the experience. The narrator tries to reassure her and suggests advertising for a dog instead. However, Stella is still shaken and doesn't want to see a dog again. As they walk across the golf course, Stella suddenly grabs the narrator's arm and points to something, but it's not clear what it is.

The narrator is concerned about Stella's state of mind and tries to comfort her. He asks if she's tired or shaken, but she denies it. The story ends with a sense of uncertainty and anticipation, as the narrator and Stella continue their walk home. The experience at the Home for Lost Dogs has clearly been a disaster, and it's not clear what will happen next. The narrator's attempt to buy a dog has been a failure, and Stella is still reeling from the experience. The story is a humorous and lighthearted tale of a couple's misadventures in London.
