You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change and transformation in England. Each generation tends to reject the values and ideas of the previous one, and this was particularly true during the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, brought about rapid changes in technology, economy, and society. The French Revolution also had a profound impact on England, leading to a period of reaction and counter-reaction.

The pendulum of history swings back and forth, with each movement generating a counter-movement. This can be seen in the rise and fall of empires, the growth and decline of ideologies, and the evolution of social and political systems. The 19th century was a time of great upheaval, with the old order being challenged and a new social order being built.

Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a relatively stable and prosperous country, with a strong aristocracy and a largely rural population. The aristocracy was highly cultivated and played a significant role in shaping the country's culture and politics. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent wars led to a period of panic and reaction, which delayed the implementation of democratic reforms.

The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in the economy and society, including the growth of cities and the development of new industries. However, it also led to the exploitation of workers, poverty, and social unrest. The condition of the working class during this period was often dire, with many people living in poverty and squalor.

The war with France had a profound impact on England, leading to a period of isolationism and a decline in the country's intellectual and cultural connections with Europe. However, it also stimulated the growth of nationalism and patriotism, which would shape the country's politics and culture for centuries to come.

The early 19th century was a time of great literary and artistic achievement, with writers such as Byron, Wordsworth, and Jane Austen producing some of their most famous works. However, it was also a time of great social and economic change, with the growth of cities and the development of new industries leading to the exploitation of workers and the growth of poverty.

The government faced significant challenges in responding to these changes, including the need to address poverty, inequality, and social unrest. The famous system of doles, which provided financial assistance to the poor, was introduced during this period, but it had the unintended consequence of pauperizing the rural laborer and encouraging large families.

The economists of the time, such as Malthus, pointed out that over-population was a major cause of poverty and social unrest. However, they failed to recognize that over-population was often the result of a low standard of civilization, rather than a lack of food or resources. The introduction of new technologies and industries, such as the railways and the textile industry, helped to stimulate economic growth and improve living standards.

Despite the challenges and difficulties of the time, the Victorian Age was also a period of great progress and achievement. The country experienced rapid economic growth, and the standard of living improved significantly. The dominions beyond the seas were being peopled and consolidated, and education, liberty, and democracy were advancing. The Victorian Age was a time of great change and transformation, and its legacy continues to shape our world today.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9120):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which broke the continuity between the old order and the new. The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a self-contained village system, a sparse population, and a genuine aristocracy that held political power. The French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and kindled patriotism in various countries, including England, which became more isolated from European thought during the early part of Victoria's reign. This era of rapid change and transformation had a profound impact on English society, paving the way for the development of a new social order.

Section section_02 (Chars 9121–13017):
Section Summary: The war did not significantly disrupt the intellectual life of the country, with notable literary figures like Scott, Wordsworth, and Jane Austen continuing to produce great works. In contrast, the condition of the working class was very bad, with poverty, illiteracy, and poor living conditions prevalent. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises, which were exacerbated by over-population and a low standard of civilization. Despite these difficulties, the country experienced rapid progress in the first half of the reign, with improvements in education, liberty, and economic growth. This progress was marked by a sense of complacency, with many writers and thinkers of the time celebrating the country's advancements and optimistic about its future.
