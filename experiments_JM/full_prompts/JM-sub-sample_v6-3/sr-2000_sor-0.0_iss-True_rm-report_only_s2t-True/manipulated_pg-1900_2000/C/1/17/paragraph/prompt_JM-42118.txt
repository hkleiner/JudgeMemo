You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7637):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. The town of Grasse was a quiet and isolated place, far removed from the fashionable and scandalous world of Paris. As a young boy, Fragonard was exposed to gossip and news of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour as the king's mistress and her influence on the arts. However, Fragonard's father had other plans for him, apprenticing him to a notary at the age of 15, but the boy's passion for art led him to idle and eventually pursue his creative interests. Fragonard's early life in Grasse and his introduction to the world of art set the stage for his future as a renowned painter.

Section section_02 (Chars 7637–12637):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to pursue a career in art. She introduced him to the renowned painter Boucher, who eventually took him under his wing after initial rejections from other artists, including Chardin. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's skills improved significantly, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." Fragonard then studied at the king's school and continued to work in Boucher's studio, producing notable works such as "Blind Man's Buff." During this time, he also came under the patronage of the Marquis de Marigny, the brother of the influential Madame Pompadour.
