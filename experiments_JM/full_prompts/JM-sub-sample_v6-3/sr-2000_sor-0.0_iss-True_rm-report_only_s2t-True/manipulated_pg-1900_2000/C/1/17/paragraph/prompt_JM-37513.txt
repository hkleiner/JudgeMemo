You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8927):
Section Summary: The author's interest in science and philosophy was sparked by reading Tyndall's Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination, which introduced them to the concept of evolution. They were later introduced to Herbert Spencer's works, which further shaped their understanding of evolution and the natural world. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the concept of differentiation, where simple things become more complex, and the idea that every active force produces more than one change. The author notes that Spencer's philosophy had a wide range of applications, from biology to social and political developments, and that he is known for his concept of the universality of law and universal causation. Overall, Spencer's work had a significant impact on the author's understanding of the world and the natural sciences.
Scores:

        • Abrupt jumps between ideas
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Disconnected paragraphs
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear transitions between sections

Section section_02 (Chars 8928–10389):
Section Summary: The author discusses Spencer's interpretation of the world, which aims to unify all knowledge and explain all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force. This approach encompasses biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and seeks to interpret mental evolution in terms of physical processes. The author acknowledges the challenge of explaining the mind, but suggests that it can be understood as a product of nervous evolution and ultimately reducible to molecular oscillations. The relationship between mind and matter is seen as fundamental, with each being understandable only in terms of the other. Ultimately, the author concludes that while the mystery of existence may be baffling, it can be accepted and even rejoiced in.
