You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8566):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets were found to be from the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from Asiatic invaders and expanded its kingdom into Asia and Nubia. Amenophis IV introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, moving towards monotheism and worship of the sun disk, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes. The discovery of the tablets has provided valuable insights into the history and administration of Ancient Egypt during this period.

Section section_02 (Chars 8567–12958):
Section Summary: The Egyptian king changed his name to "Akhen-Aten" and introduced a new religion, with his courtiers and family members also adopting names related to the sun god Aten. The new capital, "Akhet-Aten", was built and consecrated, and the queen-mother Teye showed respect to her son's new beliefs by visiting the city. In contrast, the working class in England during the early 19th century faced extreme poverty and hardship, with many being illiterate and inarticulate. The government struggled to address these issues, implementing flawed solutions such as the system of doles, which ultimately worsened the situation. Meanwhile, in Paris, a young girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was born, destined to play a significant role in French history.
