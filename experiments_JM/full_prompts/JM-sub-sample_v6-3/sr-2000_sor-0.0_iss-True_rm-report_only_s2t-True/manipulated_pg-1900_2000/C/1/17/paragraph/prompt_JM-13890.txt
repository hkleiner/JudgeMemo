You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8587):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ of summons to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, and subsequently had his shrine forfeited to the Crown and his name erased from records. The year 1538 marked the last pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr. The city of Canterbury has a rich history, dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with evidence of Roman invasions and settlements, including the town of Durovernum, which was an important center for trade and commerce. The Romans left a lasting legacy in Canterbury, with many of their buildings, roads, and artifacts still visible today. The city's history is a complex and fascinating one, with many different cultures and influences shaping its development over the centuries.

Section section_02 (Chars 8588–12819):
Section Summary: The section begins by mentioning the Universal House of Justice and the confidence of Bahá'ís in the future of the planet, but then shifts to a historical account of the Christianization of England. In 597, Augustine landed in England and began to preach and instruct the locals, with the support of King Ethelbert, who eventually converted to Christianity. The city of Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The church of St. Martin's, where Augustine and his monks began to preach, is considered one of the oldest Christian churches in England, with some historians believing it may date back to the Roman period. Despite some uncertainty about its exact origins, St. Martin's remains a significant historical site and an important part of England's Christian heritage.
