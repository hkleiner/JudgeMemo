You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8629):
Section Summary: The introduction to Meissonier's life and work highlights his commitment to accurately depicting reality, as seen in his insistence on painting from life rather than memory. This approach is exemplified in an anecdote where he observes a squadron of cuirassiers with Colonel Dupressoir, demonstrating his attention to detail and dedication to capturing the truth of a scene. Meissonier was born in 1815 in Lyons, France, and grew up in a family that valued art, with his mother being a talented painter on porcelain and miniatures. He began drawing at a young age and showed a natural talent, but his father, a dealer in colonial products, initially discouraged his artistic pursuits, instead encouraging him to become a druggist's apprentice. Meissonier's early life and training ultimately led him to develop a unique style and approach to art, one that emphasized precision and realism.

Section section_02 (Chars 8630–14036):
Section Summary: The section discusses the early life and career of a painter, likely Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, who was born with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense. His father, Nicolas Boucher, was a mediocre artist who recognized his own limitations and sent his son to study with a great painter, Lemoyne. Meissonier's early career was marked by poverty and struggle, but he was eventually able to exhibit his work and gain recognition from editors and art publishers. Despite initial rejections, Meissonier persevered and eventually found success, with his first exhibition taking place at the age of 16. His early work showed promise, with qualities of relief and realism that would become hallmarks of his later productions.
