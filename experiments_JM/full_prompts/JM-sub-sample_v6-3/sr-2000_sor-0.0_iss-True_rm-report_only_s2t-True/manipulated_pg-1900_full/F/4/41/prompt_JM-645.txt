You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7709):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for the periodical "The Middle". Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although he is tempted to do so. Lady Jane eventually brings up the review at tea, and the narrator is relieved that she is praising it, which may help to impress Vereker.

Section section_02 (Chars 7709–15627):
Section Summary: Lady Jane shares a review of Hugh Vereker's work with him, marking the parts where the author has captured his essence. However, when asked about the review at dinner, Vereker dismisses it as "the usual twaddle," which hurts the author's feelings. Later, Vereker apologizes for his thoughtless comment, explaining that he rarely reads reviews and that even the most intelligent ones, like the author's, miss the true point of his work. He reveals that he feels like a failure because his work is consistently misunderstood, even by clever critics. Vereker's kind and sincere apology makes a strong impression on the author, who is touched by his willingness to connect and share his true feelings.

Section section_03 (Chars 15627–23206):
Section Summary: The narrator is having a conversation with Vereker, an author, about a "little point" that Vereker has written his books for. Vereker explains that this point is the central idea or passion that drives his writing, and that it is subtly woven throughout his works. He claims that critics have failed to notice this idea, and that it is the key to understanding his writing. The narrator is intrigued and asks Vereker for a clue, but Vereker refuses to give a direct answer, saying that the clue is hidden in plain sight in his writing. The conversation ends with the narrator determined to figure out Vereker's secret, and Vereker seeming to enjoy the challenge he has presented.

Section section_04 (Chars 23206–30910):
Section Summary: The narrator had a conversation with Hugh Vereker, who hinted at a "buried treasure" or a hidden meaning in his writing, but refused to elaborate. The narrator became obsessed with uncovering this meaning, but ultimately failed and found that his search had ruined his enjoyment of Vereker's books. He shared his experience with George Corvick, who was intrigued and determined to uncover the secret, and planned to investigate further. Vereker later wrote to the narrator, asking him not to share the secret, but it was too late, as the narrator had already told Corvick. Corvick's pursuit of the secret, possibly aided by his love interest Gwendolen, may ultimately lead to a breakthrough, which Vereker seems to find intriguing.

Section section_05 (Chars 30910–38711):
Section Summary: The narrator visits Vereker, who advises him to give up his pursuit of understanding the author's secret meaning, but the narrator senses that Vereker is being evasive and indifferent. The narrator then discusses his conversation with George Corvick, who is determined to uncover Vereker's secret with the help of his partner, Gwendolen. Corvick and Gwendolen are deeply invested in the mystery and plan to re-read Vereker's works from the beginning to uncover the hidden meaning. The narrator is skeptical of their efforts, but acknowledges that Corvick has a special aptitude for subtlety and may eventually succeed where he failed. As Corvick and Gwendolen delve deeper into the mystery, the narrator becomes increasingly uneasy, sensing that Corvick may ultimately uncover the truth.

Section Summary: The narrator had lost touch with George Corvick, but learned that he had taken on a new project as a "special commissioner" to India, which might be connected to his desire to marry Gwendolen Erme. However, Corvick revealed that he was no longer engaged to Gwendolen, and the narrator inferred that she might have estranged him. Meanwhile, the narrator's curiosity about Vereker's secret had been rekindled, and he was eager to learn more. Gwendolen sent the narrator a telegram with news that Corvick had discovered Vereker's secret, as indicated by a cable from Bombay with the message "Eureka. Immense." The narrator was excited but also disappointed that the telegram didn't reveal what the secret was, and he had to wait for Corvick to write and share more information.

George sends a telegram saying he wants to see their reactions when he reveals the secret, and then writes a letter to Gwendolen saying he will tell her everything after they are married. Gwendolen is thrilled and reveals that she is engaged to George, which surprises the narrator as he had been told the opposite. The narrator is disappointed by the delay in learning the secret and is concerned that George may impose conditions on him as well. Gwendolen is radiant and assured of her future with George, who is staying with Vereker in Rapallo to discuss his discovery.

The narrator, still seeking the truth about Vereker's work, asks Gwendolen if Corvick had completed the article, but she replies that only a few promising pages were written before his death.
