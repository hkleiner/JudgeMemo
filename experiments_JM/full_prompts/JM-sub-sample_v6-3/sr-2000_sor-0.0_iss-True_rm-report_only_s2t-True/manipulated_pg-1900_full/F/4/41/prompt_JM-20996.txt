You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8771):
Section Summary: The author recounts their experience as part of a historic movement in which the US government sent 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands on July 23, 1901. The group set sail from San Francisco on the US Army Transport "Thomas" and traveled to the Philippines, stopping at Honolulu along the way. During their stop in Honolulu, they visited notable sites such as the Pali, a gigantic precipice, and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology, which houses a collection of artifacts illustrating Polynesian life and customs. After crossing the International Date Line, the group lost a day and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs of the native people. The author describes the rough waters of Manila Bay and the unique attire and habits of the native women they encountered.

Section section_02 (Chars 8771–17436):
Section Summary: The author and other teachers arrived in Manila during the rainy season and were struck by the city's cosmopolitan atmosphere and bustling streets. After a two-week stay, they received a notice to prepare for assignment to remote stations, which caused consternation and led to a mass meeting and a petition for aid. The teachers eventually agreed to proceed to their stations, reassured that the authorities would take necessary actions. The author then traveled to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros, where they arrived by ship and were struck by the town's remote and unassuming appearance. As they entered the town, they witnessed the departure of troops and the beginning of a new era of peace, with the author and other teachers representing the incoming reign of education and development.

Section section_03 (Chars 17436–26030):
Section Summary: The scene describes the emotional departure of troops from their loved ones, with women showing intense grief and desperation as they bid farewell to their husbands. The narrative then shifts to the arrival of American teachers in the Philippines, specifically in the town of Bacalod, where they are tasked with establishing a public school system. The teachers face challenges such as lack of infrastructure and supplies, but they persevere and eventually establish schools in towns like Talisay, where they introduce the English language as the basis of instruction. The teachers also participate in social events, including a "baile" hosted by the town of Silay, where they interact with the local elite and struggle to communicate due to language barriers. Despite these challenges, the teachers make progress in establishing a new education system in the Philippines.

Section section_04 (Chars 26030–34565):
Section Summary: The author describes a social gathering in the Philippines, where they struggled to follow the traditional Filipino dance, the "rigodon", but enjoyed the waltz that followed. The event showcased the wealth and fashion of the Filipino people, with many women wearing diamond brooches and rings, and men dressed in formal attire. The author also shares their experience of house-keeping in the Philippines, where they employed several servants, but found it challenging to manage due to the complex system of dependents. Life in the Philippines, particularly in Manila, is dependent on a complex commerce system, with many goods imported from around the world. Overall, life in Manila is pleasant but expensive, with a refined and high-society culture.

Section section_05 (Chars 34565–43113):
Section Summary: The city of Manila is a place of beauty and improvement, but it is also expensive to live there, especially when it comes to food, which is often shipped from distant ports. In contrast, life in the quiet hamlets of the distant islands is one of harmless inactivity, where people live simple lives with little trouble or effort. The traditional Filipino home is characterized by a unique arrangement of furniture, with a large mirror, settee, and chairs, which allows for face-to-face conversation and a glimpse of the young ladies in the mirror. The lifestyle of Filipinos varies greatly depending on their wealth, with the rich enjoying polished floors, abundant food, and a large household of dependents, while the poor, known as the "tao", live simple lives with limited food and resources. Overall, life in the Philippines is marked by two extremes: the active, progressive life of the city and the inactive, traditional life of the rural areas.

Section section_06 (Chars 43113–51574):
Section Summary: The writer visited a leper colony in the Philippines, initially encountering a hostile reception from a group of men armed with bolos, but later successfully visiting the colony with guides and interpreters. The colony was a small community of people suffering from leprosy, living in grass huts and struggling with the disease, yet still experiencing human emotions like love and joy. In a separate incident, the writer joined a group of American soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening a nearby town. The pursuit took them through rugged terrain, including volcanic slag and tropical jungles, and highlighted the contrast between the primitive Filipino guards and the modern American soldiers. Ultimately, the ladrones escaped, and the pursuit was unsuccessful, but the experience showcased the challenges and complexities of life in the Philippines during that time.

Section section_07 (Chars 51575–53313):
Section Summary: The group had been marching for about 20 miles, and the pedagogues' feet were severely blistered. A native was hired to transport them in his cart, pulled by a carabao, so they could return to their post. To ensure their safety, they initially planned to stay awake, but eventually fell asleep, trusting the driver to alert them in case of danger. They slept soundly despite the rough ride and woke up to the blistering tropical sun. Upon awakening, they approached a village where they procured ponies to take them back to their post.
