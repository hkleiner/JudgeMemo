You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7800):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for literature and is not made by mere possession of books. The author illustrates this point with an anecdote about a wealthy man who owns an impressive library, but is not a bookman because he values the books for their monetary worth rather than their literary value. In contrast, a colonial squatter who requests books and shows a natural appreciation for classics like Shakespeare and Milton is considered a true bookman, despite his lack of formal education. The author concludes that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between good and bad literature, and values books for their inherent worth, rather than their external trappings.

Section section_02 (Chars 7800–15864):
Section Summary: The passage describes a bookman who values literature that stands the test of time, such as "Mark Rutherford", over popular but fleeting novels. He believes that a true classic is one that has wisdom, a timeless style, and can be revisited multiple times, much like a cathedral that towers above other buildings. The bookman has a diverse taste in literature, enjoying essays, histories, and novels, and is particularly fond of authors like Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey. He values literature that is well-written, thought-provoking, and honest, regardless of the subject matter or the author's reputation. Ultimately, the bookman's love for literature is driven by a desire to connect with the thoughts and experiences of others, and to find joy and inspiration in the written word.

Section section_03 (Chars 15864–23559):
Section Summary: The author reminisces about their childhood love for adventure stories, such as "Robinson Crusoe" and "Pilgrim's Progress", and later for trapper stories and novels like "Rifle Rangers" and "Monte Christo". As they grew older, they discovered the works of Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, which became the foundation of their literary tastes. The author holds these classic authors in high esteem, returning to their works again and again for sheer pleasure, and considers them superior to modern novels with a purpose. They also praise Balzac as a master of French literature and the founder of the realistic school. The author's love for classic literature is evident in their fond memories of reading and re-reading these beloved books, which continue to bring them joy and comfort.

Section section_04 (Chars 23559–31058):
Section Summary: The passage describes the power of Sir Walter Scott's writing, particularly in his book "The Heart of Midlothian", which portrays a vivid and intense scene of lynch law in old Edinburgh. The heroine, Jeanie Deans, is considered one of the strongest women in Scott's gallery, embodying the sober, strong, and passionate nature of the Scottish people. The author also discusses the joy of rearranging books on a shelf, comparing it to a form of spring cleaning, and how it brings back memories and delight. The bookman's ideal holiday is to spend a week in their own library, surrounded by books and a beautiful garden, with no distractions or obligations. The passage concludes by imagining a meeting of bookmen, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and a Bishop of Durham, who share a passion for books and learning.

Section section_05 (Chars 31058–38996):
Section Summary: The author imagines a gathering of book lovers, including historical figures like the Duke of Roxburghe and Charles Lamb, and Mary Queen of Scots, who was known for her impressive book collection. The author notes that the love of books can be hereditary, with children often inheriting their parents' passion for reading and collecting. A father with a book obsession can "inoculate" his son with the same disease, passing on his love of books and creating a lifelong passion. The author humorously compares book collecting to a disease, suggesting that it can be incurable and lead to financial struggles, with the sufferer's wife often being the one to encourage moderation. Ultimately, the author pokes fun at the idea of trying to cure a book lover of their obsession, suggesting that total abstinence may be the only solution.

Section section_06 (Chars 38996–46845):
Section Summary: The bookman's obsession with collecting books is a disease that consumes him, causing him to make sacrifices and tell lies to obtain the books he desires. Despite the negative impact on his family, he justifies his actions by believing that his collection will be a valuable legacy for his sons. The bookman finds solace and comfort in the company of his books, which provide him with a constant source of pleasure and satisfaction, regardless of the weather or circumstances. His love for books allows him to escape the worries of life and connect with great writers and characters, making him feel independent and content. As he grows old, the bookman is grateful for the joy that books bring him, and he pities those who do not have this same retreat from the weariness of life.
