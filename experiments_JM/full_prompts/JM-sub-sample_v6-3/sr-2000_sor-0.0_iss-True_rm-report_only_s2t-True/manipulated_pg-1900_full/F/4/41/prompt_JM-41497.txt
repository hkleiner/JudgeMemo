You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8535):
Section Summary: Joshua Reynolds was a talented and determined individual who was born with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career as a painter. He was not a genius, but rather a clever young man who worked hard to develop his skills, and his time in Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, was instrumental in his development as a portrait painter. Reynolds' experiences in Italy, particularly his exposure to the works of Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens, had a profound influence on his technique and style. He became a leading figure in the art world, playing a key role in the establishment of the Royal Academy, and his paintings continue to be celebrated for their masterful use of color and composition. Through his work and his teachings, Reynolds left a lasting legacy in the art world, and his influence can still be seen today.

Section section_02 (Chars 8536–17050):
Section Summary: After returning from a holiday, Sir Joshua Reynolds opened a studio in St. Martin's Street and quickly gained success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. He later moved to Leicester Square, where he lived for the remainder of his life, and became a prominent figure in society, associating with notable individuals such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Despite having some personal flaws, including snobbery and jealousy, Reynolds was able to conquer his weaknesses and remain focused on his art, producing high-quality portraits that stood the test of time. He played a significant role in the establishment of the Royal Academy, although he took a diplomatic approach and avoided involvement in the initial intrigues. Ultimately, Reynolds' dedication to his craft and his ability to balance his artistic pursuits with his social life earned him a lasting reputation as one of the greatest British portrait painters.

Section section_03 (Chars 17051–25552):
Section Summary: The Royal Academy was indirectly founded due to the success of the gallery at the Foundling Hospital, which was established by Captain Coram and featured pictures donated by artists such as Hogarth and Reynolds. By 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds had already achieved great success, painting many famous men and women of his time and exhibiting his works at the Society of Artists. He had also become a member of the Dilettanti Society and had developed a strong circle of friends, including Dr. Johnson, with whom he shared a love of literature and art. Reynolds' painting style had matured, but he struggled with the permanence of his colors, which often faded or darkened over time. Despite this, he left a glorious heritage to his country, and his portraits continue to be admired for their optimistic and expressive qualities.

Section section_04 (Chars 25553–34104):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds received the honor of knighthood in 1769, which solidified his social standing, and he subsequently painted fewer portraits, with only 70 recorded in 1771. He became more dignified and urbane, and his reduced output was likely due to his many other duties and interests rather than competition from other artists. Reynolds continued to produce exceptional work, including the notable portrait of the Ladies Horatia, Laura, and Maria Waldegrave, and he visited the Low Countries several times, where he was impressed by the art but surprisingly indifferent to the works of Franz Hals. In his later years, Reynolds sat for a portrait by his rival Gainsborough, but the sitting was cut short, and he went on to paint famous portraits, including one of Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse. Reynolds' artistic legacy endured, with his Discourses remaining relevant and his portraits continuing to be admired, including the beautiful picture of the Duchess of Devonshire and her baby.

Section section_05 (Chars 34105–42729):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' artistic career came to an end when he lost the use of one eye in 1789, and he spent his remaining years preparing for his death. Despite his failing health, Reynolds remained tranquil and continued to work, delivering his final address to students in 1790 and sitting for a portrait by the Swedish artist von Breda. Reynolds' art is still admired today, and his ability to assimilate the styles of other masters, such as Rembrandt and Titian, while maintaining his own unique style, is particularly notable. He was a master of synthesis and analysis, with a keen eye for detail and a ability to diagnose the essence of his subjects. Reynolds' portraits of women, while beautiful, often lacked a sense of humanity, instead emphasizing classical beauty and elegance.

Section section_06 (Chars 42729–47064):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of children and women are often idealized and lack a sense of realism, suggesting that he had no deep interest in them as subjects. In contrast, his portraits of men are masterful and reveal a deep understanding of their characters. Reynolds' ability to capture the essence of his male sitters, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, set him apart from his contemporaries and earned him a reputation as a great painter. Unfortunately, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it difficult to appreciate his work at its best. Despite this, Reynolds' name and fame remain a source of pride in British art and a subject of admiration around the world.
