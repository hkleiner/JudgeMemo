You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8447):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and realistic style, which is exemplified by an anecdote where he had a squadron of cuirassiers ride through a field of grain to study the effects of cavalry on the landscape. Meissonier's artistic career was marked by a devotion to realism, and he never attempted to paint battles because he had never seen one and didn't want to reconstruct it inaccurately. His early life was spent in a humble environment, with his father being a dealer in colonial products and his mother being a fragile woman with an artistic inclination. Meissonier's own artistic talent was evident from a young age, but his father initially tried to discourage him from pursuing a career in art, even going so far as to apprentice him to a druggist.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–16883):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. Despite financial struggles, he continued to work on his craft, eventually exhibiting his work for the first time at the age of 16. Meissonier's big break came when he was commissioned to create illustrations for a publisher, Curmer, and his work on "The Indian Cabin" edition earned him recognition and acclaim. His detailed and realistic drawings showcased his talent, and he went on to illustrate other notable works, including "Frenchmen Painted by Themselves" and "The Fallen Angel". This marked the beginning of his successful career as an artist, and he was no longer in need of soliciting work, with opportunities coming to him instead.

Section section_03 (Chars 16883–25404):
Section Summary: Meissonier experimented with etching, producing a limited number of works that are now highly sought after by collectors.

Meissonier's paintings, often small in scale, were initially met with criticism, but he eventually gained recognition and acclaim, with his work "Monk Consoling a Dying Man" being purchased by the Duke of Orleans.

His small-scale paintings have been defended as a deliberate choice, allowing for a focus on subtle details and expressive physiognomies that draw the viewer in.

Section section_07 (Chars 49183–52681):
Section Summary: Meissonier was a painter who went to great lengths to accurately depict historical scenes, particularly those from the Imperial Epoch. He collected relics and costumes, including a set of Napoleon's trappings and a vast "working library" of clothing and accessories from different eras of French history. Meissonier's attention to detail was meticulous, and he even researched the way linen was cut in the 18th century to achieve greater authenticity in his work. Despite his thorough preparation, he was often dissatisfied with his finished paintings, and on one occasion, he destroyed a piece that others considered perfect. This level of dedication and self-criticism defines Meissonier's talent, glory, and artistic soul.
