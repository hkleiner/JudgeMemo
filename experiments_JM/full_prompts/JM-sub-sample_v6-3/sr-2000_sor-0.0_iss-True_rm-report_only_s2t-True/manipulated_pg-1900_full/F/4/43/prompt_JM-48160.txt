You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8282):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions, but eventually gets help from a duchess who introduces her to a high-ranking official. After a month of waiting, the author receives a carnet rouge, a permit that allows her to visit certain areas, but is initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which are not her desired destinations. She persuades the officials to consider other locations, including Vitry-Bar-Duc and Verdun, but is warned that the latter may be too dangerous. The author ultimately visits Meaux, where she witnesses the devastating aftermath of the Battle of the Marne, including vast fields of graves marked by flags and crosses.

The narrator witnessed the devastation of the war zone, including a bombed train station, and observed the calm and resilience of the soldiers. Eventually, they waited for their train at the station, where they encountered a drunken Algerian soldier who caused a disturbance, but the narrator and others remained unmoved, having become desensitized to the dangers of the war zone.

Section Summary: The author, a woman, was determined to visit the war zone despite the restrictions and dangers. She obtained a military automobile and an American Army officer, Major C., to escort her, and they set out on a four-day trip to visit hospitals and see the war effort firsthand. Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, but the author was not concerned, leaving the responsibility to Major C. and their driver, the Lieutenant. The trip was eventful, with the author seeing thousands of army wagons, artillery pieces, and soldiers, and experiencing the noise and chaos of the war zone. Despite the excitement, the author notes that she seemed to be protected from danger, and her presence appeared to bring a sense of calm, making her feel like a "mascot."

Section section_06 (Chars 41358–49701):
Section Summary: The author traveled through French towns and villages, observing large numbers of soldiers on leave, who were often bored and idle. In contrast, many women and children were working hard in the fields, harvesting crops, with some soldiers also assisting with the harvest. The author noted the stark difference between towns that had been bombed and those that had been spared, and criticized the German army's deliberate destruction of towns and villages during their retreat. The author also met with American women who were working on a project to rebuild destroyed towns and villages, but suggested that the ruins should be left intact as a reminder of the horrors of war. The author reflected on the brutality of war and the prophetic words of Heine, who warned of the ferocity of the German people when unleashed.

Section section_09 (Chars 66377–74850):
Section Summary: The author visited military hospitals in the war zone and saw the need for a supplementary kitchen to provide delicacies, not luxuries, to wounded soldiers. The standard military diet of milk and eggs was not sufficient for many patients, and a private kitchen would allow nurses to provide essential items like broth, sugar, and preserves. The French military discipline is strict, with hospital kitchens closing at 6 PM, leaving patients brought in after hours without sustenance. A private kitchen would enable nurses to provide care and nourishment to patients at any time, potentially saving lives. The author emphasizes the importance of supporting this effort, highlighting the significant contribution that such a kitchen could make to the recovery and well-being of wounded soldiers.

Section Summary: The author visited several hospitals in France, including the Hôpital Central, which was well-organized and clean. The hospital was run by women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who worked tirelessly to care for the wounded soldiers. The author was impressed by the efforts to make the hospital wards more cheerful, with decorations and amenities to boost the morale of the patients. Despite the wealth and generosity of the French people, many are struggling financially due to the war, and the author appeals to Americans to contribute to the relief efforts. The French people are grateful for the support of Americans, and the author hopes that those who can afford to give will respond to the needs of the soldiers and the people of France.
