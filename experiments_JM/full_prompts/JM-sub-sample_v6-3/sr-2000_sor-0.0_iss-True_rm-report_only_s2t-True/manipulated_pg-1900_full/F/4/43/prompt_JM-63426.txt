You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_05 (Chars 33650–42485):
Section Summary: The author developed a love for Caslon typeface and Old English Text, known as Caslon Black, during his early days as a printer. In 1895, he visited the Boston Public Library and discovered the noble ancestry of Caslon through the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience had a profound impact on him, and he became inspired to create typography that was spontaneous and joyful. He later established the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, and began printing with Caslon type, which was initially met with skepticism by other printers. The author's passion for typography and printing led to the creation of unique and beautiful publications, including a Strathmore deckle-edge sample book, which showcased his skill and artistry.

Section Summary: The author was drawn to printing on Strathmore papers due to their unique colors and suitability for Caslon typography, which led to a surge in business and the need for more space and equipment.

Section section_09 (Chars 68842–77585):
Section Summary: The author, Will Bradley, recalls his experience of being recalled from retirement to improve the printing of illustrations for the Hearst organization. He submitted a report suggesting that illustrators simplify their work and focus on dramatic storytelling, but his ideas were deemed too radical at the time. Bradley believes that if his suggestions had been implemented, Hearst's magazines would have led the field in adopting new principles of illustration. He notes that modern illustrators have successfully applied these principles, and he is impressed by their imaginative compositions and masterful use of color. The author also reflects on the opportunities available to young designers and printers today, citing advances in typography, offset printing, and commercial silk-screen printing as creating a new world of possibilities.
