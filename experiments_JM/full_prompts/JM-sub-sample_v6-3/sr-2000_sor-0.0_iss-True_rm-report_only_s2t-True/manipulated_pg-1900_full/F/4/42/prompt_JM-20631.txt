You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8743):
Section Summary: The series of lectures on Hebraic thought and learning was founded in memory of Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar who dedicated his life to promoting Jewish culture and language. Davis's work, including his writings on Hebrew accents and his role in editing the Festival Prayer Book, has contributed to the revival of Hebrew as a living language. The concept of a "Chosen People" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. However, this idea has also been echoed in other cultures, such as Germanism, which has evolved its own doctrine of special election. The lecture series aims to explore Jewish interests and promote a deeper understanding of Hebrew culture and language.

Section section_02 (Chars 8744–16957):
Section Summary: The Bible contains passages that seem to promote violence and superiority, such as the slaughter of surrendered Moabites and the promise of dominance over other nations. However, these passages must be considered in their historical context and interpreted in a comparative manner, taking into account the cultural and social norms of the time. The concept of a Chosen People and other biblical ideas have evolved over time, and Judaism has moved beyond its more primitive stages, incorporating spiritual and ethical developments through the Talmud and other texts. The Jewish tradition has also acknowledged and learned from its past, preserving its history while evolving its beliefs and practices. Ultimately, the Bible's meaning and significance can only be fully understood by considering the complexities of human nature and the historical context in which it was written.

Section section_03 (Chars 16957–25650):
Section Summary: The Old Testament reaches the highest ethical note in literature, emphasizing a universal salvation and a mission to serve humanity. The concept of a "chosen people" in Judaism is often misunderstood, but it actually refers to a people chosen to serve as a "light of the nations" and to bring justice and righteousness to the world. The Old Testament is filled with metaphors and lyrics that express this ideal, such as the "suffering servant" and the "kingdom of priests." The Jewish people's mission is not about self-aggrandizement, but about serving a higher purpose and bringing about a more just and peaceful world. Ultimately, the goal of Judaism is to perfect the world under the Kingdom of God, where all people will call upon His name and Israel will disappear as a distinct entity.

Section section_04 (Chars 25651–33789):
Section Summary: The concept of a "tribal God" in Judaism is misleading, as the God of the Bible is depicted as a universal and righteous ruler from the beginning. The biblical account of Abraham and Moses shows a God who is concerned with justice and morality, and who is willing to listen to human criticism and appeal. The Jewish tradition has always emphasized the universal implications of its religion, and has welcomed proselytes and sought to spread its teachings to all nations. The idea of a chosen people is not about racial or ethnic superiority, but about a shared commitment to a set of values and principles. Throughout Jewish history, there have been many voices that have emphasized the universal and inclusive nature of Judaism, from the Talmud to modern Reform Judaism.

Section section_05 (Chars 33790–42315):
Section Summary: The concept of a "Chosen People" is not unique to the Jewish people, and other nations have also assigned a mission to themselves. The Jewish people's sense of being chosen is rooted in their literature and history, with the idea of a special relationship between God and Israel. This concept is not about arrogance, but rather about a sense of responsibility and noblesse oblige, with the Jewish people feeling honored to promote the "sanctification of the Name" of God. The idea of a nation's mission can be seen in other countries, such as America and England, which have also developed a sense of national self-consciousness and a feeling of being destined for greatness. The development of a national mission is a gradual process that evolves over time, as can be seen in the historical examples of America and England.

Section section_06 (Chars 42315–50837):
Section Summary: The period of English history from the 16th to the 19th centuries was marked by a struggle with France for global dominance, with England emerging as a major power. This era saw the formation of the East India Company, the establishment of colonies in Virginia and New England, and the growth of the British Empire. The concept of a "Chosen People" emerged, with England seeing itself as destined for greatness, and this idea was reflected in literature and poetry, such as Thomson's "Rule, Britannia". However, this notion of a national mission was not always consistent with reality, and was often used to justify expansion and imperialism. The idea of a national mission is not unique to England, and can be seen in other nations, such as Israel, where a sense of purpose and destiny was also developed over time.

Section section_07 (Chars 50837–59276):
Section Summary: The concept of "Germanism is Judaism" is deemed grotesque, as Germanism resembles Judaism only in giving its citizens a sense of belonging to a great historic organism. However, Germany's affinities are more closely aligned with Japan, where individuality is sacrificed to the state. The original mission of Germany, as proclaimed by Fichte, was one of peace and righteousness, but this has been perverted over time, particularly with the influence of industrial prosperity and the glorification of war. In contrast, Jewish literature is characterized by self-criticism and a pursuit of truth, as seen in the Bible's portrayal of Israel as flawed and imperfect. Ultimately, the difference between Judaism and Germanism can be summed up by the concept of "Recessional," where Jewish writers rebuke their nation, while German prophets glorify theirs.

Section section_08 (Chars 59277–67658):
Section Summary: The concept of a nation's right to its territory is often rooted in violence and massacre, but this is often glossed over in national legends. In contrast, the Bible acknowledges the violent history of Israel's occupation of Palestine, and English literature has a tradition of self-criticism and awareness of the flaws of nationalism. The author argues that Judaism has a unique contribution to make to the world, particularly in its emphasis on justice and peace, and that it should not be limited by its past quarrels with Christianity. Instead, Judaism should be open to universalization and reform, and its voice should be heard in the shaping of a new world order. The author urges the Jewish people to choose to be a force for good and to let their light shine, rather than remaining silent and hidden.

Section section_09 (Chars 67659–71212):
Section Summary: The Jewish community is often misunderstood, as they are seen as not contributing to society, but this is because they don't have a unified identity. However, the time has come for Jews to come together and fight for their rights and mission, which is to build a sense of community and connection among nations. Dr. Israel Abrahams paid tribute to the memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar who was self-taught and had a deep love for literature and the liturgy. Arthur Davis' work, particularly his edition of the Festival Prayers, is a testament to his dedication and passion. His legacy lives on through his daughters, who continue his work, and his spirit remains an inspiration to those who knew him.
