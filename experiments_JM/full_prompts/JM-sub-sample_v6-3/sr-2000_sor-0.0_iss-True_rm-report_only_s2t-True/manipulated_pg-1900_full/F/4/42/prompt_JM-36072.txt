You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9119):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which broke the continuity between the old order and the new. The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a stable equilibrium, where the masses had no voice in government but had a stake in the country. The aristocracy held political power and were highly cultivated, enlightened patrons of literature and art. The French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a period of isolation for England, which became more disconnected from European thought and instead turned to Germany for inspiration.

Section section_02 (Chars 9120–18008):
Section Summary: The Napoleonic Wars did not significantly interrupt the intellectual life of England, which saw a surge in great poetry and literary works during that time. In contrast, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and overpopulation being major issues, as highlighted by writers like Byron and Disraeli. Despite the struggles of the poor, the country as a whole experienced significant progress and growth during the first half of the 19th century, leading to a sense of complacency among the upper classes. However, this complacency was met with a violent protest from social critics like Carlyle and Ruskin, who denounced the social and economic conditions of the time and advocated for a return to simpler, more idealistic ways of living. Ruskin, in particular, saw the Industrial Revolution as a blunder and believed that England's true happiness and health could only be achieved by rejecting the values of progress and industrialization.

Section section_03 (Chars 18008–26949):
Section Summary: During Queen Victoria's reign, social reformers like Ruskin and Morris criticized the social and economic systems, despite being beneficiaries of the wealthy elite. The period saw significant improvements in various areas, including the law, universities, and civil service, which were previously plagued by inefficiencies and abuses. The army, however, was in a state of disarray, with poor discipline, brutal treatment of soldiers, and incompetence in leadership, as revealed during the Crimean War. Despite these challenges, the reign saw unprecedented progress in many areas, including finance, education, and science, leading to a sense of optimism and good governance. Overall, while there were still issues, particularly in foreign politics, the period is often regarded as a time of significant improvement and reform in England.

Section section_04 (Chars 26950–35634):
Section Summary: The Opium War and the Crimean War were blunders that damaged Britain's prestige, and the country's foreign policy was marked by jealousy and suspicion, particularly with France. The settlement after 1815 led to the restoration of despotic governments in Europe, and the democratic movements of 1848 were ultimately unsuccessful. Britain's period of prosperity and security during the Victorian era was due to temporary advantages, such as its geographical location and industrial lead, which are now passing. The era also saw significant intellectual and literary movements, including the Romanticist revolution and the emergence of great Victorian writers like Alfred Tennyson. The Victorian era was marked by an unprecedented output of literature and a galaxy of great poets and thinkers, whose legacy continues to be felt today.

Section section_05 (Chars 35635–44250):
Section Summary: Tennyson's writing technique was masterful, and he wrote beautifully about beautiful things, including moral conduct. His work, such as the Idylls of the King, was an allegory that explored themes of ideal manhood and the struggle between sense and soul. Tennyson's poetry reflected his age, with its mix of conservatism and liberalism, and he was concerned about the social and political upheavals of his time, foreseeing many of the evils that would come to pass. He represented the Victorian mood in religion, which was characterized by a distinctively Victorian attitude towards faith, with many intellectuals embracing doubt and questioning traditional dogma. Overall, Tennyson's work continues to offer insights into the human condition, and his poetry remains relevant despite the passing of time.

Section section_06 (Chars 44251–51856):
Section Summary: The Victorian era was a time of great literary and cultural achievement in England, with notable figures such as Tennyson, Dickens, and Thackeray making significant contributions. The era's greatness was due to a combination of transient circumstances, and its decline was marked by the disintegration of society and the rise of antagonistic movements. The fusion of social classes and the growth of industry also had both positive and negative effects, including the creation of a new type of worker who was no longer valued for their craftsmanship. The author believes that the Victorian Age, along with the Elizabethan Age, represents a peak in English civilization, and that the country's grand-scale work on the world stage is likely coming to an end. Ultimately, the author suggests that the future of England depends on the actions of the younger generation, who will shape the country's destiny in the years to come.
