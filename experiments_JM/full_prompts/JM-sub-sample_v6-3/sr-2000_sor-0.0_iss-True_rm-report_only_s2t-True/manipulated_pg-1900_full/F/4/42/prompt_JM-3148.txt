You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8002):
Section Summary: The story begins with a boy named Davy reading to his uncle, Anthony Croft, who is blind. Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his instrument. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he recalls his own childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in the outdoors and in music. Anthony's love for music was evident even as a young boy, when he would create makeshift instruments and hide a precious tuning fork outside the school window to avoid having it confiscated. The scene ends with Anthony playing his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony and beauty.

Section section_02 (Chars 8002–16046):
Section Summary: Tony Croft, a curious and inquisitive boy, was often considered lazy by the villagers because he didn't conform to traditional learning methods. However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. Tony's passion for learning and discovery led him to develop a keen interest in music and instrument-making, and he spent hours taking apart and reassembling instruments to understand how they worked. As he grew older, Tony's skills improved, and he began to earn a little money by repairing instruments for the villagers, although they often undervalued his work. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother, although sometimes perplexed by his behavior, loved and supported him.

Section section_03 (Chars 16046–24363):
Section Summary: The village where Anthony Croft lived disapproved of his love for the violin, with some people associating it with dancing and dissipation. Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins. At the age of 17, he discovered a precious piece of wood from a historic maple tree, which he set aside to use for making a perfect violin in the future. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. As Anthony delved deeper into his craft, he became inspired by the poetry of Emerson and the legacy of Antonio Stradivari, striving to create perfect violins that would bring beauty and music to the world.

As she settled into her new home, Lyddy had few callers, and the community was still getting used to the fact that she was living in the cottage on the river road.
