You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8720):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and military efforts were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan to defeat France quickly was thwarted by Russia's intervention. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was instrumental in the Allied victory, and its contributions should not be underestimated.

Section section_02 (Chars 8720–17605):
Section Summary: The Russian Army's early involvement in World War I, despite being unprepared, played a crucial role in preventing a German victory. By advancing into East Prussia, Russia diverted German troops from the French front, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory in the First Battle of the Marne. German General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to distort this fact, falsely claiming that he defeated a large Russian force with a small German army, when in reality, he had a significant numerical advantage. Ludendorf's own admission that the transfer of German troops to East Prussia had "fatal consequences" for Germany underscores the importance of Russia's actions. Russia's self-sacrifice and efforts during the early years of the war were instrumental in preventing a German victory, and their contributions should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts.

Section section_03 (Chars 17605–26219):
Section Summary: Russia's alliance with France during World War I was driven by a sense of justice and a desire to support the common cause of the Allies. In October and November 1914, Russia's military operations in Galicia, Poland, and East Prussia forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers from the Western front, abandoning their offensive at Ypres and delaying their attack on France for over a year. The Russian Army's efforts compelled the Germans to focus on the Eastern front, restricting their operations in the West to a defensive stance. This strategic shift was a significant turning point in the war, as it prevented the Germans from crushing France and ultimately contributed to their defeat. Russia's sacrifices and military successes played a decisive role in the war, despite being understated by German General Ludendorf in his memoirs.

Section section_04 (Chars 26219–35009):
Section Summary: Russia's military efforts during World War I were hindered by a severe shortage of arms, with some corps having only 1,500 bayonets instead of 40,000. Despite this, the Russian Army played a crucial role in diverting German forces and resources away from the Western front, allowing the Allies to prepare and accumulate new reserves. The Russian front tied up significant German forces, with 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions deployed against Russia in May 1917, compared to only 142 divisions on the Anglo-French front. This diversion of German resources ultimately contributed to the failure of their offensives in France, including the battle of Verdun. The Russian Army's efforts in 1915, although not resulting in decisive victories, prevented the Germans from crushing them and allowed the Allies a year of respite to prepare for future battles.

Section section_05 (Chars 35010–43498):
Section Summary: In 1915, Russia's military efforts helped deprive Germany of a chance to win in France by forcing them to divert troops to the Eastern front. In 1916, Russia launched a crucial offensive, led by General Brusilov, which helped alleviate pressure on Italy and forced Austria to abandon its offensive. This offensive also had a significant impact on the French front, allowing the Allies to launch a successful counterattack at the Somme. Russia continued to provide critical assistance to its allies, including helping to defend Romania from invasion in late 1916. Despite being weakened by revolution and German sabotage in 1917, Russia still managed to tie up significant enemy forces on the Eastern front, preventing them from being deployed elsewhere.

Section section_06 (Chars 43499–52348):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, making tremendous sacrifices with over 12 million casualties, including 3 million killed. The country's efforts diverted German forces, allowing the Allies to prepare and strengthen their armies, and ultimately contributing to the defeat of the Central Powers. Russia's early offensives in East Prussia and Galicia forced Germany to fight on two fronts, rendering their initial war plan useless. Throughout the war, Russia continued to draw enemy forces away from the main front in France, facilitating the Allies' ultimate victory. Russia's sacrifices and contributions were instrumental in the war's outcome, and its role was more significant than that of any other Allied nation.

Section section_07 (Chars 52349–60508):
Section Summary: Russia played a crucial role in World War I, depriving Germany of the possibility of winning and rendering their efforts futile. Russia's enormous sacrifices, including 12 million losses, were instrumental in the war, and without Russia, Germany would have dominated Europe and possibly the world. Despite fighting under extraordinary circumstances with limited resources, the Russian Army was able to defeat the Germans when they had even a small superiority of force. The importance of Russia's role in the war confirms that the country will remain a significant factor in European politics and military equilibrium in the future. Ultimately, the fate of Russia, whether it will be a powerful nation again, will have a significant impact on the balance of power in Europe and the world.
