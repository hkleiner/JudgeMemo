You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8524):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a painter and her mother Sophie Marquis a musician. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After trying various occupations, including dressmaking and school, Rosa's father allowed her to focus on art, and she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which showed promise of her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to art, spending hours copying the works of great masters at the Louvre and embarking on a path to become a successful artist.

In 1848, she achieved complete success, obtaining a first-class medal after exhibiting six paintings and two sculptures, judged by her peers without academic prejudice.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's friend Nathalie provided her with emotional support and helped with her daily needs, allowing her to focus on her art. Despite her success, Rosa continued to study and research, often visiting slaughterhouses and later the horse fair, where she observed and sketched animals. Her paintings, including "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", brought her great recognition and financial success, with "The Horse Fair" being sold to Mr. Gambard for 40,000 francs. The painting had a complex history, with multiple sales and exhibitions, eventually being acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Rosa's success allowed her to build a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which featured a unique courtyard that she transformed into a farm, reflecting her love of animals and the natural world.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's menagerie, which included a variety of animals, was a key part of her artistic inspiration and was housed at her studios in Paris and Chevilly. Her reputation as an artist had spread internationally, with critics praising her ability to capture rural life and the labor of the fields. She traveled to England and Scotland, where she was warmly received and found new inspiration for her work, and later settled at her chateau in By, where she continued to paint with great energy and productivity. Despite her international success, Bonheur's name was not widely known in France until she was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1865, an honor conferred upon her by the Empress herself. Bonheur's work was particularly popular in England and America, where her paintings of rural life were highly valued for their beauty and accuracy.

Section section_05 (Chars 33627–42083):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur visited the Court and was treated with great honor, having conversations with the Emperor and Empress, and taking a gondola ride on the lake with the Empress and the Prince Imperial. She later sent 10 of her works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a second-class medal and was met with coldness from the judges and critics, who resented her long absence from France and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, where she was a demanding but kind teacher, and many of her students went on to have successful careers in painting. After retiring from teaching, she settled at her chateau in By, where she worked tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers, producing many notable works. During the Franco-Prussian War, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism by refusing favors from the Prussian army and instead aided her fellow French citizens who were suffering.

She received the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour from President Carnot, a well-deserved recognition of her contributions to art. Despite her sorrow, Rosa Bonheur continued to produce notable works, including "The Duel" and "The Threshing of the Grain", and formed a new friendship with Miss Anna Klumpke, who would later become her sole testamentary legatee.
