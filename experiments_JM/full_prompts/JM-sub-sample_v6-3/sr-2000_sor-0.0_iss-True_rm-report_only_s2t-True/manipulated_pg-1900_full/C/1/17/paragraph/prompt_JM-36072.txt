You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8888):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which had a profound impact on society. The 18th century, in contrast, was a period of stability, with a genuine aristocracy holding power and cultivating the arts and literature. However, this era was not without its problems, including political corruption and the loss of America, which weakened the aristocratic regime. The French Revolution and subsequent war led to a period of isolation in England, with the country becoming more disconnected from European thought, but also saw a flourishing of great poetry. The early 19th century was a time of great suffering for the working class, with poor conditions that would eventually lead to reforms and changes in the social order.

Section section_02 (Chars 8889–17925):
Section Summary: In 19th century England, there was a stark contrast between the rich and the poor, with the poor living in squalid conditions and being largely illiterate and inarticulate. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises, which led to the implementation of misguided policies that exacerbated the problems. Despite the country's progress and growth during this period, social critics like Disraeli, Carlyle, and Ruskin spoke out against the social ills and injustices of the time, denouncing the effects of industrialization and the mistreatment of the poor. Ruskin, in particular, lamented the loss of beauty and the rise of ugliness in modern towns, which he saw as a symptom of social disease. The problem of addressing the social and economic inequalities of the time remained unsolved, with many of the issues persisting even after some reforms were implemented.

Section section_03 (Chars 17926–26787):
Section Summary: During Queen Victoria's reign, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were reformed, and the Civil Service and Army were improved, although the Army was initially in a state of disarray. The Crimean War exposed the military's incompetence, but the Indian Mutiny was suppressed, and the nation's military credit was partially restored. Despite progress in various areas, including education, science, and finance, foreign politics were marked by blunders, such as the Opium War and the Crimean War, and a prolonged jealousy between England and France. The mid-19th century saw a rise in nationalism and militarism, frustrating England's hopes for a more peaceful and cooperative world. England's prosperity during this time was due to temporary geographical and industrial advantages that would eventually pass to other nations, such as America.

Section section_04 (Chars 26788–35203):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age marked the peak of England's prosperity, but it was also a time of apprehension and uncertainty. The Romantic movement had a significant impact on English literature, producing great poets like Wordsworth and Tennyson, who dominated the literary scene. Tennyson, in particular, is considered the greatest and most representative figure of Victorian literature, known for his perfect technique and beautiful writing about beautiful things. However, his work, especially the Idylls of the King, has been depreciated by modern critics who find his moralism and conservatism outdated. Despite this, Tennyson's poetry remains a testament to his deep-rooted conservatism and reverence for new knowledge, reflecting the complexities and transitions of his age.

Section section_05 (Chars 35204–43976):
Section Summary: The Victorian era, as represented by Tennyson, was marked by a sense of disillusionment and anxiety about the future, with the social order breaking up and progress not always being linear. Tennyson's poetry reflected the mood of the mid-century, with a focus on personal human survival and a willingness to let go of traditional dogmas. The Victorian novel was also a notable achievement, with authors like Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot producing great works, although the quality of fiction declined later in the reign due to the practice of writing hastily for money. The era was characterized by a combination of circumstances that led to its greatness, but also by a disintegration of society and the emergence of antagonistic movements, including theoretical socialism and romantic imperialism. Overall, the Victorian age was a complex and multifaceted period that laid the groundwork for the challenges of the 20th century.

Section section_06 (Chars 43977–46705):
Section Summary: The Victorian era was a time of great social change, with the fusion of social classes proceeding rapidly as the century went on. The alliance between the territorial oligarchs and the commercial class led to the House of Lords becoming a predominantly middle-class body. However, this period also saw the emergence of problems such as parasitism and the dehumanizing effects of industrialization, which threatened the life of civilization. The author believes that the Victorian Age, along with the Elizabethan Age, marks the culmination of English civilization, and that the country's grand scale work is likely nearing its end. The future of England will depend on the actions of the younger generation, as the old Victorians will soon make way for them.
