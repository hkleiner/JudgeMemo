You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8201):
Section Summary: The section begins with a historical account of a military explosion on July 30, but quickly shifts to a nostalgic and introspective tone, describing the magic of Christmas and how it is kept alive by children. The author notes that as adults, people often lose the genuine excitement and joy of Christmas, and instead have to force themselves to feel festive. The author argues that Christmas has lost some of its magic, and that this is a fact that cannot be disputed. The section concludes by suggesting that the decline of Christmas is not just a personal or subjective experience, but rather a broader cultural phenomenon that requires examination and understanding. The author sets the stage for exploring the reasons behind this decline in the next chapter.

Section section_02 (Chars 8202–16541):
Section Summary: The Christmas spirit has diminished among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists who promoted an age of doubt and skepticism. This era of skepticism has led people to abandon faith and enthusiasm, instead embracing a more cynical and rational worldview. However, the author argues that the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas remains intact and is still essential for human dignity and existence. The Christmas feast was fixed on December 25 to coincide with the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and the renewal of hope. Despite the changes in human understanding and knowledge, the fundamental human experience and emotional response to the solstice remains the same, and the Christmas spirit continues to endure.

Section section_03 (Chars 16542–25343):
Section Summary: The importance of goodwill in social existence is emphasized, and it is argued that faith in goodwill is what makes human existence bearable amidst life's mysteries and dangers. A festival, such as Christmas, is necessary to celebrate and foster this faith, as it provides a concrete symbol of the invisible and intangible spirit of goodwill. Christmas, with its traditions and timing, is particularly well-suited to symbolize this spirit, and its customs, such as sending cards and giving presents, can be powerful expressions of sympathy and mutual dependence. However, these customs can be rendered futile by thoughtlessness or negligence, and it is up to individuals to approach them with sincerity and imagination. Ultimately, the festival of Christmas can be a powerful reminder of the importance of goodwill and mutual trust in human relationships.

Section section_04 (Chars 25344–33791):
Section Summary: The author argues that Christmas, when approached with genuine faith and goodwill, can be a powerful and uplifting experience. Despite the potential for excess, the author defends the tradition of feasting and merriment during Christmas, seeing it as a necessary release from the constraints of daily life. The author suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas festival is to focus on cultivating goodwill among people, which is an element of the holiday that remains widely accepted and valued. By concentrating on this aspect, the festival can regain its significance and authenticity without disrupting traditional practices. Ultimately, the author believes that a renewed emphasis on goodwill can bring new life to the Christmas celebration.

Section section_05 (Chars 33791–42508):
Section Summary: The author argues that cultivating goodwill is a personal task that cannot be achieved through societies or grand gestures. Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill in their own heart and towards a small, specific group of people, such as those they interact with daily. The author suggests starting with one person who frequently annoys them, and using imagination to understand and sympathize with that person's feelings and perspective. By doing so, one can increase their goodwill towards that person and ultimately contribute to the greater good. This process requires effort and practice, but can lead to more harmonious relationships and a greater sense of understanding and empathy.

Section section_06 (Chars 42509–51471):
Section Summary: The exercise of imagination about others can lead to goodwill and a decrease in egotism, as it allows for a deeper understanding and sympathy with others. By regularly practicing this exercise, one can develop a more intimate and complete sense of connection with others, leading to a greater interest in their friends and a more genuine sense of celebration during special occasions like Christmas. This discipline can also lead to a greater sense of gratitude and appreciation for the people in one's life, making relationships more meaningful and enjoyable. Ultimately, the practice of sympathetic imagination can transform one's approach to relationships and make Christmas, or the "Feast of St. Friend," a truly special and personal celebration. By cultivating this sense of connection and understanding, one can find greater joy and appreciation in the company of others.

Section section_07 (Chars 51471–60149):
Section Summary: The average successful person often feels unfulfilled and dissatisfied with their life, despite achieving their worldly ambitions. They may feel that striving for more is pointless, but they will continue to do so due to their instinct to strive and improve. The concept of an ideal is unattainable, and the disparity between one's aim and achievement is a natural part of human experience. People will always strive for something more, even if it seems impossible, because it is inherent to human nature to aim high and transcend common sense. Ultimately, the pursuit of perfection is what drives human effort and progress, and a world without challenges or imperfections would be stagnant and unalive.

Section section_08 (Chars 60149–63138):
Section Summary: The average successful person often creates new challenges for themselves after achieving their goals, as they require continual effort and struggle to stay vital. Without this struggle, they may experience spiritual or physical death. True happiness is not found in a future state or environment, but rather in the present moment, through acceptance of life's discontent and a commitment to personal growth. It is the struggle itself that gives life meaning, and the end of struggle is equivalent to death. Ultimately, happiness is found in patience, self-awareness, and the cultivation of positive relationships and experiences, such as those associated with human friendship.
