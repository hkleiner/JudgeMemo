You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among other great artists of his time. His work is characterized by a profound understanding of the struggles and simplicity of rural life, which he experienced firsthand through his own life of struggle and hardship. Millet's paintings, such as "The Angelus," are marked by a sense of earnestness and melancholy truth, capturing the dignity and poverty of peasant life.

Section section_02 (Chars 8701–17403):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's art is characterized by his ability to convey a message, which sets him apart from other painters who may focus solely on technique. To fully appreciate his work, one must be familiar with the countryside he depicted, as the subtleties of atmosphere and line are unique to each region. Millet's paintings often capture the loneliness and simplicity of peasant life, highlighting the importance of their labor and daily struggles. He is more of a philosopher than a painter, using his brush to illustrate the fruits of his observations and convey a deeper meaning. Millet's greatness lies in his ability to portray the human side of rural life, making his paintings more than just technical exercises, but rather a window into the lives of the people he depicted.

Section section_03 (Chars 17404–26366):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged landscape and harsh weather conditions shaping his perspective. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a contemplative disposition, which was encouraged by his family, particularly his father, who recognized his artistic talent. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family supported his artistic pursuits, eventually leading him to meet with a painter in Cherbourg to showcase his work. This marked the beginning of Millet's journey towards becoming a prominent figure in the modern naturalistic school of art.

Section section_04 (Chars 26367–35207):
Section Summary: Millet's artistic talent was recognized by Mouchel, who introduced him to the works of great artists through engravings. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his passion for art led him to eventually return to Cherbourg and study under M. Langlois, a classically trained artist. Langlois, although unable to appreciate Millet's unique style, helped him secure a pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of masters like Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin. In Paris, Millet briefly studied under Delaroche, but found his academic style stifling and eventually struck out on his own, struggling to make a living from his art. Despite the challenges, Millet was determined to develop his own unique style and work towards recognition as an artist.

Section section_05 (Chars 35208–43969):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet struggled to make a living as a painter, often earning very little for his work and relying on the kindness of friends to get by. He eventually found success and a sense of community in Barbizon, where he settled and focused on depicting the lives of peasants. Millet's art was driven by his fascination with the daily struggles and joys of rural life, and he found inspiration in the people and landscapes around him. In contrast to his fellow artist Rousseau, who preferred to paint landscapes and solitude, Millet was drawn to the human aspect of rural life and the stories of the people who worked the land. By living a simple life among the peasants he painted, Millet was able to tap into his creative powers and produce some of his most notable works.

His paintings were initially sold for low prices, but later became highly valued, with "The Angelus" being sold for 800,000 francs. Millet's later years were marked by personal losses, including the death of his friend Rousseau, and declining health, which ultimately led to his death on January 20, 1875.
