You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_02 (Chars 8851–17509):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet was a philosopher-artist who focused on conveying the simplicity and hardships of rural life. His paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen" and "The Sower", showcased the loneliness and monotony of a peasant's labor, but also highlighted the importance of their work. Millet's art was not about technical skill or beauty, but about conveying a message and telling a story. He was more concerned with illustrating the human condition and the struggles of everyday life than with creating visually stunning works. Through his art, Millet aimed to make the viewer forget the painter and absorb the lesson, rather than being impressed by technical skill or artistic virtuosity.

Section section_03 (Chars 17510–26477):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, making it difficult for innovative artists to break through. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Normandy and grew up surrounded by the harsh yet beautiful landscape, which would later influence his art. His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing significant roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, encouraged by his family, and eventually began to pursue art seriously. His early years working on the farm were not wasted, as they honed his observational skills, which would later become a hallmark of his artistic style.

Section section_04 (Chars 26478–35291):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father recognized his son's artistic talent and took him to meet a painter in Cherbourg, where he began to study art. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to support his move to Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre and developed his own unique style. In Paris, Millet briefly studied with Delaroche, but found the experience unsatisfying and eventually struck out on his own, determined to develop his art despite the challenges of poverty and criticism. Freed from the influence of others, Millet was now able to work towards establishing his own artistic identity and achieving recognition.
