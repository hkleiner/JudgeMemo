You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8648):
Section Summary: Joshua Reynolds was a talented and determined individual who was born with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career as a painter. He was not a genius, but rather a clever young man who worked hard to develop his skills, and his time in Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, was instrumental in his development as an artist. Reynolds' experiences in Italy, particularly his study of the works of Michelangelo, Titian, and Tintoretto, had a profound influence on his technique and style. He became a leading figure in the English art world, playing a key role in the establishment of the Royal Academy, and his paintings continue to be celebrated for their beauty and craftsmanship. Through his work and his teachings, Reynolds left a lasting legacy in the art world, and his influence can still be seen today.

Section Summary: After returning from a holiday, Sir Joshua Reynolds opened a studio in St. Martin's Street and quickly gained success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. He later moved to Leicester Square, where he lived for the remainder of his life, and became a prominent figure in society, associating with notable individuals such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Despite having some personal flaws, including snobbery and jealousy, Reynolds was able to conquer his weaknesses and remain focused on his art, producing an impressive output of portraits. He played a significant role in the establishment of the Royal Academy, although he took a diplomatic approach and avoided involvement in the intrigues surrounding its founding.

Section section_03 (Chars 17467–26069):
Section Summary: By 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds had established himself as a prominent painter, having already created many famous works and exhibited at the Society of Artists. He had also expanded his social circle, befriending notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, and had become a member of the Dilettanti Society. Reynolds' painting style had become characterized by strong drawing, firm modeling, and vibrant color, although some of his works were beginning to fade due to his use of impermanent pigments. Despite his success, Reynolds' personal life was marked by a sense of calm and self-control, with no evidence of scandal or intrigue, which has led some biographers to speculate about his relationships, including with the artist Angelica Kaufmann. Overall, Reynolds had built a reputation as a talented and respected artist, leaving a lasting legacy in the art world.

Section section_04 (Chars 26070–34796):
Section Summary: After becoming the President of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds received the honor of knighthood in 1769, which solidified his social standing. He continued to paint, but at a slower pace, producing 70 portraits in 1771, and focused on enjoying life and fulfilling his duties as President. Reynolds traveled to the Low Countries multiple times, where he was exposed to the works of other artists, including Franz Hals, but remained indifferent to their influence. He continued to produce notable works, including portraits of General Oglethorpe, the Ladies Horatia, Laura, and Maria Waldegrave, and Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse. Despite his success, Reynolds had a rivalry with Thomas Gainsborough, and the two artists had a falling out, which was never fully resolved.

Section section_05 (Chars 34796–43475):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' artistic career came to an end when he lost the use of one eye in 1789, and he spent his remaining years preparing for his death. Despite his failing health, Reynolds remained tranquil and delivered his final address to students in 1790, with his last words being about Michelangelo. He passed away in 1792 at the age of 69, and his body was laid to rest in St. Paul's Cathedral. Reynolds' art has stood the test of time, and he is considered one of the greatest portrait painters, with his work continuing to be admired for its beauty and technique. His ability to synthesize and analyze the work of other masters, such as Titian and Rembrandt, helped him develop his own unique style and earn his place among the greatest artists of all time.

Section section_06 (Chars 43476–47398):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children, although beautiful, lack a sense of realism and intimacy, suggesting that he had no deep interest in them as subjects. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' unique vision and comprehensive approach to portraiture set him apart from his contemporaries, making him the leading painter of great men in the 18th century. Unfortunately, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it difficult to appreciate his work in its original form. Despite this, Reynolds' reputation as a master artist remains, and his name is still revered in the art world.
