You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8931):
Section Summary: The author recounts their experience as part of a historic movement in which the US government sent 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands on July 23, 1901. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they witnessed the city's natural beauty and cultural attractions, such as the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. Along the way, they crossed the International Date Line, resulting in the loss of a day, and participated in the traditional "Revels of Neptune" celebration. Upon arriving in Manila, they were introduced to the local culture and people, noting the unique clothing and customs of the native women. The author reflects on the significance of this journey, marking an epoch in history as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to bring benefits to the conquered land.

Section Summary: The author and other teachers arrived in Manila during the rainy season and were struck by the city's cosmopolitan atmosphere and bustling activity. After a two-week stay, they received a notice to prepare for assignment to remote stations, which caused consternation and led to a mass meeting and a petition for aid. The teachers eventually agreed to proceed to their stations, reassured that the authorities would take necessary actions. The author then traveled to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros, where they arrived by ship and took a steam launch to the town, experiencing the local scenery and meeting the outgoing troops who were being replaced by the teachers. The author was struck by the contrast between the outgoing reign of force and the incoming reign of peace, symbolized by the arrival of the teachers.

Section section_04 (Chars 26343–35073):
Section Summary: The author attended a dinner party in the Philippines, where they were served a variety of dishes, including a sweet course called "dulce." After dinner, they participated in traditional Filipino dances, including the "rigodon" and a waltz, although the latter was marked by some awkwardness due to their partner's unfamiliarity with the dance. The author was impressed by the wealth and fashion of the Filipino guests, who wore elaborate clothing and jewelry. In contrast to this luxurious lifestyle, the author notes that everyday life in the Philippines can be challenging, particularly when it comes to managing servants and accessing goods, which often come from distant countries. Overall, life in the Philippines, especially in the city of Manila, is marked by a blend of refinement and difficulty.

Section section_05 (Chars 35073–43779):
Section Summary: Living well in Manila is expensive, as the cost of goods, especially food, is high due to the expense of shipping from other countries. In contrast, life in rural areas is simple and inactive, with people living in a state of harmless inactivity, with little trouble or effort. The traditional Filipino home is characterized by a distinctive arrangement of furniture, with a large mirror, settee, and chairs, which allows for face-to-face conversation and a unique social dynamic. The lifestyle of Filipinos varies greatly depending on their social class, with the rich enjoying a comfortable life with many servants and amenities, while the poor, known as the "tao", live a simple life with limited food and resources. Overall, life in the Philippines is marked by a mix of modernity and tradition, with a strong sense of community and social hierarchy.

Section section_06 (Chars 43780–52371):
Section Summary: The writer embarked on a solo journey to a settlement, despite initial warnings, and was met with hostility by the locals, who were armed with bolos. However, on a second attempt with guides, the writer successfully reached the settlement, which was revealed to be a leper colony, and was met with a heart-wrenching appeal for aid from the residents. The colony was a community of people suffering from leprosy, who despite their condition, lived and loved like anyone else. In a separate incident, the writer joined a group of soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening to sack a nearby town. The pursuit took them through rugged terrain, but ultimately, the ladrones escaped, and the group was left to marvel at the contrast between the primitive Filipino guards and the modern American soldiers.

Section section_07 (Chars 52372–53705):
Section Summary: The travelers had grown tired of hiking and hired a native to drive them in his cart, pulled by a carabao. They lay down in the cart, filled with sugar-cane pulp, and the driver sat on the carabao's back as they headed back to their post. Despite initial concerns about potential danger, they decided to sleep, trusting the driver to wake them if needed, and each kept a revolver in hand. The rough ride didn't disturb their sleep, and they only woke up when the sun was high in the sky, shining down on their faces. Upon waking, they approached a village where they would procure ponies to take them the rest of the way back to the post.
