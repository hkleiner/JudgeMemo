You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8955):
Section Summary: The author recounts how they became a teacher by chance, without a clear aspiration or preparation, and how this was a common experience among their peers.

The second young man's attention to detail and commitment to creating a comfortable learning environment ultimately led to his success and advancement in the field. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with personality being a key factor in inspiring and motivating students. By sharing these experiences, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession.

A superintendent's role involves not only administrative tasks but also being a close student of school costs and planning for the long-term efficiency of the school. By being prepared, organized, and professional, a teacher or superintendent can set themselves up for success and make a positive impact on their students and school community.

Section section_03 (Chars 18385–27722):
Section Summary: The author reflects on the importance of effective teachers' meetings, where tangible and definite suggestions are provided to assist teachers in their work. A successful meeting should be a happy gathering that leaves teachers feeling inspired and motivated, rather than burdened with unnecessary information. The author also highlights the value of personal talks between the superintendent and individual teachers to discuss their progress and challenges. In a separate meeting with the school board, the author presents a detailed report on the school's opening day, which earns them a standing invitation to attend all board meetings and eventually leads to an extension of their authority. This, in turn, enables the author to make more efficient decisions, such as ordering supplies, and ultimately reduces the cost of school supplies.

Section section_04 (Chars 27723–37411):
Section Summary: The author, a superintendent, shares his experiences working with school boards and implementing new ideas, such as manual training and student activities. He found that by presenting well-researched and detailed plans, he was able to gain the board's trust and approval. The author also emphasizes the importance of student activities, such as athletic associations and literary societies, in developing leadership skills and promoting school spirit. However, he notes that these activities must be carefully supervised to ensure they do not become a waste of time. By introducing these activities and promoting school news through local newspapers, the author was able to increase interest in the school and develop a sense of community among students, parents, and teachers.

Section section_05 (Chars 37412–46793):
Section Summary: The school has two types of activities: minor and major. Minor activities, such as clubs, meet informally and require little effort from teachers, while major activities, like sports and school events, are more formal and demanding. These activities help to socialize the school, develop school pride, and teach students to work together towards a common goal. However, they can also be overdone and interfere with academic work, requiring proper direction and management from teachers and the community. Overall, these activities are essential to a vibrant school life and can have a positive impact on students' development, but they need to be balanced with academic responsibilities.

Section section_08 (Chars 64853–70557):
Section Summary: Many high school students today are only able to pursue subjects that will prepare them for industrial or commercial occupations, and schools must provide relevant courses to prevent them from dropping out. The adjustment of students to proper vocations is a significant problem, and schools are using various methods such as vocational guidance departments and student club organizations to address this issue. Some schools have implemented programs where students can learn about different vocations through guest speakers and specialized courses, which has shown to be effective in helping students make informed decisions about their future. To better serve students, schools must study the local industrial and commercial conditions and offer relevant courses, and parents and community members must also be informed about the opportunities available in schools. By making these adjustments, schools can help students adjust to a vocation and prepare them for success in life.
