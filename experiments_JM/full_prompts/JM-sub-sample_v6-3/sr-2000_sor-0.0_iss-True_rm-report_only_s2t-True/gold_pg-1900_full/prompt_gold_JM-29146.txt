You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–16009):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Irwadian Security Police. Symm insults Ramsey and tells him to leave, and when Ramsey refuses, Symm throws a drink in his face. The other outworlders in the hall laugh nervously, and Ramsey is left to decide how to respond to the humiliation. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations of the Irwadian government, which is trying to throw off outworld influence.

Section section_03 (Chars 16010–23577):
Section Summary: Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, is a drunkard who is grossly incompetent, yet he holds a top security job. Ramsey intervenes when Symm mistreats a Vegan girl, and they escape together, with Symm vowing to get revenge. Ramsey takes the girl to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she's letting on, and she's amused by the situation, particularly the Vegan girl's mistaken assumption that she's Ramsey's wife.

Section section_04 (Chars 23578–31621):
Section Summary: Ramsey is approached by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl and tri-di star, who offers him a deal: she'll pay him 1,000 credits to take her through hyper-space to Centauri. Margot had previously been trying to get to Earth, but settles for Centauri after reading Ramsey's mind and discovering he's a fugitive from Earth. Ramsey agrees to take her, on the condition that a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After a night at Margot's apartment, she disappears, locking Ramsey and the Vegan girl inside, and Ramsey finds a cryptic letter in her apartment that hints at a significant discovery related to the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter suggests that the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth may hold the key to understanding how humanoid types emerged simultaneously on thousands of stellar worlds.

Section section_05 (Chars 31622–40030):
Section Summary: A dying man writes a letter to his daughter Margot, revealing his theory about "proto-man," a being who may have originated from hyper-space and populated the galaxy with humans. He believes that whoever discovers proto-man's secret will become incredibly powerful, and he wants Margot to continue his work. Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey and a Vegan girl, Vardin, to escape from Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security. They work on repairing a old spaceship in a junkyard at night, while trying to avoid detection. As they work together, Ramsey finds himself drawn to Margot, but she can read his mind and keeps him at a distance, adding a complicated layer to their relationship.

Garr Symm, a scientist, has discovered something important in Margot's apartment and wants to let the group escape so he can follow them and uncover more information. Chind is instructed to plant a fuel supply, U-235 capsules, in one of the wrecks to aid the group's escape. Meanwhile, Vardin uses a scintillation counter to find the fuel supply, and Margot retrieves it, bringing them one step closer to completing their ship. Garr Symm's ultimate goal is to use the information to make Irwadi the dominant planet in the galaxy, with him as the absolute dictator.

Section section_07 (Chars 48083–56403):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison, Ramsey, and Vardin prepare to depart from Irwadi in their spaceship, the Enterprise, while being watched by Ramar Chind and his crew on the Dog Star. As they enter hyper-space, Ramsey explains the concept of timelessness in this realm, where velocity is felt simultaneously by all parts of the ship and its occupants. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and Ramar Chind track the Enterprise on the Dog Star's radar, which functions perfectly in hyper-space due to the absence of time. The Enterprise encounters eddies or "shoals" in hyper-space, which Ramsey must navigate to stay on course. As they journey through hyper-space, Margot ponders the implications of timelessness on the existence of proto-man, a pre-human ancestor who may still be waiting in a timeless state.

Section section_08 (Chars 56403–64527):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison overpowers Ramsey and forces him to land the Enterprise on a mysterious world in hyper-space. Despite the ship's environment-checker indicating a lethal environment with extreme cold and lack of air, Margot is determined to explore the world, believing it to be the home of proto-man. Ramsey has a realization that the absence of time in hyper-space could protect them from the harsh environment, and Margot intends to test this theory by going outside with Vardin. However, Ramsey refuses to let Vardin go, and Margot threatens him with an m.g. gun, which Ramsey points out is useless in a timeless continuum. Margot ultimately decides to proceed with her plan, despite Ramsey's warnings about tampering with a power beyond human understanding.

Section Summary: Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin venture outside the spaceship, despite initial fears, driven by curiosity. They hear a beautiful, otherworldly music, which Vardin identifies as the "Music of the Spheres," a legend from her home planet of Vega III. As the gray murk surrounding them begins to clear, a black rectangular object, a matter-transmitter, appears, and Margot is drawn to it, realizing its potential to control the galaxy. Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with proto-man, and he tries to stop her from reaching the transmitter, while also fending off Garr Symm's men, who have arrived on the scene. The situation takes a surprising turn when one of the Irwadi men dies after losing his air, despite being on a world where time does not exist and death should not be possible.

Section Summary: Ramsey stops Margot from using the matter-transmission device, and instead, Garr Symm uses it and is transformed into a caveman-like creature. Vardin, a proto-man, reveals that his ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and Ramsey has unknowingly helped him. With Vardin's mission accomplished, he disappears, and Ramsey and Margot return to their ship, the Enterprise, and blast off into space together, ready to start a new life.
