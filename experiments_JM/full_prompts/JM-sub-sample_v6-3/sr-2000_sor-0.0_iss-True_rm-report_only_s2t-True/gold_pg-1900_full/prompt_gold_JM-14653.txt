You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8421):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder and enthusiasm of Christmas, but adults have lost some of that faith and excitement, and now often view the holiday as a time of indulgence and obligation. The author argues that this decline in the significance of Christmas is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied.

Section section_02 (Chars 8421–16867):
Section Summary: The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. As a result, people have lost faith in traditional beliefs and principles, and the qualities associated with faith, like enthusiasm and sentiment, are now undervalued. However, the author argues that the core principles of faith, goodwill, and morality remain intact, and that the Christmas spirit, which embodies these principles, is still essential to human existence. The celebration of Christmas on December 25 was actually influenced by the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which symbolized the triumph of light over darkness and the renewal of hope. Despite the changes brought about by science and modernity, the author believes that the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas will endure.

Section section_03 (Chars 16868–25599):
Section Summary: The value of astronomy lies in its ability to remind us of our shared humanity and the importance of mutual goodwill and trust. Despite differences, people are coming together to promote social justice, which is a testament to the power of faith in goodwill. Celebrating festivals like Christmas is essential to foster and express this faith, as it provides a concrete symbol of our shared values and promotes a sense of community and brotherhood. The traditions and customs of Christmas, such as exchanging gifts and cards, are designed to symbolize the spirit of peace and goodwill, and can be a powerful way to connect with others and express our faith in humanity. By embracing these traditions with sincerity and imagination, we can strengthen our bonds with others and promote a sense of universal goodwill.

Section section_04 (Chars 25600–34046):
Section Summary: The author defends the tradition of feasting during Christmas, arguing that faith and joy are naturally connected to celebration and excess. While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and embrace the ridiculous. The author also argues that attempting to replace traditional festivals with more modern or intellectual celebrations would be unsuccessful, as festivals are affairs of the emotions, not the intellect. To revitalize the Christmas festival, the author suggests focusing on cultivating goodwill among people, which is a unifying element that can bring people together. By doing so, the festival can acquire a fresh significance without overthrown tradition or shocking those who hold dear the older significance.

Section section_05 (Chars 34046–42857):
Section Summary: The author argues that cultivating goodwill towards others is a personal task that cannot be achieved through societies or grand gestures. Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those who annoy or challenge them the most. The key to cultivating goodwill is to use one's imagination to understand and sympathize with others, putting oneself in their shoes and acknowledging their difficulties and good intentions. This effort requires a genuine sacrifice of self and a willingness to listen and understand, rather than just polite phrases or material gifts. By doing so, one can build meaningful relationships and increase goodwill, which is essential for human happiness.

Section section_06 (Chars 42858–51706):
Section Summary: The author discusses the importance of cultivating goodwill towards others through a deliberate and systematic effort of imagination and sympathetic understanding. This exercise, although challenging, can lead to a significant reduction in egotism and a greater sense of connection with others. As a result, one's relationships with friends and acquaintances become more meaningful and interesting, and even everyday interactions, such as gift-giving and celebrations like Christmas, take on a new significance. The author argues that this cultivation of goodwill can ultimately lead to an increase in one's own happiness. By practicing sympathetic imagination, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of others, leading to a more fulfilling and joyful life.

Section section_07 (Chars 51707–60225):
Section Summary: The path to happiness involves cultivating amity, reducing resentment, and maintaining a benevolent attitude towards others. However, after the festive season, a reaction sets in, and people often feel discouraged and dissatisfied with their lives. Despite this, individuals will continue to strive for their goals, driven by instinct and a desire for self-improvement, often making New Year's resolutions to guide their efforts. These resolutions are often ambitious and may ultimately lead to failure, but they are a necessary part of the human experience, driven by an innate desire to strive and improve. Ultimately, people will continue to pursue their ideals, despite the likelihood of failure, because it is an inherent part of their nature.

Section section_08 (Chars 60226–65941):
Section Summary: The concept of evil is not a positive principle, but rather a lack of perfection. Achieving perfection would mean the end of life, as life requires constant development and change. True happiness is not found in a state of equilibrium or the absence of struggle, but rather in the acceptance of discontent as a condition of life and the pursuit of an ideal. Real happiness is an inward state of mind that can be achieved in the present, and it is fueled by the struggle and effort to improve. Ultimately, despite the challenges and disappointments of life, many people find it worth living due to the "golden moments" of triumph, joy, and human connection that make the struggles worthwhile.
