You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8750):
Section Summary: Joshua Reynolds was a talented and determined individual who was destined for success in the art world. Born in 1723, he was apprenticed to a portrait painter and later traveled to Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, including Michelangelo and Titian. This experience had a profound impact on his technique and style, and he returned to England as a portrait painter of the first class. Reynolds' time in Italy and his subsequent success were instrumental in establishing the Royal Academy, which he later presided over as its first President. Through his work and teachings, Reynolds demonstrated a unique ability to absorb and apply the best qualities of other artists, while also mastering the technical skills necessary to express his own vision.

Section section_02 (Chars 8751–17605):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a successful portrait painter who enjoyed the patronage of high society and raised his prices as his reputation grew. He was a man of many interests and friendships, including with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke, which helped to broaden his intellectual horizons. Despite having some personal flaws, including snobbery and jealousy, Reynolds remained focused on his art and worked hard to produce high-quality portraits, completing up to four per week at the height of his career. He played a key role in the establishment of the Royal Academy, although he took a diplomatic approach and avoided getting involved in the intrigues and controversies surrounding its founding. Ultimately, Reynolds' legacy as one of the greatest British portrait painters remains unchanged by his personal flaws, and his art continues to be celebrated for its interpretive genius and ability to capture the essence of his sitters and their time.

Section section_03 (Chars 17606–26341):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned painter who had achieved great success by 1769, having painted many famous men and women of his time. He was a member of the Dilettanti Society and had a wide circle of friends, including Dr. Johnson, with whom he traveled to Devonshire. Reynolds' studio in Leicester Square was a hub of activity, with a diverse range of sitters, including royalty, politicians, and actors, all seeking to be immortalized by his brush. Despite his success, Reynolds' paintings were not without their flaws, with many of his early works darkening and his later works fading due to his use of experimental pigments. Overall, Reynolds left a glorious heritage to his country, with his portraits characterized by a sane and optimistic note, capturing the best in his sitters.

Section section_04 (Chars 26342–34995):
Section Summary: After being knighted in 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds' social status and reputation continued to grow, and he became more selective with his portrait commissions, painting fewer but still notable works. He was elected mayor of Plympton in 1773 and received an honorary degree from Oxford University, further solidifying his position. Reynolds spent the next several years enjoying life and creating some of his best work, including portraits of notable figures such as General Oglethorpe and Mrs. Siddons. He also traveled to the Low Countries, where he was exposed to the works of other artists, including Franz Hals and Rubens. In 1789, Reynolds' career was abruptly cut short when he lost the use of one eye, forcing him to lay down his brush at the age of 66.

Section section_05 (Chars 34996–43598):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds spent his final years preparing for his death, sustained by memories of the past and surrounded by friends. He delivered his final address to students in 1790 and sat for a portrait by the Swedish artist von Breda, before passing away in 1792 at the age of 68. Reynolds' art is still admired today, and his ability to assimilate and learn from other masters, such as Rembrandt and Titian, contributed to his success. He had a critical eye and a gift for synthesis, which allowed him to create a unique style that combined the excellences of various artists. Reynolds' portraits, while often beautiful and elegant, sometimes lacked a sense of humanity, particularly in his depictions of women and children, which were often idealized and formal.

Section section_06 (Chars 43599–47064):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children lack a sense of intimacy, suggesting he had no deep interest in them. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his exceptional skill and ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' vision was comprehensive, and his portraits were masterful in their simplicity and directness, making it difficult for other artists to approach the same subjects. However, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it challenging to appreciate his work at its best. Despite this, Reynolds' name and fame remain a source of pride in British art and a subject of admiration worldwide.
