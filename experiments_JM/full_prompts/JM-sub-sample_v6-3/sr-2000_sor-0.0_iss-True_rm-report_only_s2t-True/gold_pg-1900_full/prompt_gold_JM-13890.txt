# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury to experience its beauty and historic significance.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–17132):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and sacked by the Danes, but it was later restored and continued to grow and prosper.

Section section_03 (Chars 17133–25886):
Section Summary: After the Norman Conquest, a fire destroyed the Saxon cathedral in Canterbury, and Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, rebuilt it in the Norman style. The new cathedral, completed in 1077, was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, who had returned from exile just a few days prior. The murder was carried out by four knights who had been sent by King Henry II, and it led to Canterbury becoming a major pilgrimage site in Europe. The events surrounding Becket's murder were marked by a tense confrontation between the archbishop and the knights, who ultimately killed him in the cathedral.

Section section_04 (Chars 25887–34521):
Section Summary: Archbishop Thomas Becket's defiant stance against the four knights who came to Canterbury ultimately led to his murder in the cathedral. Despite being aware of the danger, Becket refused to take measures to ensure his safety, and the knights killed him with multiple sword strokes. Following his death, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, with the discovery of his hair-cloth shirt and self-inflicted scourging marks contributing to his canonization. King Henry, who had inadvertently sparked the murder, later performed a severe penance at Canterbury Cathedral, including walking barefoot and receiving strokes with a monastic rod, to atone for his role in Becket's death. This event marked the beginning of Canterbury's reputation as a major pilgrimage site, with thousands of pilgrims flocking to the city to seek relics and miracles associated with St. Thomas.

Section section_05 (Chars 34522–43355):
Section Summary: The city of Canterbury was a major pilgrimage site, with vast crowds of people visiting the Cathedral to see the shrine of Thomas Becket. After a fire damaged the Cathedral in the 12th century, it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman, who incorporated elements of the new Gothic style. The Cathedral was further modified over the centuries, with additions and renovations made in the 13th to 15th centuries, including the construction of a new shrine for Becket's remains. Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the decline of the city, Canterbury remained an important center of the English Church and continued to attract visitors, including royal ones. The city's historic architecture and picturesque streets have been preserved, making it a unique and romantic destination for modern pilgrims and tourists.

Section Summary: The narrator enters the Cathedral precincts through the weather-worn gateway, Prior Goldstone II, and is immediately struck by the vast pile of the Cathedral. As they walk around the building, they take in the various architectural features, including the western towers, the nave, and the Angel Tower. The narrator notes that the monastic buildings, including the great hall and infirmary, are located on the north side of the Cathedral, and points out several notable features, such as the Transitional-Norman treasury and the beautiful Perpendicular cloister. The description then moves to the interior of the Cathedral, beginning at the south porch, which is a beautiful feature with a double row of canopied niches containing statues. The narrator is awestruck by the vast and ordered beauty of the Cathedral's nave, which is a magnificent vestibule to the rest of the building.

Section section_07 (Chars 51604–60071):
Section Summary: The Canterbury Cathedral, a vast and impressive building, remains as a testament to the endeavors of monastic life. The cathedral features various notable architectural elements, including the western screen, the Angel Steeple, and the Trinity Chapel, which was rebuilt by William of Sens and his English successor. The Trinity Chapel is particularly significant, as it was the site of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket, whose fame drew pilgrims from all over Europe. The chapel contains several notable tombs, including those of Henry IV and the Black Prince, as well as a series of 13th-century stained glass windows that depict the cures wrought at the shrine. The cathedral's architecture and historical significance continue to evoke a sense of awe and fascination, much like it did for the pilgrims of the Middle Ages.

Section section_08 (Chars 60072–68780):
Section Summary: The city of Canterbury still retains much of its historic charm, with its old walls and gates, despite some destruction over the centuries. The West Gate is the only remaining gate, and it was nearly demolished in 1850 to accommodate a circus procession, but was saved by the Mayor's casting vote. The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, have undergone various transformations over the years, with some being used for debased purposes before being restored. The Abbey, founded by Augustine, was rescued in 1844 by Mr. Beresford Hope and is now a missionary college, incorporating some of the original structures. Canterbury still has many other treasures to offer, including the Castle, old inns, churches, and museums, showcasing its rich history and architecture.
