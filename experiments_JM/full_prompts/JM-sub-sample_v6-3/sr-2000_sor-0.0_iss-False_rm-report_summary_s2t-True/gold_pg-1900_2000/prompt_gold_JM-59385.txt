You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story is dedicated to the women of America and tells the tale of a Chinese girl named Yen Kuei Ping. The narrative begins on the Street of Precious Pearls, a side street in a Chinese town where girls buy their dowry jewels. Yen Kuei Ping is accompanied by her grandmother, Madame Yen, and other relatives as they visit a jewelry shop. The shop, owned by Wong Lui, is known for its exquisite gems, and the family has come to select pearls for Kuei Ping's dowry.

As they enter the shop, they are greeted by the owner and his attendants, who offer them tea and stools to sit on. Madame Yen and Wong Lui engage in a game of bargaining, each trying to outmaneuver the other. Kuei Ping is fascinated by the pearls and eventually gathers a handful of them in her palm, unaware of the attention she is drawing from the bargainers.

The scene shifts to Kuei Ping's memories of her time at a mission school, where she was sent by her family. She recalls her graduation day, when she stood first in her class and received a small reward. She also remembers her conversation with her principal, Miss Porter, who inspired her with stories of freedom and equality in the United States.

Kuei Ping had been drawn to the idea of freedom and service, but she knew that her family's plans for her marriage and traditional role in society made it impossible for her to pursue. She had decided not to share her feelings with her grandmother or Miss Porter, and instead kept her desires hidden. The memory of her conversation with Miss Porter still brings her pain, as she feels she failed the person she admired most.

As Kuei Ping returns to the present, she hands the pearls back to her grandmother, and the bargain is closed. The family is bowed out of the shop, and they refuse fresh cups of tea, exchanging courtesy phrases with Wong Lui and his attendants. Outside, the chair-bearers wait patiently to take them home. The story highlights the conflict between traditional Chinese values and the desire for freedom and independence that Kuei Ping has developed through her education.
