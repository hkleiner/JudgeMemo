You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author is writing about her experiences in France during World War I. France is divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author wants to visit the war zone, but it's difficult to get permission. She tries to get help from various people, including Americans and members of the French bourgeoisie, but they are unable to assist her.

She eventually meets a duchess who has established hospitals near the front lines and is able to get an introduction to a high-ranking official. The official agrees to help her, but it takes nearly a month to get the necessary permission. The author is finally given a carnet rouge, a special permit that allows her to visit certain areas.

However, the permission is not for the areas she wants to visit, such as Amiens, which is too close to the front lines. Instead, she is allowed to visit Meaux, Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc. The author is disappointed but decides to make the most of her trip. She visits the battlefield of the Marne, where she sees vast fields of graves marked with flags and crosses.

The author is struck by the devastation and the number of deaths. She also visits a village that was under fire for several days and talks to the mayor, who tells her about the experiences of the villagers. The author is eventually allowed to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, where she sees more evidence of the war's impact.

Throughout her journey, the author is impressed by the kindness and courtesy of the French officials she meets. She is also struck by the height and health of the French soldiers she sees on her travels. Despite the difficulties and restrictions, the author is determined to see and experience as much as she can of the war zone. She reflects on the contrast between the comfort and normalcy of Paris and the devastation and destruction of the war zone.

The author's trip is not without its challenges, but she is grateful for the opportunity to see the war's impact firsthand. She is aware of the risks and dangers of the war zone, but she is determined to make the most of her experience. The author's account provides a unique perspective on the experiences of women during World War I and the challenges they faced in accessing the war zone. Overall, the author's journey is a testament to her determination and curiosity about the war and its impact on France and its people.
