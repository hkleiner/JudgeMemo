You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The foreword of the book "Chosen Peoples" is written by Herbert Samuel, who pays tribute to Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar. Davis was born in 1846 and died in 1906, and his life's work was dedicated to the study and interpretation of Hebrew. He wrote several books, including "The Hebrew Accents of the Twenty-one Books of the Bible," and was involved in the creation of a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book.

Davis's work was driven by his passion for Hebrew and his desire to share his knowledge with others. He believed in the importance of preserving and promoting the Hebrew language, which has been revived in Palestine. The book highlights the unique aspect of Hebrew as a language that has outlived its current use and has been preserved for religious purposes alone.

The concept of a "Chosen People" has been a subject of controversy and irritation for non-Jews. The idea is rooted in the Bible, where God promises the Israelites that they will be a chosen people, destined for greatness. However, this concept has been criticized for being egotistical and ferocious.

The book argues that the concept of a Chosen People should be understood in its historical and cultural context. The passages in the Bible that seem to promote violence and superiority should be interpreted in the context of the time and the ethical framework in which they were written.

The author suggests that the idea of a Chosen People is not unique to Judaism and that other nations and religions have similar concepts. The book also highlights the importance of understanding the Bible as a living document that requires interpretation and context.

The author criticizes those who take the Bible literally and ignore its historical and cultural context. The book argues that the concept of a Chosen People should be understood as a call to responsibility and ethics, rather than a claim to superiority.

The foreword concludes by highlighting the importance of Davis's work in promoting Hebrew scholarship and culture. The book is a tribute to his memory and a continuation of his work in promoting a deeper understanding of Jewish thought and learning.

The first chapter of the book explores the concept of a Chosen People in more depth, examining the historical and cultural context in which it emerged. The author argues that the idea of a Chosen People is not a fixed or static concept, but rather a dynamic and evolving idea that has been interpreted and reinterpreted over time.

The chapter also examines the criticisms of the concept of a Chosen People, including the argument that it promotes violence and superiority. The author suggests that these criticisms are based on a misunderstanding of the concept and its historical and cultural context.

The second chapter of the book continues to explore the concept of a Chosen People, examining its implications for Jewish identity and ethics. The author argues that the idea of a Chosen People should be understood as a call to responsibility and ethics, rather than a claim to superiority.

The chapter also examines the relationship between the concept of a Chosen People and other ideas in Jewish thought, such as the concept of messianic prosperity. The author suggests that these ideas should be understood in the context of the ethical framework of Judaism, which emphasizes the importance of justice, compassion, and righteousness.

Overall, the book provides a nuanced and contextualized understanding of the concept of a Chosen People, highlighting its complexities and challenges. The author argues that the idea of a Chosen People should be understood as a dynamic and evolving concept that requires interpretation and context.
