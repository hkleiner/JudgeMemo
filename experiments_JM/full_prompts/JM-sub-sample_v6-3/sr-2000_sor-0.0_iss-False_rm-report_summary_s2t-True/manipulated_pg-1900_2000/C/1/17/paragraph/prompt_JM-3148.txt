You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces a boy named Davy, who is reading from an instruction book about Paganini's violin playing. Davy's uncle, Tony, is a skilled violinist who can create beautiful music. Tony had a difficult time in school, where he was seen as lazy, but he was actually fascinated by the world around him and spent most of his time outdoors, exploring and learning.

As a child, Tony hated school and would often sneak out of the window to play with a tuning fork. He was fascinated by music and would create his own instruments using everyday objects. Despite his struggles in school, Tony's mother recognized that he had a unique way of learning and was acquiring "useless information" about the natural world.

Tony spent most of his free time in the woods, where he would listen to birds and try to imitate their songs. He was curious about the world and would often ask questions about the nature of things. His mother saw him as a bit of a wild child, but she also recognized his intelligence and creativity.

The story also touches on Tony's love of music and his ability to create beautiful sounds on his violin. He is described as having a deep understanding of the instrument and being able to coax beautiful music from it. The author notes that Tony's music is not just about technical skill, but about conveying emotion and telling stories.

As the story progresses, we learn more about Tony's background and his relationship with his mother. We also see glimpses of his daily life, including his interactions with his nephew Davy and his love of nature. The author describes the natural world in vivid detail, from the colors of the sunset to the sounds of the birds in the woods.

Throughout the story, the author emphasizes Tony's unique perspective and his ability to find beauty in the world around him. We see that Tony is not just a musician, but a curious and creative person who is deeply connected to the natural world. The story is a celebration of Tony's individuality and his ability to find joy and meaning in his own way.

The author also notes that Tony's approach to learning is unconventional, but effective. He learns by doing and by exploring the world around him, rather than by following traditional methods. This approach allows him to develop a deep understanding of the natural world and to cultivate his creative talents.

Overall, the story is a poignant and evocative portrayal of a unique individual and his place in the world. It celebrates the beauty of nature, the power of music, and the importance of individuality and creativity. The author's use of language is vivid and descriptive, making it easy to imagine the world of the story and to become immersed in Tony's life.
