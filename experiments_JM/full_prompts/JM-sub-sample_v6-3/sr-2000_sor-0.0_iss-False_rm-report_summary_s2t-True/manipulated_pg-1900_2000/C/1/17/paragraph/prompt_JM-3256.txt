You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The concept of a bookman is explored, distinguishing between someone who owns many books and someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature. A bookman is not made, but born, with a natural passion for reading and learning. The author recounts a personal experience with a wealthy book owner who showcased his expensive bookcase, but lacked the true spirit of a bookman. 

In contrast, a story is told about a Colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary knowledge, instinctively sought out the works of great authors like Shakespeare and Milton. This example highlights that a true bookman is not defined by their education or social status, but by their genuine love for literature. 

The author also discusses the lives of notable figures like Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds, who were influenced by their associations with other intellectuals and artists. Despite their flaws and weaknesses, these individuals were able to cultivate their minds and contribute to the world of thought. 

The concept of a classic book is also explored, with the author citing the French critic Sainte-Beuve's definition of a classic as a work that enriches the human mind and speaks to all people in a unique yet timeless style. Such books are likened to great cathedrals that stand the test of time, providing inspiration and wisdom to generations. 

In addition, the author touches on the historical context of the French Revolution and its impact on societal change. The Revolution caused a panic that delayed democratic reforms, but ultimately paved the way for progress. 

The true bookman is characterized by their humility, receptivity, and passion for learning, rather than their wealth or social status. They are able to appreciate the beauty and value of great literature, and are inspired by the works of classic authors. 

Ultimately, the author suggests that being a bookman is not just about owning books, but about cultivating a deep love and appreciation for literature and the world of ideas. This love can be found in people from all walks of life, regardless of their background or education. 

The author's anecdotes and examples illustrate the importance of distinguishing between true bookmen and those who merely collect books for show. By exploring the lives and characteristics of notable bookmen, the author highlights the value of a genuine love for literature and the impact it can have on individuals and society. 

The concept of a classic book is also explored in depth, with the author emphasizing its timelessness and ability to inspire future generations. The author's use of metaphors, such as comparing classic books to cathedrals, adds depth and complexity to the discussion. 

Overall, the author's exploration of the bookman and classic literature provides a nuanced and thought-provoking discussion of the importance of literature and learning in our lives. By examining the characteristics of true bookmen and the value of classic literature, the author encourages readers to cultivate their own love of learning and appreciation for the world of ideas. 

The author's writing style is engaging and accessible, making the topic of bookmen and classic literature approachable and interesting to a wide range of readers. The use of anecdotes and examples adds a personal touch to the discussion, while the exploration of historical context provides a broader understanding of the subject. 

In conclusion, the author's discussion of bookmen and classic literature highlights the importance of cultivating a deep love and appreciation for literature and the world of ideas. By distinguishing between true bookmen and those who merely collect books for show, the author encourages readers to develop their own passion for learning and to appreciate the value of classic literature.
