You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author of the book participated in a historic movement, which is the subject of the book. The movement is related to the establishment of a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands by the United States Government. On a specific day, 499 trained men and women were sent from San Francisco to the Philippines to achieve this goal. The author describes the journey, including the departure from San Francisco and the stop at Honolulu, where they visited the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology.

The author notes that the Industrial Revolution and the French monarchy had been in decline before the accession of George III and Louis XV, respectively. The day the teachers departed marked an epoch in history, as it was the first time a conquering people sent a group of educators to bring benefits to the conquered, rather than soldiers to subjugate them.

The ship, the United States Army Transport "Thomas," sailed from San Francisco and passed through the Golden Gate, carrying the largest number of teachers and pedagogical equipment to a foreign land. The author describes the scenery and the people they encountered during their journey, including the whales they saw and the stop at Honolulu.

At Honolulu, they visited the Pali, a gigantic precipice, and the Bishop Museum, which contains a collection of Polynesian artifacts. The author also describes the sport of surf-shooting, which is popular among the native people. The ship then continued its journey, crossing the International Date Line, where the crew held the "Revels of Neptune" celebration.

The author mentions the Bahá'í Faith and its relatively obscure development during the earlier decades of the century. They also note that Arnold Toynbee was intrigued by the phenomenon of the emergence of a new universal religion. The ship eventually reached Manila, where the teachers disembarked and were introduced to the local people.

The author describes the city of Manila, which was built by the Spaniards and modeled after medieval towns in Europe. The city has a rich history, with a mix of cultures and people from different parts of the world. The author stood on the old stone bridge, watching the people and vehicles passing by, and noted the cosmopolitan mixture of the population.

The teachers remained in Manila for about two weeks, awaiting assignment to their stations. During this time, they were instructed to supply themselves with certain articles, which caused consternation among them. The author's journey and experiences are the subject of the book, which aims to provide an account of the historic movement and the people involved. The book is intended to be of interest to those who are sympathetic to great movements and enjoy stories of personal experiences in distant lands.
