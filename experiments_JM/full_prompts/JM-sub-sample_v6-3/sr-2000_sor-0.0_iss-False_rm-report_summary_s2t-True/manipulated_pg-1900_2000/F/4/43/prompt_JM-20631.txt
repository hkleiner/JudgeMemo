You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of the Jewish people being chosen by God. The foreword, written by Herbert Samuel, introduces the series of lectures in memory of Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar. Davis was born in 1846 and died in 1906, and his work focused on promoting Hebraic thought and learning. He was a prolific writer and translator, and his contributions to the field of Hebrew studies are still valued today.

The foreword also discusses the revival of languages, including Hebrew, which has been preserved as a ritual language but is now becoming a living language again in Palestine. Samuel notes that Hebrew is unique in that it has shown signs of renewing its old vitality, unlike other ritual languages that have become extinct.

The first chapter of the book explores the concept of the "Chosen People" and how it has been perceived by non-Jews throughout history. The author notes that this concept has been a source of irritation for Gentiles, who have often seen it as a claim of superiority. The chapter also discusses how the idea of a chosen people has been used by other groups, including the Germans, who have evolved a doctrine of special election.

The author argues that the concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism and that other cultures have similar beliefs. The chapter also examines the biblical passages that are often cited as evidence of Jewish superiority, including the treatment of the Amalekites and other Palestine tribes. However, the author notes that these passages must be understood in their historical context and that they are often torn from their context.

The second chapter continues to explore the concept of the chosen people, arguing that it is not a claim of superiority but rather a call to responsibility. The author notes that the biblical passages that seem to promote violence and egotism must be understood in their ethical framework, which emphasizes righteousness and justice. The chapter also discusses how the concept of a chosen people has been misunderstood and misused throughout history, and how it is still relevant today.

The author argues that the Bible must be interpreted in its historical context and that it is absurd to judge it by modern standards. The chapter concludes by noting that the concept of a chosen people is complex and multifaceted, and that it requires a nuanced understanding of the biblical text and its historical context. Overall, the book "Chosen Peoples" provides a thought-provoking exploration of the concept of the chosen people and its significance in Jewish tradition and beyond. 

The idea of a chosen people is not limited to Judaism, and other cultures have similar beliefs. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the biblical passages in their historical context. The book aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the concept of the chosen people, exploring its complexities and significance in Jewish tradition and beyond. 

The author's goal is to promote a deeper understanding of the Jewish faith and its traditions, and to challenge common misconceptions about the concept of the chosen people. By examining the biblical passages and their historical context, the author provides a fresh perspective on this complex and multifaceted concept. 

In conclusion, the book "Chosen Peoples" offers a thought-provoking exploration of the concept of the chosen people, challenging common misconceptions and promoting a deeper understanding of the Jewish faith and its traditions. The author's nuanced understanding of the biblical passages and their historical context provides a fresh perspective on this complex concept.
