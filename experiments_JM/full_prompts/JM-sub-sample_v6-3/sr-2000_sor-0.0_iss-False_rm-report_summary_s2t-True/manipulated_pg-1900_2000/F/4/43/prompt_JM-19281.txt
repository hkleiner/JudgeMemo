You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Bahá'í community addressed an open letter to the world's religious leaders in 2002, highlighting the need for organized religion to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of God and religion. The letter emphasized the importance of this principle in ensuring the continuing relevance of the great revealed faiths. The response to the letter was encouraging, with many recipients expressing distress over the failure of religious institutions to address spiritual and moral challenges.

The Bahá'í community feels hopeful that their initiative may serve as a catalyst for new understanding and change. However, they recognize that the task of ensuring that their message is engaged by people everywhere is their own responsibility. To respond to this need, Bahá'ís must draw on a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves.

The writings of Bahá'u'lláh provide insights that can help elevate discussion of religious issues above sectarian considerations. The Bahá'í community has commissioned a commentary, "One Common Faith," which reviews relevant passages from Bahá'u'lláh's writings and the scriptures of other faiths against the background of the contemporary crisis.

The period of history now opening is expected to be more receptive to efforts to spread Bahá'u'lláh's message. A sea change in human consciousness is underway, driven by a growing recognition of the limitations of materialistic interpretations of reality. The twentieth century saw the consolidation of a materialistic worldview, which led to the marginalization of spiritual forces and the erosion of moral values.

However, as the century drew to a close, a groundswell of anxiety and discontent emerged, driven by a sense of spiritual emptiness. Ancient sectarian conflicts re-emerged, and scriptural themes and theological dogmas regained significance. The world is now warned of a war of civilizations defined by irreconcilable religious antipathies.

Despite this, there is a widespread revival of spiritual search, with people seeking a personal identity that transcends the physical. This development encourages a multitude of pursuits, both positive and negative. The Bahá'í community sees this as an opportunity to promote a more profound understanding of religion and its role in society.

The reawakened interest in religion is far from reaching its peak, and the phenomenon is gathering momentum. The most obvious cause of this re-evaluation is the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise, which has led to the collapse of totalitarian regimes and the recognition of the limitations of economic development as a guide to social improvement.

Other systems of social experimentation have also been found wanting, and the world is now faced with a mounting burden of evidence of social pathologies. The fate of social and economic development has left no doubt about the need for a new approach. The Bahá'í community believes that their message offers a way forward, and they are committed to promoting a deeper understanding of the oneness of God and religion. 

The world is at a critical juncture, and the choice is between a continued descent into chaos and a new era of peace and prosperity. The Bahá'í community is hopeful that their initiative will contribute to a new understanding of religion's purpose and its role in promoting a more just and peaceful world. 

Ultimately, the goal is to create a world where people can live in harmony, united in their diversity, and inspired by a common sense of purpose. The Bahá'í community believes that this goal is achievable, and they are committed to working towards it. 

The challenge is significant, but the potential reward is great. The world can be a better place, and the Bahá'í community is dedicated to making it so. 

In conclusion, the Bahá'í community's initiative is a call to action, a reminder that the time has come for a new era of cooperation and understanding. The world is ready for a change, and the Bahá'í community is ready to play its part. 

The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the need for a new approach to religion and its role in society has never been more pressing. The Bahá'í community is committed to promoting a deeper understanding of the oneness of God and religion, and they are hopeful that their initiative will contribute to a brighter future for all. 

The time for change is now, and the Bahá'í community is ready to work towards a more just and peaceful world. The world can be a better place, and the Bahá'í community is dedicated to making it so. 

In the end, the choice is clear: a continued descent into chaos or a new era of peace and prosperity. The Bahá'í community chooses the latter, and they invite others to join them on this journey towards a brighter future. 

The journey will not be easy, but the potential reward is great. The world can be a better place, and the Bahá'í community is committed to making it so. 

The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the need for a new approach to religion and its role in society has never been more pressing. The Bahá'í
