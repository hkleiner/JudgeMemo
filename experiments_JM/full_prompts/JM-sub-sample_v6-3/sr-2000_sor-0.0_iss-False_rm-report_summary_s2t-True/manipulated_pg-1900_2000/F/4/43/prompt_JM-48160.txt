You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author is writing about her experiences in France during World War I. France is divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author wants to visit the war zone, but it's difficult to get permission. She tries to meet with members of the middle or lower bourgeoisie, but they are reserved and suspicious of foreigners.

The author applies to visit the front lines, but it's not easy. She meets with a duchess who has established hospitals near the front and is on good terms with the Military Hospital Service Board. The duchess introduces the author to a secretary who agrees to help her get permission to visit the base hospitals. However, the process takes a long time, and the author has to wait nearly a month.

Finally, the author receives a note from the Ministry of War asking for photographs and a signed paper. She is then summoned to the office of the Service de Santé, where she meets with two charming gentlemen who tell her she can visit Rouen and Meaux. However, the author wants to go to Amiens, which is closer to the front lines.

The author is told that it's impossible to go to Amiens because of the battle of the Somme. She is offered alternative destinations, including Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc. The author agrees to visit these places and is given a carnet rouge, a precious little red book with blank permits.

The author visits Meaux with a French friend and sees the impressive sight of the battlefield of the Marne. She is struck by the vast fields of waving grain broken by drooping and faded flags marking the graves of the fallen. The author also visits cemeteries and sees the ruins of a church and houses.

A few days later, the author is summoned again to the Ministry of War and is told that she can visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc. She is also given a letter asking the military authorities to show her every civility. The author is happy with the arrangements and is determined to make the most of her trip.

As she travels to Châlons, the author reflects on her experiences and is struck by the crowds of soldiers at the train station. She observes the soldiers' height and health, and wonders if the whole front is on vacation. The author is accompanied by officers on the train and has time to observe them at leisure. She is impressed by their height and demeanor, and is grateful for the opportunity to see the war zone firsthand.
