You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" begins with a foreword by Herbert Samuel, who pays tribute to Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar. Davis was born in 1846 and died in 1906, and his life's work was dedicated to the study and interpretation of Hebrew. He was a prolific writer and translator, and his work on the Hebrew language helped to revive its use. 

Davis's contributions to Hebrew scholarship were significant, and he was able to put his knowledge to good use. He wrote a volume on the Hebrew accents of the Bible and planned a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book. His work was characterized by a deep love for the Hebrew language and a desire to share his knowledge with others.

The foreword also touches on the theme of language preservation and revival. Samuel notes that many languages, including Hebrew, have been preserved for ritual purposes, even if they are no longer spoken in everyday life. However, Hebrew is unique in that it is experiencing a revival, particularly in Palestine.

The first chapter of the book explores the concept of the "Chosen People" and how it has been perceived by non-Jews throughout history. The author notes that this idea has often been met with irritation and hostility, with some critics arguing that it implies Jewish superiority over other nations.

The author also examines how the idea of a "Chosen People" has been used by other groups, including the Germans, who have developed their own doctrine of special election. The author argues that this idea is not unique to Judaism and that other cultures have similar concepts.

The second chapter delves deeper into the concept of the "Chosen People" and how it is presented in the Bible. The author acknowledges that some passages in the Bible may seem ferocious or egotistical, but argues that they must be understood in their historical context. The author also notes that the idea of a "Chosen People" is not necessarily about superiority, but rather about a special relationship between the Jewish people and God.

Overall, the book "Chosen Peoples" explores the complex and often misunderstood concept of the "Chosen People" and its significance in Jewish culture and history. The author argues that this idea should be understood in its historical and cultural context, rather than being judged by modern standards or used to imply superiority over other nations.
