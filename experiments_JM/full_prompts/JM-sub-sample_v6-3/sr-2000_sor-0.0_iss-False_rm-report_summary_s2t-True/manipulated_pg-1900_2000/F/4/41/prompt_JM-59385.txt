You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story is dedicated to the women of America and tells the tale of a Chinese girl named Yen Kuei Ping. The narrative begins on the Street of Precious Pearls, a significant location in Chinese towns where girls buy their dowry jewels. Yen Kuei Ping, accompanied by her grandmother, mother, and a relative, visits the street to purchase pearls for her dowry. The family arrives at a shop with rich filigree carvings, where they are greeted by the owner, Wong Lui, and his attendants.

As they enter the shop, Kuei Ping is fascinated by the jewels on display. Her grandmother, Madame Yen, is a skilled bargainer, and she carefully selects the most exquisite pearls. Kuei Ping is drawn to the pearls' warm, luminous color and can't help but touch them. The shop owner and his clerks bring out more treasures, and the bargaining process begins.

Madame Yen and Wong Lui engage in a game of chess-like negotiations, each trying to outmaneuver the other. Kuei Ping is captivated by the pearls and holds them in her hand, feeling their beauty and life. The bargaining continues, with cups of tea being served at intervals to ease the tension.

As Kuei Ping sits with the pearls, she is suddenly transported back to her memories of the little mission school she attended. She recalls her graduation day, when she stood first in her class and received a small reward. She also remembers her conversation with Miss Porter, the American principal, who inspired her with stories of freedom and equal opportunity in the United States.

Kuei Ping had always admired Miss Porter and felt a deep connection to her. However, she knew that her family had already planned her marriage, and she couldn't pursue her dreams of freedom and service. The conflict between her desire for independence and her family's expectations is a hard one for Kuei Ping to resolve.

As the bargaining comes to a close, Madame Yen reaches for the pearls, and the family prepares to leave. The shop owner and his attendants bid them farewell, and the chair-bearers wait patiently outside. The story ends with Kuei Ping lost in thought, her heart torn between her love for her family and her desire for freedom and self-discovery.

The narrative highlights the cultural differences between East and West, as well as the limitations placed on women in traditional Chinese society. Kuei Ping's story is a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by women in patriarchal cultures, where family expectations and social norms can constrain their choices and aspirations. The Street of Precious Pearls serves as a symbol of the confined world that Kuei Ping inhabits, where her choices are limited, and her future is predetermined.

The story also explores the theme of cultural exchange and understanding. Kuei Ping's encounter with Miss Porter and the American mission school has broadened her horizons, introducing her to new ideas and values. However, the cultural divide between East and West proves to be a significant obstacle, making it difficult for Kuei Ping to reconcile her desires with the expectations of her family and society.

Ultimately, the narrative presents a nuanced portrayal of a young woman's struggle to navigate the complexities of her cultural heritage and her own aspirations. Kuei Ping's story is a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy, understanding, and self-discovery in bridging the gaps between different cultures and societies.
