You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces a young boy named Davy, who is reading to his uncle, Anthony Croft. Anthony is blind and asks Davy to read to him from an old instruction book. The story being read is about Paganini, a famous violinist, who improvises a musical interpretation of a tragic story, causing several ladies to faint.

Davy is fascinated by the story, but skeptical about its truth. Anthony, however, believes it and says that he can hear the music in his mind. He tells Davy that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin. Anthony asks Davy to paint a picture with words, describing the landscape outside.

Davy describes the scene in vivid detail, including the setting sun, the bridge, and the trees. Anthony smiles and asks if Davy has fed the chickens. Davy realizes he has forgotten and rushes to feed them. Anthony then takes out his violin and begins to play. The music is beautiful and fills the atmosphere with harmony.

The story then flashes back to Anthony's childhood. He was a curious and restless boy who hated school. He longed for knowledge, but the school couldn't provide him with the answers he sought. Instead, he found solace in the woods, where he could explore and learn about nature. Anthony's teachers saw him as lazy, but he was actually just bored with the traditional schooling.

As a child, Anthony was fascinated by music and sound. He would often sneak out of the classroom to play with a tuning fork he had hidden outside. He would also create makeshift instruments using everyday objects. Despite his struggles in school, Anthony's mother recognized that he had a unique way of learning and that he had a deep understanding of the natural world.

Anthony's love for music and nature only grew stronger as he got older. He would spend hours in the woods, listening to birds and trying to imitate their songs. He developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of the world around him and found joy in discovering new things. The story suggests that Anthony's unconventional approach to learning ultimately led him to become a skilled musician and a wise and thoughtful person.
