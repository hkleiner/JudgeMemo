You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their own journey into the teaching profession, which began as a temporary solution after college. Many of their peers viewed teaching as a "fill-in job" rather than a respectable career. The author shares the story of two young men who entered the teaching profession under similar circumstances. One man, who became a school superintendent, was unprepared and uninterested in his job, while the other man was enthusiastic and dedicated to making a positive impact on his students.

The author visits a school where the first man is working and notices the poor condition of the facilities, including the seating arrangements in the classrooms. In contrast, the second man has taken initiative to improve the school environment and create a positive learning space. The author is impressed by the second man's dedication and enthusiasm, which ultimately leads to his success as an educator.

The author then discusses the importance of finding the right fit in the teaching profession. Many young people enter the field without considering their strengths and weaknesses, leading to a high failure rate.

A pleasing and forceful personality can make a significant difference in a teacher's ability to connect with students.

Teachers should continually seek to broaden their knowledge and skills to remain effective in the classroom. When applying for positions, teachers should be careful to provide accurate and complete information, and should choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications.

The author shares examples of candidates who have applied for positions, including one who was overly concerned with the salary and another who was eager to continue her education and specialization. The author encourages teachers to prioritize their professional development and to seek out opportunities for growth and improvement. By doing so, they can make a positive impact on their students and achieve success in their careers. Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of dedication, hard work, and a commitment to excellence in the teaching profession.
