You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and hyper-space pilot, is on the planet Irwadi, where he works for the Interstellar Transfer Service. He is summoned by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, who informs him that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Transfer Service, effectively taking control of all hyper-space ships on the planet. Ramsey is shocked and skeptical, as he knows that navigating hyper-space is a complex task that few Irwadians have mastered.

Chind Ramar explains that all outworld pilots, including Ramsey, are no longer allowed to fly and must surrender their permits. Ramsey is forced to hand over his license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. The Irwadian government has made it clear that they will not provide any assistance to outworlders.

Ramsey meets with his friend Stu Englander, a fellow pilot who is struggling to make ends meet. Englander is broke and has a family to support, so Ramsey lends him some money to help him get by. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is left with only a few credits.

At the gambling hall, Ramsey encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who is looking for trouble. The Irwadian accuses Ramsey of being a troublemaker and tells him to leave, but Ramsey stands his ground. The situation is tense, but Ramsey is not looking for a fight.

As the night wears on, Ramsey reflects on his situation and the challenges he faces as an outworlder on Irwadi. He knows that he will have to be careful and resourceful if he is to survive until he can find a way off the planet. Meanwhile, Chind Ramar is enjoying the power and control that the planetarization of the Transfer Service has given him, and he is determined to make the most of it.

The planetarization of the Transfer Service is a significant event that will have far-reaching consequences for the outworlders on Irwadi. It is clear that the Irwadian government is determined to assert its control and dominance over the planet, and that outworlders will be forced to adapt to the new reality. Ramsey and his fellow pilots will have to find a way to navigate this new landscape and survive until they can find a way off the planet.

The situation on Irwadi is complex and tense, with the Irwadian government and the outworlders having very different interests and agendas. The planetarization of the Transfer Service has created a power vacuum, and it is unclear how things will play out in the coming days and weeks. One thing is certain, however: the outworlders on Irwadi will have to be resourceful and determined if they are to survive and thrive in this challenging environment.

Ramsey's encounter with the drunk Irwadian at the gambling hall is a reminder of the tensions and conflicts that can arise between outworlders and Irwadians. The Irwadian's accusations and hostility towards Ramsey are a reflection of the deeper tensions and prejudices that exist between the two groups. As the situation on Irwadi continues to evolve, it is likely that these tensions will come to the forefront, leading to further conflict and challenges for the outworlders.

In the midst of this uncertainty and tension, Ramsey remains determined and resourceful. He is a skilled pilot and a seasoned outworlder, and he is confident that he can find a way to survive and thrive on Irwadi. However, he is also aware of the challenges and dangers that lie ahead, and he knows that he will have to be careful and strategic if he is to succeed.
