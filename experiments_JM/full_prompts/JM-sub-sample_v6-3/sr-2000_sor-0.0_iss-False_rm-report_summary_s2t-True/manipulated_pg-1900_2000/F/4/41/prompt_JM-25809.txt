You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins in Sweet Briar Gulch, a beautiful valley surrounded by wild flowers, trees, and vines. Jim Felton, a prospector, sits on the doorstep of his cabin, feeling unhappy and frustrated. He has been searching for gold in the gulch but has not found any, despite his calculations and efforts. Jim has sunk about 50 prospect holes, but all he has found is ashy wash beneath the surface.

As he sits, Jim reads a letter from his sweetheart, Anne, who has rejected his proposal of marriage due to his lack of financial stability. Anne explains that she wants a modest assurance of being able to live on, and Jim's way of life as a prospector does not provide that. Jim is hurt and enraged by the letter, feeling that Anne is being mercenary.

Despite his feelings, Jim knows that Anne is not being selfish, and he understands her concerns. He looks at her photograph and imagines how happy they could be together in the gulch, even without finding gold. However, his frustration and anger get the better of him, and he destroys his pipe in a fit of rage.

Just then, Bud, the mail carrier, arrives on his horse, interrupting Jim's misery. Bud is a cheerful and friendly giant who tries to lift Jim's spirits. He offers Jim two dollars and suggests that he go to town, get drunk, and forget his troubles. Jim declines, feeling that he cannot pay Bud back, but Bud insists that he take the money and have a good time.

Bud also offers Jim his horse to ride to Plattsburg, the nearest station, which is 50 miles away. Jim declines, feeling that it is too far to walk, but Bud suggests that he round up one of the burros that are grazing in the area. Bud goes to fetch a burro, and when he returns, he tells Jim about his encounter with a would-be thief who tried to steal the mail. The thief, a humpbacked man, was unsuccessful and was given $10 by Bud, who warned him not to bother him again.

As Bud prepares to leave, Jim thanks him for his kindness, but Bud brushes it off, saying that's what friends are for. Jim and Bud part ways, and Jim is left to contemplate his situation and his feelings about Anne's letter. Despite his frustration and disappointment, Jim is grateful for Bud's friendship and support. The story ends with Jim sitting on the mail sack, waiting for Bud to return with the burro, feeling a sense of camaraderie and appreciation for his friend's kindness.
