You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, suggesting that its magic has been lost for many adults. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a chore. The author argues that this is because the spirit of faith and goodwill that once characterized Christmas has been weakened by the influence of science and skepticism.

The author suggests that the decline of Christmas is not just a personal issue, but a societal one. Many people have lost faith in the idea of goodwill and mutual support, and instead focus on more mundane concerns like material possessions and social status. However, the author argues that goodwill is still essential for human happiness and that it can be cultivated through practice and effort.

The author proposes that one way to revitalize Christmas is to focus on the idea of goodwill and mutual support. This can be done by cultivating a sense of sympathy and understanding for others, and by making an effort to connect with them on a deeper level. The author suggests that this can be achieved through simple acts like writing a heartfelt letter or giving a thoughtful gift.

The author also reflects on the idea of the "Feast of St. Friend," which is a celebration of the importance of human relationships and connections. The author argues that this is what Christmas should be about, rather than just a time for material indulgence. By focusing on the values of goodwill, sympathy, and mutual support, we can create a more meaningful and fulfilling Christmas experience.

In addition, the author discusses the idea of New Year's resolutions and how they often fail to bring about lasting change. The author suggests that this is because people often focus on external goals rather than internal transformation. Instead, the author proposes that people should focus on cultivating a sense of goodwill and sympathy for others, and that this will lead to greater happiness and fulfillment.

Ultimately, the author argues that the key to a happy and fulfilling life is not to achieve some kind of perfection or external goal, but to cultivate a sense of inner peace and contentment. This can be achieved by accepting the imperfections and challenges of life, and by focusing on the present moment rather than some future ideal. By doing so, we can create a more meaningful and fulfilling Christmas experience, and a more happy and fulfilling life. 

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of human connections and relationships in bringing joy and fulfillment to our lives. The author suggests that by prioritizing these relationships and cultivating a sense of goodwill and sympathy, we can create a more positive and supportive community. The author also notes that this is not a one-time achievement, but rather an ongoing process that requires effort and practice. 

Overall, the author's message is one of hope and optimism, encouraging readers to focus on the values of goodwill, sympathy, and mutual support, and to cultivate a sense of inner peace and contentment. By doing so, we can create a more meaningful and fulfilling Christmas experience, and a more happy and fulfilling life. 

The book ends with a sense of reflection and contemplation, inviting readers to think about their own values and priorities, and to consider how they can cultivate a sense of goodwill and sympathy in their own lives. The author's final thoughts are a call to action, encouraging readers to make a positive impact on the world around them, and to create a more compassionate and supportive community. 

In the end, the author's vision for a more fulfilling and meaningful Christmas experience is one that is rooted in the values of goodwill, sympathy, and mutual support. By prioritizing these values, we can create a more positive and supportive community, and bring greater joy and fulfillment to our lives. 

The author's ideas are thought-provoking and inspiring, encouraging readers to think differently about the holiday season and their place in the world. The book is a call to action, inviting readers to make a positive impact on the world around them, and to cultivate a sense of goodwill and sympathy in their own lives. 

The final message of the book is one of hope and optimism, suggesting that by working together and prioritizing the values of goodwill and mutual support, we can create a more compassionate and supportive community. The author's vision is one of a more fulfilling and meaningful Christmas experience, one that is rooted in the values of sympathy, kindness, and generosity. 

The book concludes by emphasizing the importance of human connections and relationships in bringing joy and fulfillment to our lives.

The author's final thoughts are a call to action, encouraging readers to make a positive impact on the world around them, and to create a more compassionate and supportive community. 

Overall, the book is a thought-provoking and inspiring exploration of the holiday season and our place in the world.
