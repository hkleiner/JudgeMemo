You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals attempting to capture Richmond, none had succeeded. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan came closest in 1862, but was repulsed on the outskirts of the city. The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the Union failing to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia.

In the West, the Union had more success, capturing Vicksburg and Chattanooga, and throwing open the gateway to Georgia. The beginning of 1864 found the Northern armies in a stronger position, with greater resources and a possibility of splitting the Southern states. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given responsibility for all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction, leaving execution to Maj. Gen. George G. Meade.

The Union plan called for a two-pronged attack, with Grant targeting Richmond and Petersburg, and Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman targeting Atlanta and the Army of Tennessee. The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast. On June 15, 1864, the XVIII Corps launched a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line, capturing a significant portion of it. However, the Confederates were able to regroup and hold their position.

The Battle of Petersburg began on June 15, with the Union army attempting to capture the city. Despite initial successes, the Confederates were able to hold their ground, and the Union army suffered heavy casualties. The battle continued for several days, with the Union army attempting to break through the Confederate lines. On June 18, the Confederates withdrew to a new line, and the Union army was unable to break through.

The Union army then began to dig in and prepare for a siege, with Grant ordering the construction of fortifications and the development of siege tactics. The Confederates, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, were able to hold their position, but the Union army continued to apply pressure. In July 1864, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate lines, including the Battle of the Crater, which was a failed attempt to break through the lines using a mine.

The Union army continued to apply pressure, with Grant ordering a series of attacks on the Confederate lines. In August 1864, the Union army captured the Weldon Railroad, a crucial supply line for the Confederates. The Confederates launched a series of counterattacks, but were unable to retake the railroad. The Union army continued to push the Confederates back, capturing more territory and applying pressure on the city of Petersburg.

In March 1865, Lee launched a desperate attack on the Union lines, known as the Battle of Fort Stedman. The attack was repulsed, and the Union army continued to push the Confederates back. On April 1, 1865, the Union army launched a series of attacks on the Confederate lines, including the Battle of Five Forks. The Confederates were defeated, and Lee was forced to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond.

On April 2, 1865, the Union army launched a final attack on the Confederate lines, breaking through and capturing the city of Petersburg. The Confederates retreated, and the Union army pursued them. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked a significant turning point in the war, and the Union army's victory ultimately led to the defeat of the Confederacy.
