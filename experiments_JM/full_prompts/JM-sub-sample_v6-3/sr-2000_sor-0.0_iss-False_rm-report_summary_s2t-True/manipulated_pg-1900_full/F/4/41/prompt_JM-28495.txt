You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, trying to find the Home for Lost Dogs in Battersea to adopt a dog. They follow a man who works at the home, but their attempt at stealth fails, and they end up lost. The next day, they find a puppy in a pond, and Stella decides to keep it. They name the puppy Excalibur, or Scally for short.

As Scally grows up, he becomes a beloved member of the family. He is a large, clumsy dog with a gentle nature. The narrator's sister-in-law, Eileen, takes care of Scally and teaches him a few tricks. Scally becomes a regular companion to Eileen and the narrator's wife, Stella.

One day, Eileen meets a curate named Gerald Gilmore, and they fall in love. However, Gerald is poor and cannot afford to marry Eileen. They decide to keep their relationship a secret and wait until Gerald's financial situation improves. Eileen and Gerald exchange letters, and Scally becomes a symbol of their love.

Years pass, and Gerald is transferred to a new parish. Eileen and Scally stay behind, but they eventually reunite with Gerald in the north. On their way to meet Gerald, they are involved in a train accident. Scally helps rescue people from the wreckage, and Gerald is injured while saving two children.

The accident brings Gerald and Eileen back together, and they finally get married. Lord Caversham, a director of the railway company, is grateful to Gerald for his heroism and offers to help him find a better-paying job. Gerald and Eileen settle down in a new parish, and Scally remains their loyal companion.

The story ends with Eileen, now married to Gerald and living in a rectory, using Scally to chase away a tramp who is begging for money. Scally is still a gentle giant, but he is fiercely protective of his family. The narrator reflects on the role that Scally has played in bringing Gerald and Eileen together and notes that the dog has brought joy and companionship to their lives.
