You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their journey to becoming a schoolmaster, starting with their college days when they didn't consider teaching as a career. However, after graduation, they found themselves unprepared for a definite position and decided to become a teacher to save their pride. The author notes that many young men and women enter the educational field without considering the type of work they are best fitted to do, leading to a large percentage of teacher failures.

To succeed as a teacher, one needs a pleasing yet forceful personality, good preparation, and experience. The author emphasizes the importance of making a good personal impression, being desirous of making a difference, and being open to learning and growth. They also stress the need for self-examination and study to realize one's strengths and limitations.

The author shares their experience of attending county, sectional, state, and national teachers' meetings to become acquainted with current school problems and educational leaders. They decided to secure the superintendency of schools in a small town, which they believed was the proper educational step for them.

As a superintendent, the author found it profitable to hold sectional meetings for teachers to discuss specific topics and improve the course of study and methods of work. They also believe in the importance of personal talks with teachers to learn about their work and difficulties. The author notes that school boards have not always purchased everything they requested, but having faith in the superintendent and feeling that they know what they want can make a significant difference.

The author discusses the role of the janitor in the school, emphasizing the importance of treating them well and making them feel like part of the team. They share an experience where they worked with a janitor to clean and organize the school building, which led to a positive change in the janitor's attitude and cooperation.

The author also explores the relationship between the principal and the teacher, highlighting the need for the principal to provide professional leadership, administrative support, and personal relationships. They discuss the importance of assisting teachers with exceptional children, interpreting the course of study, and providing definite directions and supplies.

Furthermore, the author touches on the topic of school activities, noting that they can be beneficial but also require proper direction and management. They quote a report from a Seattle high school principal, which emphasizes the importance of extra-curricular activities in developing school pride, socializing the institution, and discovering latent talents.

Finally, the author discusses the relationship between the school and the community, emphasizing the need for the school to adjust to the changing needs of the community and provide vocational guidance to students. They share examples of how schools can provide special courses of study and club organizations to help students learn about different vocations and make informed decisions about their future. The author concludes that the schoolmaster of tomorrow must realize that there is much good in the education of the past, but also be willing to make readjustments to meet the changing conditions in social and industrial life.
