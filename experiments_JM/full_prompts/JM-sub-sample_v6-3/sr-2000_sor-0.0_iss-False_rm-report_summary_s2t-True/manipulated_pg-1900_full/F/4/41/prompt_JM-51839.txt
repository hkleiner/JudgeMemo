You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Nacogdoches, Texas, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. The city was founded by Antonio Gil Ybarbo in 1779 and was a major hub for trade and commerce. The area was originally inhabited by the Tejas Indians, who had a complex society with their own government and traditions. In 1716, the Spanish established the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, which marked the beginning of European settlement in the area.

The city played a significant role in the Texas Revolution, with many prominent figures, including Sam Houston and Thomas J. Rusk, living and operating in the area. The Old Stone Fort, built by Ybarbo in 1779, served as a trading post, a military outpost, and even a capitol building during the revolution. The fort was also the site of the Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832, which marked a turning point in the revolution.

Nacogdoches was a major center for education and culture, with the establishment of the Nacogdoches University in 1845. The city was also home to many prominent figures, including Adolphus Sterne, who was a leader in the Masonic community and a prominent businessman. The city's history is also marked by its role in the Mexican Revolution and the Civil War.

Today, Nacogdoches is a thriving city with a strong sense of history and community. The city is home to Stephen F. Austin State University, which was established in 1917 and is named after the famous empresario. The university is located on the site of the old Nacogdoches University and features several historic buildings, including the Thomas J. Rusk building.

The city has many historic sites, including the Old Stone Fort, which has been reconstructed and now serves as a museum. The city is also home to the Oak Grove Cemetery, which is the final resting place of many prominent figures from the city's history. The cemetery features several historic markers and monuments, including the grave of Thomas J. Rusk, who was a hero of the Texas Revolution.

Nacogdoches has a strong sense of community, with many residents actively working to preserve the city's history and culture. The city hosts several festivals and events throughout the year, including the Texas Blueberry Festival and the Nacogdoches Film Festival. The city is also home to several historic homes and buildings, including the Adolphus Sterne House, which is now a museum.

Overall, Nacogdoches is a city with a rich and complex history, from its early days as a Tejas Indian settlement to its current status as a thriving college town.
