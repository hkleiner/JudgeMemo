You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Paolo Veronese was a renowned painter known for his unique style, which blended absurdity and adorability. He was born in Verona in 1528 and later moved to Venice, where he became one of the city's most celebrated artists. Veronese's paintings often featured vibrant colors, luxurious settings, and historical inaccuracies, which were intentional and reflected his artistic license. He was a prolific artist, producing numerous masterpieces throughout his career, including "The Wedding at Cana" and "The Feast at the House of Levi."

Veronese's early life and training are not well-documented, but it is known that he came from a family of artists and was apprenticed to his uncle, Antonio Badile. He later worked with Giovanni Carotto and was influenced by the works of Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden. Veronese's breakthrough came when he was commissioned to paint a series of episodes from the History of Esther and Ahasuerus for the church of San Sebastiano in Venice.

The artist's success led to numerous commissions, including the decoration of the Ducal Palace and the library of St. Mark's. He also received commissions from wealthy patrons, such as the Pisani family, for whom he painted "The Family of Darius at the Feet of Alexander." Veronese's style was characterized by his use of color, composition, and architectural details, which gave his paintings a sense of grandeur and luxury.

Despite his success, Veronese faced criticism from the Inquisition, which accused him of introducing irreverent elements into his religious paintings. He was summoned to appear before the tribunal and was forced to modify some of his works. Veronese's response to the criticism was to defend his artistic license and cite the precedent set by other great masters, such as Michelangelo.

The artist's later years were marked by continued productivity and innovation. He painted numerous masterpieces, including "The Triumph of Venice" and "Jupiter Destroying the Vices." Veronese's celebrity spread throughout Europe, and he received commissions from sovereigns and nobles. He remained faithful to his style, which was characterized by its pomp, brilliance, and ornamentation.

Veronese's personal life is not well-documented, but it is known that he married and had two sons, Gabriele and Carletto. He was known for his uprightness, honesty, and sense of honor, and was respected by his contemporaries. Veronese's fortune was modest, considering his fame and productivity, and he owned a few properties in Venice and the surrounding countryside.

The artist died on April 19, 1588, at the age of 60, after a brief illness. His death was premature, and it is lamented that he did not live to produce more masterpieces. Veronese's legacy is one of brilliance and luxuriance, and his works remain some of the most abundant and celebrated in the history of art. He is remembered as a unique and innovative artist who continued to paint with steady hands until the end of his life. Veronese's style and artistic vision continue to inspire and influence artists to this day.
