You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned English painter born in 1723. He was destined for success, with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense. Reynolds' early life was uneventful, but his journey to Italy in 1749-1752 was invaluable, as he studied and copied the works of great masters like Michelangelo, Titian, and Rembrandt. He became a skilled portrait painter, and his return to England marked the beginning of his successful career.

Reynolds' success was not solely due to his talent, but also his ability to network and build relationships with influential people. He was a member of the Dilettanti Society and befriended notable figures like Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Goldsmith. His studio in Leicester Square was a hub for artists, writers, and intellectuals. Reynolds' portraits were highly sought after, and he was known for his ability to capture the essence of his subjects.

Despite his success, Reynolds had his flaws, including a touch of snobbery and jealousy. However, he was also kind and just, and his friendships were genuine. Reynolds' art was influenced by the great masters he studied, and he sought to unite their excellences in his own work. He was a great assimilator, taking from everyone but always judicious in his choices.

Reynolds' portraits of men are considered some of his best work, as he was able to capture their character and spirit. His portraits of women and children, while beautiful, often lacked humanity and were idealized. The painter's personal life was marked by his relationships with women, including Angelica Kaufmann, but there is no evidence to suggest that he was romantically involved with her.

Reynolds' later years were marked by his presidency of the Royal Academy, which he helped establish. He continued to paint, but his output decreased, and he eventually stopped painting due to his failing eyesight. Reynolds died in 1792, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest British portrait painters. His work continues to be admired, despite some of his canvases having lost their original tints or suffered from restoration.

Reynolds' art was not without its limitations, and some of his experiments with color and technique were not successful. However, his best works remain some of the most iconic and enduring portraits in British art. His ability to capture the character and spirit of his subjects, particularly men, has never been surpassed. Reynolds' legacy extends beyond his art, as he played a significant role in establishing the Royal Academy and promoting the arts in Britain.

Overall, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a complex and multifaceted individual, whose art and legacy continue to be celebrated and studied today. His contributions to British art and culture are immeasurable, and his portraits remain some of the most iconic and enduring works of the 18th century. Despite his flaws and limitations, Reynolds' art and legacy continue to inspire and influence artists, art historians, and enthusiasts alike.
