You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author recounts their experience as part of a movement to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands. On July 23, 1901, the United States Government sent 499 trained men and women to the islands to achieve this goal. The author describes the journey to the Philippines, including a stop in Honolulu, where they visited the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology.

Upon arrival in Manila, the author was struck by the city's cosmopolitan atmosphere and the mix of people from different cultures. They describe the city's architecture, including the old stone bridge and the church. The author also notes the challenges of living in the Philippines, including the rainy season and the need for proper housing.

The author was assigned to the town of Talisay, where they worked to establish a public school. They describe the difficulties of teaching in a new and unfamiliar environment, including the lack of resources and the need to learn the local language. Despite these challenges, the author reports that the school was eventually successful, with many students making excellent progress.

The author also describes their experiences at a "baile," a social gathering where they met with local Filipinos and observed their customs and traditions. They note the flash of diamonds and other gems worn by the women, as well as the richly colored dresses and the men's formal attire.

In addition to their work in education, the author also describes their experiences with the local culture, including a visit to a leper colony. They were struck by the poverty and suffering of the people living in the colony, but also by their resilience and dignity.

Overall, the author's account provides a vivid and detailed picture of life in the Philippines during the early 20th century. It highlights the challenges and opportunities of working in a new and unfamiliar environment, as well as the richness and diversity of the local culture. The author's experiences and observations offer a unique perspective on this period in history, and provide valuable insights into the complexities of cultural exchange and education.
