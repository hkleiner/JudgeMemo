You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a prominent English painter born in 1723. He was known for his exceptional talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career. Reynolds was not considered a genius, but rather a skilled artist who worked hard to develop his craft. He was born under a fortunate star and had a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense.

Reynolds' early life was quite uneventful, and he was apprenticed to a portrait painter in London. However, he soon quarreled with his master and returned to Devonshire, where he painted under the patronage of the first Lord Edgcumbe. It was during this time that he met Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise to the Mediterranean and introduced him to the great masterpieces of art.

Reynolds' time in Italy had a profound impact on his art, and he was particularly influenced by the works of Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens. He became a skilled copyist and was able to take the best from each artist and incorporate it into his own work. Upon his return to England, Reynolds established himself as a portrait painter and quickly gained success.

Reynolds was a member of the Royal Academy and served as its president. He was known for his discourses, which were annual lectures he gave to the academy. In these lectures, he emphasized the importance of technique and the need for artists to study the great masters. Reynolds was also a skilled writer and had a literary style that was precise and final.

Despite his success, Reynolds had his flaws. He was known to be jealous and had a touch of snobbery. However, he was also kind and just, and his friends loved him dearly. Reynolds was particularly close to Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Goldsmith, and he enjoyed the company of many other notable figures of the time.

Reynolds' art is characterized by its simplicity, directness, and expression of character. He was able to capture the essence of his sitters and convey their personalities through his portraits. His portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, are considered some of his best works. Reynolds' use of color was also notable, although some of his experiments with color did not stand the test of time.

In his later years, Reynolds continued to paint and exhibit his work. He was knighted in 1769 and became a respected figure in society. Despite his success, Reynolds remained humble and kind, and his friends and contemporaries admired him greatly. He died in 1792 at the age of 69, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest British portrait painters of all time.

Reynolds' work has stood the test of time, and he remains one of the most celebrated artists in British history. His portraits continue to be admired for their beauty, simplicity, and expression of character. Despite some criticisms of his work, Reynolds' name and fame remain the pride of British art and the admiration of the civilized world.

Overall, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a talented and influential artist who made significant contributions to the world of art. His legacy continues to be celebrated, and his portraits remain some of the most iconic and enduring works of art in British history.
