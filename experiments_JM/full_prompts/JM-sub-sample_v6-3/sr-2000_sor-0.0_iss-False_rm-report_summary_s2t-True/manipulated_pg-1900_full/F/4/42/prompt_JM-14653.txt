You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, suggesting that its magic has been lost for many adults. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it's often seen as a time of gluttony, indigestion, and expensiveness. The author argues that this change is due to the influence of skeptics and scientists who have undermined traditional beliefs and values.

The author suggests that the decline of Christmas is a symptom of a broader decline in faith and enthusiasm. However, they also argue that the idea of goodwill and mutual support is still essential to human happiness. The author proposes that Christmas can be revitalized by focusing on the cultivation of goodwill, rather than just going through the motions of traditional celebrations.

The author notes that the date of Christmas was chosen to coincide with the winter solstice, a time of renewal and hope. They suggest that the festival can be reinvigorated by emphasizing its symbolic connection to the solstice and the importance of goodwill. The author also argues that the customs of Christmas, such as present-giving and feasting, can be seen as ways of expressing and cultivating goodwill.

To cultivate goodwill, the author recommends practicing sympathetic imagination, which involves putting oneself in another person's shoes and understanding their thoughts and feelings. This can be done by regularly thinking about others, informing oneself about their activities, and reflecting on their existence with empathy.

The author suggests that the systematic cultivation of goodwill can have several consequences, including the decline of the "superior person" in oneself, an increased interest in one's friends, and a greater sense of happiness. They also note that the reaction to Christmas, which often sets in after the holiday, is inevitable and can be a time for reflection and renewal.

Ultimately, the author argues that real happiness is not something that can be achieved in the future, but rather it is an affair of the present. It consists in accepting the fact that discontent is a condition of life and endeavoring to adjust conduct to an ideal. The author concludes that life is worth living, despite its drawbacks and disappointments, and that the cultivation of goodwill and human friendship is essential to making it so. Christmas, as the Feast of St. Friend, exists to promote and celebrate these values.
