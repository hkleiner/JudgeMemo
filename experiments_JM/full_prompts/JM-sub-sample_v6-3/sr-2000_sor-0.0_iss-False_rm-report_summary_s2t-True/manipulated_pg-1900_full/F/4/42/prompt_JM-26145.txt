You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets are letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters reveal the political situation in Western Asia during the 14th century BC, with Egypt's influence waning and the rise of the Hittite empire.

The tablets also contain letters from foreign kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters show the diplomatic relations between Egypt and its neighbors, with discussions of trade, marriage alliances, and military campaigns. The letters also reveal the personalities of the kings, with Tushratta being particularly greedy for gold and Napkhuria being inexperienced and prone to making mistakes.

The tablets also contain reports from Egyptian governors and officials in Western Asia, detailing the struggles of the local princes and the encroachment of the Habiri and Sutu tribes. The letters from Aziru, a prefect of the land of the Amorites, are particularly notable for their revelations of his cunning and ambition. Other notable letters come from Rib-Addi of Gebal, who complains of the injustices done to him by Aziru, and Abi-milki of Tyre, who writes in a rhetorical style reminiscent of the Hebrew Psalter.

The tablets provide valuable insights into the history of civilization, including the political and social conditions of the time. They also contain references to the Hebrews, who are mentioned as the Habiri, and the city of Shechem, which is mentioned as Shakmi. The tablets also provide information on the geography of the region, with mentions of various cities and lands, including Ugarit, Danuna, and Kadesh.

Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are a unique and valuable source of historical information, providing a window into the politics, society, and culture of the ancient Near East. They reveal the complexities and challenges of the time, including the struggles of the local princes, the rise of the Hittite empire, and the decline of Egyptian influence in the region. The tablets also demonstrate the diplomatic and literary skills of the ancient kings and officials, with their use of rhetoric and diplomacy to achieve their goals.
