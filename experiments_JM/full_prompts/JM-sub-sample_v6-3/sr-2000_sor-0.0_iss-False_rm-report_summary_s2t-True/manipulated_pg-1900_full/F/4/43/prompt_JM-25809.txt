You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jim Felton, a miner, is struggling to find gold in Sweet Briar Gulch. He receives a letter from his lover, Anne, who refuses to marry him due to his lack of financial stability. Jim is heartbroken and feels like giving up. His friend, Bud, a mail carrier, visits him and offers to help. Bud suggests that Jim take a break and go to town, but Jim declines, feeling responsible for his claim.

Bud gives Jim some money and tells him to take care of himself. Jim decides to go to town anyway, where he meets a young boy named Ches, who is being abused by his caretakers. Jim rescues the boy and decides to take him in. The boy is grateful and promises to do anything for Jim. Jim and Ches return to the claim, where Jim starts working on a tunnel.

Ches is initially hesitant to help, but eventually starts working with Jim. They face many challenges, including a mountain lion and a rattlesnake. Despite these obstacles, they grow closer, and Jim starts to see Ches as a surrogate son. One day, the tunnel collapses, and Jim is trapped. Ches bravely rescues him with the help of some miners who happen to be passing by.

The miners, led by Captain Hanrahan, are experienced and efficient. They work quickly to rescue Jim, and eventually succeed in pulling him out of the tunnel. Jim is injured but alive, and the miners offer to help him recover. Bud stays with Jim and Ches, taking care of them and doing chores.

While Jim is recovering, he receives a letter from Anne, who has had a change of heart. She realizes that she was wrong to prioritize financial stability over love and is willing to marry Jim regardless of his circumstances. Jim is overjoyed and feels like he can finally rest easy. The story ends on a hopeful note, with Jim, Ches, and Bud looking forward to a brighter future.

The characters in the story are well-developed and complex. Jim is a rugged individualist who is driven by his passion for mining. Anne is a practical and responsible person who is initially hesitant to take risks. Ches is a young and vulnerable boy who is desperate for love and acceptance. Bud is a kind and generous friend who is always willing to help.

The story explores themes of love, friendship, and perseverance. Jim's love for Anne and his determination to succeed as a miner drive the plot forward. The friendship between Jim and Bud is also an important aspect of the story, as it provides emotional support and comfort. The story also highlights the importance of perseverance and hard work, as Jim and Ches face many challenges and obstacles in their journey.

Overall, the story is a heartwarming and inspiring tale of love, friendship, and determination. It explores complex themes and characters, and offers a hopeful and optimistic view of the world. The writing is descriptive and engaging, making it easy to become immersed in the story and care about the characters.
