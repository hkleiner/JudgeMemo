You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author embarked on an expedition to study the Sarö Yögur tribe in December 1907. They started from the Chinese town of Chin-t'a and traveled southeast, passing through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. The author met three women from the tribe, who wore a unique costume and were proud to identify themselves as Sarö Yögurs. The women were busy with household chores, while the men were mostly at home.

The author visited the village of Machuangtzu, where they met the lama Kuá, who was hospitable and talkative. The lama showed the author around the village and introduced them to the local customs and way of life. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, living in fixed abodes, and their main source of livelihood is grazing cattle. They have a simple and primitive way of life, with limited agriculture and no ironworking.

The author observed that the Sarö Yögurs have a distinctive physical appearance, with prominent cheekbones, small eyes, and straight noses. They have a unique costume, with men wearing a Chinese cap and a long coat, and women wearing a dress with a peculiar headpiece. The author also noted that the Sarö Yögurs have a limited vocabulary and no written language.

The author then traveled to the village of Kanchow, where they met the military mandarin Ma-t'idu, who provided them with a letter of introduction to the Shera Yögur tribe. The author traveled to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'anglungssu, where they met the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo. The Shera Yögurs are also a pastoral people, living in the mountains, and have a similar way of life to the Sarö Yögurs.

The author observed that the Shera Yögurs have a more complex social structure, with a system of "bones" or clans, and a more developed system of governance. They also have a unique costume, with men wearing a sheepskin coat and women wearing a distinctive headpiece. The author noted that the Shera Yögurs are skilled in weaving and making coarse blankets, but have limited knowledge of medicine and no written language.

The author spent several days with the Shera Yögurs, learning about their customs and way of life. They observed that the Shera Yögurs have a strong sense of community, with a emphasis on family and social bonds. The author also noted that the Shera Yögurs have a unique system of marriage, with the bride being bought and the agreement being made by the parents.

The author concluded their visit to the Shera Yögurs and traveled back to the town of Li-yen, where they were received with hospitality by the old mandarin. The author reflected on their experiences with the Sarö and Shera Yögurs, noting the similarities and differences between the two tribes. They also noted the challenges faced by the tribes, including poverty, limited access to education and healthcare, and the threat of extinction. Overall, the author's expedition provided valuable insights into the culture and way of life of the Sarö and Shera Yögurs, two unique and fascinating tribes.
