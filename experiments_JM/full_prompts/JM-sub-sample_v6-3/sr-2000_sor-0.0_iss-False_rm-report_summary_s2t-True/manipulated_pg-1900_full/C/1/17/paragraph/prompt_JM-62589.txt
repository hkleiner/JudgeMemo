You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl living in Plymouth with her father, who is a drunkard. One day, her father joins a group of men headed to Boston, and Debby is left behind with Mrs. Lane, who tries to care for her. However, Debby is miserable and longs for her father. She discovers that her father was wounded at Lexington and is now a patriot fighting against the British.

Debby decides to disguise herself as a boy and join the army to find her father. She takes on the name Robert Shirtliffe and becomes a drummer boy. As she travels with the army, she meets a young man named Jack Martin, who becomes her friend. Debby, now known as Robert, faces many challenges and dangers, including being wounded and nearly captured by the British.

Meanwhile, a British soldier named Morley is searching for Debby Mason, and their paths eventually cross. Morley is wounded by Robert, and as he lies dying, he asks Robert to deliver a message to his mother in London. Robert agrees and promises to tell Morley's mother that he died like a soldier.

After Morley's death, Robert is wounded again and left for dead. However, he is found by a surgeon named Doctor Bell, who nurses him back to health. As Robert recovers, he reveals his true identity as Debby Mason to Doctor Bell. Doctor Bell is kind and understanding, and he helps Debby to write a letter explaining her situation to General Washington.

Debby meets with General Washington, who is compassionate and understanding. He gives her an honorable discharge from the army and a sum of money to start a new life. Debby is grateful and decides to travel to England to meet Morley's mother. There, she discovers that Morley was her cousin, and she tells his mother the story of his bravery and death.

Morley's mother is shocked and grief-stricken, but she eventually forgives Debby and welcomes her as her own child. Debby finds a sense of belonging and family with Morley's mother and decides to stay with her. Later, Doctor Bell comes to visit Debby and declares his love for her. Debby, who has grown into a beautiful and strong woman, accepts his love, and they get married.

The story concludes with Debby, now a happy and fulfilled woman, reflecting on her past experiences and the lessons she has learned. She realizes that she has found a new family and a new sense of purpose, and she is grateful for the journey that has brought her to this point. Debby's story is one of courage, resilience, and the power of love and forgiveness to transform lives.
