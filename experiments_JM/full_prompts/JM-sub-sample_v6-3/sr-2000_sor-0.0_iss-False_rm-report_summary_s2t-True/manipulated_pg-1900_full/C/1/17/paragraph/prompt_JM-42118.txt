You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. He was raised in a family that valued commerce and thrift. Fragonard's early life was marked by a love for art, and he was eventually apprenticed to a notary. However, he soon became bored with this work and turned to painting. His mother recognized his talent and took him to Paris to meet the great painter François Boucher.

Boucher was impressed by Fragonard's work and took him on as a student. Fragonard quickly proved himself to be a talented artist, and Boucher encouraged him to compete for the Prix de Rome. Fragonard won the prize in 1752 and went on to study in Rome for three years. During his time in Rome, he was exposed to the works of great artists such as Raphael and Michelangelo.

Upon his return to Paris, Fragonard began to make a name for himself as a painter. He was known for his elegant and charming works, which often featured landscapes and scenes of everyday life. He became a favorite among the aristocracy and was commissioned to paint several works for the royal family.

Fragonard's personal life was also flourishing. He married Marie Anne Gérard, a young woman from Grasse, and the couple had two children together. Fragonard's wife was not a great beauty, but she was kind and loving, and the couple was happy together.

As the years passed, Fragonard's career continued to soar. He became one of the most popular painters in France, and his works were highly sought after by collectors. He was also a talented decorator and designed several interiors for wealthy clients.

However, Fragonard's success was not without its challenges. He faced criticism from some who felt that his works were too frivolous and lacking in depth. Despite this, he remained committed to his art and continued to paint with passion and dedication.

The French Revolution had a profound impact on Fragonard's life and career. Many of his patrons were aristocrats who were forced to flee or were executed during the Reign of Terror. Fragonard himself was not immune to the dangers of the time and was forced to flee Paris to avoid persecution.

He returned to Grasse, where he lived in exile for several years. During this time, he continued to paint, but his works were no longer in demand. He was forced to sell many of his possessions to make ends meet.

Eventually, Fragonard returned to Paris, where he lived out the remainder of his days. He continued to paint, but his works were no longer as highly regarded as they once had been. He died on August 22, 1806, at the age of 74.

Despite his struggles and challenges, Fragonard left behind a legacy of beautiful and charming works. His paintings continue to be celebrated for their elegance and charm, and he remains one of the most beloved artists of the 18th century. Fragonard's art embodies the spirit of the French Rococo period, and his works are a testament to the enduring power of beauty and elegance.

Fragonard's wife, Marie Anne, lived to be 77 years old and died in 1824. His sister-in-law, Marguerite Gérard, also had a successful career as an artist and lived to be 76 years old. She never married and died in 1837.

Fragonard's story is a testament to the power of art to transcend time and circumstance. Despite the challenges and hardships he faced, he remained committed to his craft and continued to create beautiful works of art. His legacy continues to inspire and delight people to this day.
