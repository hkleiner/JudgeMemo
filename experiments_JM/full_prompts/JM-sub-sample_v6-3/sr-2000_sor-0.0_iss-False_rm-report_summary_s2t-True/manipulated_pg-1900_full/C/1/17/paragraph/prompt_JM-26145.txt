You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reign of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The discovery revealed that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, as well as from Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch.

The letters provided insight into the political conditions of the time, including the struggles of the Egyptian government to maintain control over its Asiatic provinces. The provinces enjoyed self-government, but the disadvantages of this condition were evident in the numerous letters requesting aid from the king. The native princes and chiefs were constantly at odds with each other, and the immigration of Bedawin tribes added to the chaos.

The Egyptian court and administration during this period were marked by a shift in power dynamics. Pharaoh Amenophis III was more focused on building and cultivating "wisdom" than on war, while his son Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion centered on the worship of the sun disk, Aten. This led to a conflict with the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, resulting in the removal of the court to Tell el Amarna.

The letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani, revealed the complexities of diplomatic relations during this period. The kings sought to maintain alliances and trade relationships with Egypt, often through marriage and gift exchanges. However, the Egyptian pharaohs were reluctant to give away their daughters in marriage, and the relationships were often marked by tension and competition.

The letters from Asiatic vassals, including Aziru and Rib-Addi, provided insight into the struggles of the Egyptian government to maintain control over its provinces. The vassals often complained about the actions of their neighbors and requested aid from the king. The letters also revealed the complexities of the relationships between the vassals and the Egyptian government, including the use of diplomacy, trade, and military force.

The Tell el Amarna period was marked by significant political and social changes, including the rise of the Hittite empire and the decline of the Mitani kingdom. The period also saw the introduction of new religious ideas and the development of complex diplomatic relationships between the major powers of the time. The discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets has provided valuable insights into the history of the ancient Near East and the complexities of international relations during this period.

Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets offer a unique window into the politics, society, and culture of the ancient Near East during the 14th century B.C. The letters provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the complexities of international relations, diplomacy, and trade during this period, and have significantly expanded our knowledge of the history of the region.
