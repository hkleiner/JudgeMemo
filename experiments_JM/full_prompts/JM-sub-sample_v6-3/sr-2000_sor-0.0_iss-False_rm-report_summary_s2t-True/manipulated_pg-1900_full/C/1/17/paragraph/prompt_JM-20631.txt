You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of Judaism. The foreword discusses the life and work of Arthur Davis, a scholar of Hebrew who founded a series of lectures on Hebraic thought and learning. Davis was a self-taught expert in Hebrew and wrote several books, including "The Hebrew Accents of the Twenty-one Books of the Bible." He also worked on a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book and transmitted his knowledge to his daughters.

The concept of a chosen people has been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some viewing it as a claim of spiritual supremacy. However, the book argues that this concept is not unique to Judaism and can be found in other cultures and religions. The idea of a chosen people is often tied to a sense of mission and purpose, with the chosen people seen as having a special role to play in the world.

The book also explores the idea of a "ritual language," which is a language used for religious purposes that may not be spoken in everyday life. Examples of ritual languages include Church Slavonic, Sanscrit, and Geez. The use of ritual languages can create a sense of mystery and awe, and can also serve to maintain the authority of the priesthood.

The concept of a chosen people is not limited to Judaism, and can be found in other cultures and religions. For example, the German people have also developed a doctrine of special election, with some viewing themselves as the chosen people of God. However, this doctrine has been perverted in Germany, with the emphasis on militarism and aggression rather than peace and righteousness.

The book argues that the concept of a chosen people is not necessarily a bad thing, but rather a natural expression of a group's sense of identity and purpose. However, when this concept is tied to a sense of superiority or aggression, it can become problematic. The book concludes by suggesting that the concept of a chosen people can be a positive force when it is tied to a sense of mission and purpose, but that it must be balanced with a sense of humility and respect for others.

In the context of Judaism, the concept of a chosen people is closely tied to the idea of a covenant between God and the Jewish people. This covenant is seen as a sacred trust, with the Jewish people having a special role to play in the world. However, this concept has been misunderstood and distorted over time, with some viewing it as a claim of superiority rather than a call to service.

The book also explores the idea of "Recessional," or the tendency for a group to reflect on its own flaws and weaknesses. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of Judaism, where the prophets and historians have long been critical of their own people's shortcomings. In contrast, the German people have often been criticized for their lack of self-reflection and tendency to glorify their own nation.

Overall, the book "Chosen Peoples" offers a nuanced and thought-provoking exploration of the concept of a chosen people, and its implications for our understanding of identity, purpose, and mission. By examining the concept of a chosen people in a variety of contexts, the book provides a rich and detailed analysis of this complex and multifaceted idea. The book concludes by suggesting that the concept of a chosen people can be a powerful force for good, but that it must be approached with humility and respect for others.
