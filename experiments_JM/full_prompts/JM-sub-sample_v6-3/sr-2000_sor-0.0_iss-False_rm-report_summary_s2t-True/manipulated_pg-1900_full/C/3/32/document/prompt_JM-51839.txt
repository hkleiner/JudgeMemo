You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Nacogdoches, Texas, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. The city was founded by Antonio Gil Ybarbo in 1779 and was a key location for the Spanish, French, and Mexican governments. The area was originally inhabited by the Tejas Indians, who had a complex society with their own traditions and customs. In 1716, the Spanish established the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, which marked the beginning of European settlement in the area.

The city played a significant role in the Texas Revolution, with many prominent figures, including Sam Houston and Thomas J. Rusk, living and operating in the area. The Old Stone Fort, built by Ybarbo in 1779, served as a trading post, a military outpost, and even a home for some of the city's early residents. The fort was also the site of several key events, including the Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832.

Nacogdoches was a major commercial center, with trade connections to other parts of Texas and the United States. The city's economy was driven by agriculture, with cotton and other crops being major exports. The city also had a significant cultural scene, with several newspapers, schools, and churches being established in the 19th century.

The city's history is marked by several significant events, including the Fredonian Rebellion, the Texas Revolution, and the Civil War. The city suffered significantly during the Civil War, with many of its buildings and infrastructure being destroyed. However, the city was rebuilt in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with many new businesses and institutions being established.

Today, Nacogdoches is a thriving city with a rich history and culture. The city is home to Stephen F. Austin State University, which was established in 1917. The university is located on the site of the old Nacogdoches University, which was founded in 1845. The city is also home to several historic sites, including the Old Stone Fort, the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, and the Oak Grove Cemetery, which is the final resting place of several prominent Texans, including Thomas J. Rusk and Charles S. Taylor.

The city's historic downtown area features several buildings from the 19th century, including the Old North Church, which was built in 1838. The city is also home to several museums, including the Nacogdoches Historic Sites Museum and the Stephen F. Austin State University Museum. The city's historic sites and museums offer a glimpse into the city's rich history and culture, and provide a unique perspective on the events and people that shaped the city into what it is today.

Overall, Nacogdoches is a city with a deep and complex history, marked by significant events, cultural achievements, and economic developments. The city's rich history and culture make it a unique and fascinating place to visit and live. The city's historic sites, museums, and cultural institutions offer a glimpse into the city's past, and provide a sense of connection to the people and events that shaped the city into what it is today.
