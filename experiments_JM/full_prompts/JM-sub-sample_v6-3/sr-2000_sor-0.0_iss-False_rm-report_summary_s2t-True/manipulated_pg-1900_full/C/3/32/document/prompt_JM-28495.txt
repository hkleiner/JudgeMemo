You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, trying to find the Home for Lost Dogs in Battersea to adopt a dog. They follow a man who they think works at the home, but he leads them on a wild goose chase. Eventually, they give up and go home. That evening, while walking across the golf course, they find a small, wet puppy with a brick attached to it by a string. They decide to keep the puppy and name it Excalibur, or Scally for short.

As Scally grows up, he becomes a beloved member of the family. He is a large and clumsy dog, but he is gentle and affectionate. The narrator's sister-in-law, Eileen, takes care of Scally and teaches him to walk on a leash. Scally becomes a regular companion to Eileen and the narrator's wife, Stella.

One day, while out on a walk, Scally meets a young curate named Gerald Gilmore. Gerald is immediately smitten with Eileen, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Scally becomes a frequent companion to the couple and helps to bring them together.

As the years pass, Gerald and Eileen's relationship deepens, but they face challenges due to Gerald's limited income as a curate. Despite this, they are happy together, and Scally remains a loyal and beloved member of the family.

Tragedy strikes when the narrator falls ill, and the family must make changes. Eileen decides to send Scally to live with Gerald, who has been transferred to a new parish in the north. Scally is overjoyed to be reunited with Gerald and quickly settles into his new life.

Gerald and Scally have many adventures together, including a train crash in which they help to rescue people. Gerald's bravery and selflessness during the crash earn him recognition, and he is eventually offered a new position as a rector.

The story jumps forward in time, and we see Gerald and Eileen married with two children. They are living in a comfortable rectory, and Scally is still a beloved member of the family. One day, a tramp comes to the door, and Eileen uses Scally to chase him away.

Throughout the story, Scally is a constant presence, providing companionship and comfort to those around him. He is a symbol of the joy and love that pets can bring to our lives, and his story is a heartwarming tale of friendship and devotion.
