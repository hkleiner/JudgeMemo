You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a young painter born in 1822 to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a drawing master who struggled to make a living, and her mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician. Rosa's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but she showed a talent for art from a young age. She began drawing and painting at the age of four and was largely self-taught. 

Rosa's family moved to Paris when she was seven years old, and she was enrolled in a boys' school, where she developed boyish manners and a love for animals. Her father encouraged her artistic talents, and she began to study anatomy and sketch animals. Rosa's first painting was a still life of cherries, which her father praised, encouraging her to continue pursuing art.

As Rosa grew older, she became more serious about her art, spending hours studying and sketching at the Louvre. She developed a passion for painting animals and began to build a reputation as a talented young artist. In 1841, she submitted two works to the Salon, which were accepted, and she continued to exhibit her work annually.

Rosa's success grew, and she became known for her realistic and detailed paintings of animals. She was particularly drawn to horses and cattle, and her paintings often featured these animals in naturalistic settings. In 1845, she was awarded a third-class medal at the Salon, and her reputation continued to grow.

In 1849, Rosa's painting "Ploughing in the Nivernais" was purchased by the French government, and she became a celebrated artist. She continued to paint and exhibit her work, and in 1853, she was awarded a first-class medal at the Salon. Rosa's success was not limited to France; she also gained recognition in England and other countries.

Rosa's personal life was marked by a deep friendship with Nathalie Micas, who became her companion and confidante. The two women lived together, and Nathalie managed Rosa's household and helped her with her art. Rosa never married and dedicated her life to her art.

In 1865, Rosa was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and she continued to paint and exhibit her work until her death in 1899. Throughout her life, Rosa remained committed to her art and her values, and she left behind a legacy as one of the greatest animal painters of all time.

Rosa's later years were marked by a decline in her friend Nathalie's health, and she cared for her until Nathalie's death in 1889. Rosa was devastated by the loss, but she continued to paint, producing some of her most famous works, including "The Duel" and "The Threshing of the Grain."

Rosa's death in 1899 was mourned by the art world, and she was remembered as a talented and dedicated artist who had left an indelible mark on the world of art. Her legacy continues to be celebrated, and her paintings remain some of the most beloved and respected works of animal art. 

Rosa Bonheur's life was a testament to her passion, dedication, and perseverance. She remained true to her art and her values, and her work continues to inspire and delight audiences around the world. Her story is a reminder that with hard work and determination, anything is possible, and that art can be a powerful tool for self-expression and connection.
