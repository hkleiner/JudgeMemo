You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The document "One Common Faith" discusses the role of religion in addressing the spiritual and moral crisis facing humanity. The authors argue that the world's religious leaders must find the courage to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of religion. The time has come for religious leadership to face the implications of the truth that God is one and that religion is likewise one. 

The interfaith movement has been sustained by the recognition of this truth, but it must operate at the heart of religious discourse. The authors express conviction that the principle of the oneness of religion has the capacity to ensure the continuing relevance of the great revealed faiths. 

The response to the message has been encouraging, with many recipients expressing distress over the failure of religious institutions to assist humanity in dealing with spiritual and moral challenges. Discussions have turned to the need for fundamental change in the way people relate to one another. 

The authors argue that the task of ensuring that the message is engaged by people everywhere is one that has been laid primarily on the shoulders of those who have recognized the truth. The accelerating breakdown in social order calls out desperately for the religious spirit to be freed from the shackles that have prevented it from bringing to bear its healing influence. 

The document also discusses the need for a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves. The writings of Bahá'u'lláh provide insights that can help elevate discussion of religious issues above sectarian and transient considerations. 

The authors note that the period of history now opening will be far more receptive to efforts to spread the message than was the case in the past century. The materialistic interpretation of reality that dominated the twentieth century has been discredited, and a sea change in human consciousness is underway. 

The reawakened interest in religion is far from having reached its peak, and the phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum. The most obvious cause of these re-evaluations has been the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise itself. 

The document also explores the concept of progressive revelation, which places the ultimate emphasis on recognition of the revelation of God at its appearance. The failure of the generality of humankind to recognize the revelation has condemned entire populations to a ritualistic repetition of ordinances and practices long after they have fulfilled their purpose. 

The authors argue that the power through which the goals of unity and global cooperation will be progressively realized is that of unity itself. Unity is a condition of the human spirit, and education and legislation can support and enhance it, but they can do so only once it emerges and has established itself as a compelling force in social life. 

The Bahá'í community has achieved a sense of identity as members of a single human race, and its unity has been maintained unbroken and unimpaired through the most vulnerable early stages of its existence. The community's example of unity is a powerful testimony to the validity of Bahá'u'lláh's mission and a source of hope for a world beset by disunity and conflict. 

Ultimately, the document concludes that the task of sharing the message is not an interfaith project, but rather a call to individuals to recognize the truth and to commit themselves to the vision of unity embodied in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh. The goal of the message is to bring about a universal civilization shaped by principles of social justice and enriched by achievements of the human mind and spirit. 

The authors emphasize that service to this goal calls for an understanding of the fundamental difference distinguishing the mission of Bahá'u'lláh from political and ideological projects of human design. The moral vacuum that produced the horrors of the twentieth century exposed the outermost limits of the mind's unaided capacity to devise and construct an ideal society. 

The document ends with a call to action, urging individuals to recognize the truth and to commit themselves to the vision of unity embodied in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh. The process of building a universal civilization bears within itself the assurance of its fulfilment, and the new creation is today everywhere emerging.
