You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of Judaism. The foreword, written by Herbert Samuel, introduces the series of lectures in memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar of Hebrew language and literature. Davis was a self-taught expert who made significant contributions to the field, including a volume on Hebrew accents and a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book.

The first chapter discusses the idea of a chosen people and how it has been perceived by others, including the ancient Greeks and Romans. The author argues that the concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism and that other nations, such as Germany, have also claimed a special status.

The second chapter examines the biblical concept of a chosen people and how it has been interpreted throughout history. The author suggests that the idea of a chosen people is not about superiority, but rather about a special mission or purpose. The chapter also explores the tension between particularism and universalism in Jewish thought.

The third chapter discusses the post-biblical development of Jewish thought, including the Talmud and the work of medieval scholars such as Maimonides. The author argues that Jewish thought has evolved over time, incorporating new ideas and influences while remaining true to its core principles.

The fourth chapter explores the concept of election in Jewish thought, including the idea that Israel is a chosen people. The author argues that this concept is not about arrogance or superiority, but rather about a sense of responsibility and mission. The chapter also discusses the relationship between Israel and other nations, including the idea that Israel is a light unto the nations.

The fifth chapter compares the concept of a chosen people in Judaism with similar ideas in other cultures, including ancient Egypt and Japan. The author argues that the idea of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism and that other nations have also claimed a special status.

The sixth chapter discusses the German concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of nationalism and militarism. The author argues that the German idea of a chosen people is distinct from the Jewish concept and is rooted in a desire for power and dominance.

The seventh chapter reflects on the current state of the world and the need for a new sense of purpose and mission. The author argues that Judaism has a unique contribution to make to this effort, particularly in its emphasis on social justice and compassion.

The eighth chapter concludes the book by emphasizing the importance of Jewish values and principles in shaping a better world. The author argues that Judaism has a critical role to play in promoting peace, justice, and understanding, and that its message is more relevant now than ever.

The afterword, written by Dr. Israel Abrahams, pays tribute to Arthur Davis and his contributions to Jewish scholarship. Abrahams reflects on Davis's love of learning and his commitment to the study of Hebrew language and literature. He also notes Davis's role as a teacher and mentor, particularly in his work with his daughters. Overall, the book "Chosen Peoples" offers a nuanced and thoughtful exploration of the concept of a chosen people, highlighting its complexities and challenges while emphasizing its ongoing relevance and importance.
