You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. He grew up in a romantic and beautiful environment, which later influenced his art. Fragonard's father wanted him to pursue a career in commerce, but he was drawn to art. At 16, he moved to Paris to study art under François Boucher, a renowned painter. Boucher recognized Fragonard's talent and encouraged him to compete for the Prix de Rome, which he won in 1752.

Fragonard then studied under Charles-Joseph Natoire in Rome, where he developed his skills and style. He returned to Paris in 1761 and began to gain recognition as an artist. Fragonard's art was characterized by its elegance, charm, and attention to detail. He became known for his landscapes and decorative paintings, which were highly sought after by the nobility and wealthy merchants.

In 1769, Fragonard married Marie Anne Gérard, and they had two children together. He continued to paint and decorate homes, including the luxurious pavilion of Luciennes for Madame du Barry. Fragonard's art was influenced by the Dutch landscapists, and he incorporated elements of their style into his work. He also excelled in painting miniatures and was known for his ability to capture the beauty of everyday life.

Fragonard's career was marked by his association with the French royal court, particularly during the reign of Louis XV. He was granted a studio and apartments at the Louvre, where he lived with his family. However, with the outbreak of the French Revolution, Fragonard's life and career were disrupted. He was forced to flee Paris and seek refuge in Grasse, where he continued to paint and decorate homes.

Fragonard returned to Paris after the Revolution and attempted to adapt to the new artistic styles and trends. However, he struggled to regain his former success and recognition. He died on August 22, 1806, at the age of 74, and was buried in the cemetery of Montmartre. Fragonard's legacy as an artist was rediscovered in the 19th century, and his work is now considered some of the most beautiful and elegant of the 18th century.

Fragonard's art embodies the spirit of 18th-century France, with its emphasis on elegance, charm, and beauty. His paintings continue to delight and inspire art lovers to this day. Despite the challenges and disruptions he faced during his lifetime, Fragonard remained a prolific and talented artist, leaving behind a legacy of stunning works that continue to be celebrated and admired. His story serves as a testament to the enduring power of art and the human spirit.
