You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet was a prominent painter of peasant life, known for his profound and sympathetic renderings of everyday life. He was born on October 4, 1814, in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, to a peasant family. Millet's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was encouraged by his family to pursue his artistic talents. He began drawing at a young age and was eventually sent to Paris to study art.

Millet's time in Paris was marked by poverty and struggle, but he persevered and continued to develop his craft. He was influenced by the works of Andrea Mantegna and Michelangelo, and he developed a unique style that was characterized by simplicity, sincerity, and a deep understanding of the human condition. Despite facing criticism and rejection, Millet remained true to his vision and continued to paint the scenes and people that inspired him.

In 1849, Millet moved to Barbizon, a small village on the outskirts of Paris, where he joined a community of artists who shared his passion for nature and simplicity. It was during this period that he created some of his most famous works, including "The Sower" and "The Gleaners." Millet's paintings were not widely recognized during his lifetime, but he continued to paint, driven by his passion for art and his desire to capture the beauty and dignity of everyday life.

Millet's art is characterized by its simplicity, sincerity, and depth of feeling. He was a master of capturing the play of light and shadow, and his paintings are marked by a sense of tranquility and peace. Despite his struggles and hardships, Millet remained committed to his art, and he continued to paint until his death on January 20, 1875.

Today, Millet is recognized as one of the greatest painters of the 19th century, and his works are celebrated for their beauty, simplicity, and profound insight into the human condition. His influence can be seen in the works of many other artists, including Segantini, who was inspired by Millet's example. Millet's legacy is a testament to the power of art to capture the essence of human experience and to inspire future generations.

Millet's paintings are not just beautiful works of art, but also a window into the lives of the people he depicted. He showed the world the dignity and beauty of everyday life, and he inspired a new generation of artists to follow in his footsteps. His art is a reminder that beauty can be found in the simplest things, and that the human experience is worthy of celebration and reverence.

In addition to his paintings, Millet also created many drawings and etchings, which are characterized by their spontaneity and virility. These works offer a unique glimpse into Millet's creative process and demonstrate his mastery of a range of artistic mediums. Overall, Millet's art is a testament to his genius, his passion, and his commitment to capturing the beauty and dignity of everyday life.
