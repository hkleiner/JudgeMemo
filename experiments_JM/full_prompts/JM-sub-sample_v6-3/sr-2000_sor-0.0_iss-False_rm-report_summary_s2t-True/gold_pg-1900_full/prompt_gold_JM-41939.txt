You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a French painter born in 1822 to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a drawing master who struggled to make a living, and her mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician. Rosa's early life was marked by poverty and frequent moves, but she was encouraged by her parents to pursue her artistic talents. She began drawing and painting at a young age and was largely self-taught.

Rosa's father eventually settled in Paris, where she was able to study the works of the great masters at the Louvre. She developed a passion for painting animals and spent hours observing and sketching them at farms and slaughterhouses. Her hard work and dedication paid off, and she began to gain recognition for her art.

In 1841, Rosa's paintings were accepted into the Salon, a prestigious art exhibition in Paris. She continued to exhibit her work at the Salon, and her reputation grew. She became known for her realistic and detailed depictions of animals, particularly horses and cattle.

Rosa's personal life was marked by a close relationship with her friend and companion, Nathalie Micas. The two women lived together and shared a love of art and nature. Rosa also had a number of other friends and admirers, including the art dealer Mr. Gambard, who helped to promote her work.

In 1855, Rosa was awarded the grand medal of honor at the Universal Exposition in Paris. She continued to paint and exhibit her work, and her reputation spread internationally. She became one of the most celebrated artists of her time, known for her technical skill and her ability to capture the beauty and spirit of the natural world.

Rosa was also a pioneer for women in the art world. She was one of the first women to be awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and she paved the way for future generations of female artists. Despite her success, Rosa remained humble and dedicated to her craft. She continued to paint until her death in 1899, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful and enduring works of art.

Rosa's later years were marked by personal tragedy, including the loss of her beloved friend Nathalie Micas. However, she found comfort in her work and in her relationships with other artists and friends. She remained productive and creative until the end of her life, and her art continues to be celebrated and admired today.

Rosa Bonheur's life was a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and passion. She overcame numerous challenges and obstacles to achieve her goals, and her art remains a lasting tribute to her talent and perseverance. Her legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers around the world, and her paintings remain some of the most beautiful and iconic works of the 19th century.
