You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, suggesting that its magic has been lost for many adults. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and joy, but now it's often seen as a time of gluttony, expensiveness, and obligation. The author argues that this change is due to the increasing skepticism and disillusionment of the age, which has led to a decline in faith and enthusiasm.

The author suggests that the cause of this decline is the work of idealists, such as scientists and philosophers, who have sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. While their discoveries have been important, they have also led to a loss of faith in traditional beliefs and institutions.

Despite this, the author argues that the idea of goodwill and mutual support is still essential to human happiness and that Christmas can be a time to cultivate this spirit. The festival of Christmas, with its traditions and customs, can be a powerful symbol of goodwill and a reminder of the importance of human connection.

The author also suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas spirit is to focus on the cultivation of goodwill, rather than just going through the motions of traditional customs. This can be done by practicing sympathetic imagination, putting oneself in others' shoes, and trying to understand their perspectives and feelings.

By cultivating goodwill, individuals can create a more positive and supportive community, and Christmas can become a time of genuine joy and connection. The author argues that this is not just a sentimental or idealistic goal, but a practical and necessary one, given the challenges and uncertainties of life.

Ultimately, the author suggests that the true meaning of Christmas is not just about gifts, food, or festivities, but about the cultivation of goodwill and the recognition of our shared humanity. By embracing this spirit, individuals can create a more compassionate and supportive world, and find greater happiness and fulfillment in their own lives.

The author also notes that the reaction after Christmas, between Christmas and the New Year, is inevitable and that people often feel discouraged and dissatisfied with their lives. However, this can be a time for reflection and renewal, and for setting new goals and resolutions.

The author concludes that real happiness is not something that can be achieved in the future, but rather it is an inward state of mind that can be cultivated in the present. It consists of accepting the fact that discontent is a condition of life and endeavoring to adjust conduct to an ideal. The author suggests that life is worth living, despite its drawbacks and disappointments, and that the golden moments of life and the experiences of human friendship make it worthwhile.
