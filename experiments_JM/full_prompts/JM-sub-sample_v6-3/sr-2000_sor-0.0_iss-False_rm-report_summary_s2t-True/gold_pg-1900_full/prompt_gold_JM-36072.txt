You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change and progress in England. The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on the country, bringing about rapid economic growth and urbanization. However, this growth was accompanied by social and economic problems, including poverty, inequality, and exploitation of workers. The aristocracy, who had previously held power, began to lose their influence, and a new middle class emerged.

The Victorian era was also marked by significant intellectual and cultural developments. The Romantic movement, which emphasized emotion and individualism, gave way to a more rational and scientific approach to life. Writers such as Charles Dickens, the Brontë sisters, and Alfred Tennyson produced works that reflected the social and economic changes of the time.

Despite the many advances of the Victorian era, there were also significant challenges and criticisms. Social reformers such as Carlyle and Ruskin argued that the pursuit of wealth and material progress had led to a decline in moral and spiritual values. The poor and working classes continued to suffer from poverty, poor living conditions, and limited access to education and healthcare.

The Victorian era was also marked by significant political developments, including the expansion of the British Empire and the growth of nationalism. The Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867 extended the franchise and helped to establish a more democratic system of government. However, the era was also marked by social unrest, including the Chartist movement and the rise of trade unionism.

In terms of literature, the Victorian era was a time of great creativity and innovation. Writers such as Dickens, Thackeray, and the Brontë sisters produced works that are still widely read and studied today. The era also saw the emergence of new literary forms, such as the novel and the essay.

The Victorian era came to an end with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. However, its legacy continues to be felt today, and it remains one of the most significant and influential periods in English history. The era's emphasis on progress, innovation, and social reform helped to shape the modern world, and its literature and culture continue to be celebrated and studied around the globe.

Overall, the Victorian era was a complex and multifaceted period that was marked by significant social, economic, and cultural changes. While it was a time of great progress and innovation, it was also a time of significant challenge and criticism. The era's legacy continues to be felt today, and it remains an important and fascinating topic of study and discussion.

The Victorian Age was also a time of great scientific and technological progress, with significant advances in fields such as medicine, engineering, and physics. The era saw the development of new technologies, such as the steam engine and the telegraph, which helped to transform the economy and society.

In addition, the Victorian era was marked by significant developments in the arts, including the emergence of new forms of music, art, and architecture. The era saw the rise of great composers such as Brahms and Wagner, and the development of new artistic movements such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau.

Despite the many advances of the Victorian era, it was also a time of significant social and economic inequality. The poor and working classes continued to suffer from poverty, poor living conditions, and limited access to education and healthcare. The era saw the rise of social reform movements, such as the Chartist movement and the trade union movement, which sought to address these inequalities and promote social justice.

Overall, the Victorian era was a complex and multifaceted period that was marked by significant social, economic, and cultural changes. While it was a time of great progress and innovation, it was also a time of significant challenge and criticism. The era's legacy continues to be felt today, and it remains an important and fascinating topic of study and discussion.
