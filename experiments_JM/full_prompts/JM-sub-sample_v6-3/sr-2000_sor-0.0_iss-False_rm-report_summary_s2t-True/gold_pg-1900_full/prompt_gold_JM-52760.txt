You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Civil War had been ongoing for over three years by June 1864, with most fighting occurring in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals attempting to capture Richmond, none had succeeded. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan came closest in 1862, but was repulsed. The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the Union failing to deliver a decisive blow against the Army of Northern Virginia.

In the West, the Union had more success, capturing Vicksburg and Chattanooga. The beginning of 1864 found the Northern armies in a stronger position, with more resources and a greater possibility of splitting the Southern states. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given responsibility for all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction to the military operations.

The Union plan called for a two-pronged attack, with Grant focusing on Richmond and Petersburg, while Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman marched to the sea. The Army of the James, led by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast. The city of Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub, with several roads and railroads connecting it to Richmond and the South.

The Confederate defenses around Petersburg, known as the "Dimmock Line," were 10 miles long and protected all but the northern approaches to the city. On June 15, 1864, the Union XVIII Corps launched a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line, capturing several positions and pushing the Confederates back. However, the Confederates were able to regroup and hold their new line.

The Union army continued to push the Confederates back, extending their siege lines around the city. On July 30, 1864, the Union launched a massive assault on the Confederate lines, known as the Battle of the Crater. The assault failed, with the Union suffering heavy losses. The Confederates were able to hold their lines, but at great cost.

In August 1864, the Union launched a series of attacks on the Weldon Railroad, a crucial supply line for the Confederates. The Confederates were able to repel the attacks, but the Union was eventually able to capture the railroad. The Union continued to push the Confederates back, extending their siege lines and capturing key positions.

In March 1865, the Confederates launched a desperate attack on the Union lines, known as the Battle of Fort Stedman. The attack failed, with the Confederates suffering heavy losses. The Union responded by launching a series of attacks on the Confederate lines, eventually breaking through and capturing the city of Petersburg.

On April 2, 1865, the Union launched a final assault on the Confederate lines, capturing the city of Petersburg and forcing the Confederates to retreat. The Confederates abandoned the city, and the Union army pursued them, eventually capturing Richmond. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War.

The Army of Northern Virginia, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, surrendered to the Union army on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House. The surrender marked the effective end of the Civil War, with all Confederate forces surrendering by early June 1865. The Petersburg campaign had been a long and bloody one, with both sides suffering heavy losses. However, the Union's superior resources and manpower had ultimately led to their victory.
