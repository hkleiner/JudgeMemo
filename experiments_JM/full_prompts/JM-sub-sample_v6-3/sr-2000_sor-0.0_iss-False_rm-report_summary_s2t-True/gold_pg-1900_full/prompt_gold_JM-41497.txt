You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a prominent English painter born in 1723. He was known for his exceptional talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career. Reynolds was born under a fortunate star and had a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense. He was apprenticed to Thomas Hudson, a portrait painter, and later traveled to Italy, where he studied the works of great masters, including Michelangelo, Titian, and Rembrandt.

Reynolds' time in Italy had a profound impact on his art, and he became one of the greatest portrait painters of his time. He was elected as the first President of the Royal Academy, which was founded in 1768. Reynolds was a great assimilator, taking inspiration from various artists, but he also had a critical gift that allowed him to appreciate the beauties of a masterpiece while recognizing its defects.

Reynolds' art was characterized by its harmony of color and line, and he was particularly skilled at capturing the character and personality of his sitters. He was known for his portraits of men, which were considered to be his strongest works. Reynolds' portraits of women and children, on the other hand, were often idealized and lacked a sense of humanity.

Despite his success, Reynolds faced challenges, including the fading of his colors and the cracking of his canvases. He also had to deal with criticism and rivalry from other artists, including Thomas Gainsborough and George Romney. Reynolds was a member of the Dilettanti Society and was friends with notable figures, including Dr. Johnson, David Garrick, and Edmund Burke.

Reynolds' later years were marked by a decline in his health, and he eventually lost his sight. He delivered his final address to the students of the Royal Academy in 1790 and died in 1792 at the age of 69. Reynolds' legacy is still celebrated today, and he is considered one of the greatest portrait painters in British history. His work continues to inspire artists and art lovers alike, and his influence can be seen in the many portraits that he created during his lifetime.

Reynolds' portraits are characterized by their simplicity, directness, and expression of character. He was able to capture the essence of his sitters, and his portraits continue to be admired for their beauty and insight. Despite the challenges he faced, Reynolds remained a prominent figure in the art world, and his work continues to be celebrated for its technical skill and artistic merit.

In addition to his portraits, Reynolds was also known for his discourses, which were annual lectures that he delivered to the students of the Royal Academy. These lectures provide valuable insights into Reynolds' thoughts on art and his approach to painting. Reynolds' discourses are still studied today, and they continue to be an important part of his legacy.

Overall, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a remarkable artist who made significant contributions to the world of art. His portraits continue to be admired for their beauty and insight, and his influence can be seen in the many artists who have followed in his footsteps.
