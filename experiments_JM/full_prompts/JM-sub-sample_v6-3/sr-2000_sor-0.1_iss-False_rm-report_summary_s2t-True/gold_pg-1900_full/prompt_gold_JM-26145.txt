You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Tell el Amarna tablets were discovered in 1888 in Middle Egypt, containing clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform. The tablets were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV. The majority of the tablets are letters from Egyptian officials in Syria and Canaan, addressed to the king. The letters reveal the political situation in Western Asia, with various kingdoms and city-states vying for power.

Amenophis III was a powerful pharaoh who expanded Egypt's borders, but his son Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new religion and moved the capital to Tell el Amarna. The new religion, centered on the worship of the sun disk Aten, was seen as heretical by the traditional priests of Amon. Akhenaten's reforms led to a decline in Egypt's power and influence in Western Asia.

The tablets contain letters from various Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylonia and Tushratta of Mitani. These letters reveal the complex web of alliances and rivalries between the different kingdoms. The kings of Mitani and Babylonia sought to maintain good relations with Egypt, but also pursued their own interests and sought to expand their territories.

The tablets also contain letters from Egyptian vassals in Canaan, who reported on the political situation and requested help from the pharaoh. The vassals were often at odds with each other, and the pharaoh's responses were sometimes inadequate or ineffective. The letters reveal a picture of a complex and unstable political landscape, with various factions and interest groups vying for power.

One of the most notable correspondents was Aziru, a powerful vassal who sought to expand his territory and influence. He was eventually summoned to the pharaoh's court, but managed to evade punishment and maintain his power. Other notable figures included Rib-Addi of Gebal, who complained about the actions of Aziru and sought help from the pharaoh.

The tablets also contain references to the Habiri, a group of people who were seen as a threat to the stability of the region. The Habiri were likely a group of nomadic or semi-nomadic people who were seeking to expand their territory and influence. The tablets also mention the Hittites, who were a powerful kingdom in central Anatolia and were expanding their territory into Syria.

The Tell el Amarna period came to an end with the death of Akhenaten in 1370 B.C. The city of Tell el Amarna was abandoned, and the tablets were buried in the earth, where they remained until their discovery in the 19th century. The tablets provide a unique window into the politics and society of the ancient Near East, and offer insights into the complex web of alliances and rivalries that shaped the region. Overall, the Tell el Amarna tablets are an important historical resource that sheds light on a fascinating and complex period in ancient history.
