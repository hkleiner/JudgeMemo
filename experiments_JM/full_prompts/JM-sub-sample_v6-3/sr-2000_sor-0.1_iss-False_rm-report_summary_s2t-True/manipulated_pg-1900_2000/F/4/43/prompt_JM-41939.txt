# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born on March 16, 1822, in Bordeaux, France, to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a painter and drawing master, and her mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician. The family struggled financially, and Raymond had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. Rosa's early life was marked by frequent moves and a lack of stability. Despite this, she was exposed to art from a young age and showed a natural talent for drawing and painting.

Rosa's parents encouraged her artistic endeavors, and she spent much of her childhood drawing and painting. She was a tomboy and enjoyed playing with her brothers and engaging in rough-and-tumble activities. When the family moved to Paris in 1829, Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school, where she excelled in art and developed her skills.

As Rosa grew older, her father began to take her more seriously as an artist. He allowed her to work in his studio and encouraged her to develop her skills. Rosa's breakthrough came when she was 11 years old and created a painting of a bunch of cherries. Her father was impressed, and this marked the beginning of her serious artistic training.

Rosa spent many hours studying and practicing, often in the Louvre, where she would copy the works of the masters. She developed a passion for painting animals and spent much of her time studying their anatomy and behavior. She even kept a menagerie in her home, which included a sheep, a goat, and various birds and animals.

In 1841, Rosa submitted two works to the Salon, a prestigious art exhibition in Paris. Both pieces were accepted, and this marked the beginning of her successful career as an artist. Over the next few years, Rosa continued to submit works to the Salon, and her reputation as a talented animal painter grew.

She became one of the most celebrated animal painters of her time, and her work continues to be admired and respected today.

Rosa's relationship with her father was close, and she credited him with helping her to develop her artistic talents. She also had a close relationship with her brothers, Auguste and Isidore, who shared her love of art and music. The Bonheur family was a creative and supportive one, and they encouraged each other to pursue their passions and develop their talents.

In addition to her family, Rosa was also influenced by the artistic community in Paris. She spent many hours studying and learning from the works of the masters, and she was particularly drawn to the works of the animal painters. She also developed a passion for sculpture and made models of animals in clay and wax.

Rosa's decision to become an animal painter was not taken lightly. She was aware of the challenges and difficulties that she would face, but she was driven by her passion for art and her desire to succeed. She spent many years developing her skills and building her reputation, and her hard work and dedication ultimately paid off.
