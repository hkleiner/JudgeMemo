You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jim Felton sat on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated. Despite the beautiful surroundings, he was bitter about his lack of success in finding gold. He had sunk many prospect holes, but found nothing but ashy wash beneath the surface. Jim's thoughts were also consumed by a letter from his sweetheart, Anne, who had rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability.

Anne's letter explained that she couldn't marry Jim without a guarantee of a steady income, and that his carefree nature wouldn't be able to provide for her. Jim understood her concerns, but was hurt and angry by her rejection. He felt like the whole world was against him and that everything was a joke. Jim's emotions were intense, and he was torn between his love for Anne and his frustration with his situation.

As Jim sat on the doorstep, he heard the sound of a horse approaching. It was Bud, the mail carrier, who had come to deliver the mail. Bud noticed that Jim was upset and tried to cheer him up. He offered Jim two dollars and suggested that he go to town and get drunk to forget his troubles. Jim refused, feeling that he couldn't pay Bud back.

Bud insisted that Jim take the money and told him to go to Plattsburg, a town 50 miles away, to catch a train. Jim was tempted, but didn't want to take Bud's horse. Instead, he asked Bud to round up a burro for him to ride. Bud agreed and left to find a burro. When he returned, he told Jim about being held up by a robber on his mail route. The robber, a humpbacked man, had tried to steal the mail but only got away with $10.

Bud was amused by the incident and joked about the robber's misfortune. He then handed Jim the reins of the burro and told him to take care. Jim thanked Bud and set off on his journey, feeling a bit better after their conversation. As they parted ways, Bud knocked Jim's hat over his eyes and told him to have a good time. Jim rode off on the burro, feeling a sense of freedom and uncertainty about what lay ahead. Despite his troubles, Jim was determined to make the most of his situation and find a way to win Anne back.
