You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author wants to discuss the bookman, rather than his books, and define what a bookman is. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature. Having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman, as they may be a book collector or have books solely for show. A true bookman is born, not made, and has a natural affinity for literature.

The author recounts a story of a man who invited him to dinner and showed off his impressive library, but it was clear that the man was not a bookman, despite his extensive collection. The books were locked behind glass doors, and the man seemed more interested in showing off his wealth than in discussing literature. The author notes that a bookman would never lock up his books, but rather keep them accessible and cherished.

In contrast, the author tells the story of a colonial squatter who, after making his fortune, asked a friend to send him a collection of books. The friend spent a month selecting the best of English literature, but the squatter's response was disappointing, as he simply asked if any new works by Shakespeare or Milton had been written. However, the author sees this as a sign that the squatter had a natural instinct for literature, as he had fixed on two of the greatest classics of the English tongue.

The author argues that a bookman is not someone who is educated or trained in literature, but rather someone who has a natural love and appreciation for it. He notes that many people who are considered bookmen may not have read the latest bestsellers, but instead return again and again to classic works of literature. The author also suggests that a bookman is not someone who is swayed by popular opinion or critical reviews, but rather someone who trusts their own judgment and tastes.

The author quotes a French critic, Sainte-Beuve, who defines a classic work of literature as one that has enriched the human mind and spoken to all people in a style that is both new and antique. The author argues that such works are timeless and will continue to be read and cherished for generations to come. In contrast, ordinary books may be popular for a time, but will eventually be forgotten.

The author notes that a bookman is very catholic in their tastes and has no horror of any particular subject or genre. They may enjoy a wide range of literature, from Puritan classics like the Pilgrim's Progress to Roman Catholic works like A'Kempis. The author also notes that a bookman would never be content without a complete collection of the works of great authors like Milton, and would also appreciate scholarly editions and commentaries.

Ultimately, the author suggests that being a bookman is not just about owning or reading books, but about having a deep love and appreciation for literature and a natural instinct for what is truly great and timeless. A bookman is someone who trusts their own judgment and tastes, and is not swayed by popular opinion or critical reviews. They are someone who returns again and again to classic works of literature, and finds joy and inspiration in the written word.
