You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life. He is considered a direct descendant of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a great master of peasant painting. Brueghel's influence was felt in the Low Countries, and his school included artists like Adrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its profundity and sympathetic rendering of everyday peasant life, tinged with melancholy fervor.

Millet's temperament is different from that of the 17th-century Dutch masters, reflecting the more subdued attitude towards life in the 19th century. The French peasant, with the benefits of the Revolution, was a quieter man than his Dutch prototype. Millet's work is marked by incisive truth and absorbing sincerity, similar to the Dutchmen he is compared to.

Millet's study of Italian Renaissance masters, such as Andrea Mantegna, influenced his work. His keen perception and appreciation of Mantegna's merits are evident in his compositions. Millet's pictures are notable for their subtleties of line and tone, which are unparalleled in the works of his contemporaries.

Millet's life was one of struggle, and he grasped the sorrows and troubles of the simple folk around him. He saw that work made life liveable for them, and he shared their struggles. His famous painting, "The Angelus," is a case in point, depicting the end of the day for two peasants, with the ringing of the bell in the distant tower.

The painting is symbolic of French peasant life, with the ploughed field, the poverty of the laborers, and the softening influence of religion. Millet's work is not sentimental, but rather a reflection of the intense earnestness and melancholy truth he infused into his art.

Millet's technique is restrained, and he never bursts into pyrotechnics like some of his contemporaries. His manner of handling the brush is always restrained, but he can achieve great power when needed. His art is characterized by its simplicity, and he is more a philosopher than a painter.

Millet's interest was divided between the peasant at work and his family life. He was impressed by the loneliness of the peasant's labor, as depicted in his painting "The Sheep Pen." The painting shows a shepherd standing alone in a vast plain, accompanied only by his dog, with no other living soul in sight.

Millet's work is a reflection of his understanding of the great problems of life. He was poor all his life, but it is doubtful whether riches would have brought him increased happiness. He loved the open country and the solitary peasant, and his art is a testament to his observation and appreciation of the simplest incidents of everyday life. Overall, Millet's art is a profound and sympathetic rendering of peasant life, marked by its simplicity, restraint, and philosophical depth.
