You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians. According to legend, the city was founded by Nacogdoches, the son of a Caddo chief, who was instructed to travel towards the setting sun and establish a home for his tribe. The Tejas Indians lived in the area, building comfortable homes and ceremonial mounds, and were known for their friendly communication and trade with other tribes.

The first European to visit the area was Hernando De Soto, who spent the winter of 1541-42 in Nacogdoches. Later, in 1620, Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda taught the Tejas tribes the Christian religion. The first definite description of Nacogdoches and its aboriginal population is found in the account of LaSalle's visit in 1685.

In 1691-1692, DeLeon and his followers made the first serious attempts to educate the Tejas Indians in European ways. The first permanent European settlement in Nacogdoches was made in 1716, when Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus founded the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches. The mission had an eventful history, and the town was eventually abandoned as a military post in 1773.

The city of Nacogdoches was refounded in 1779 by Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo and his compatriots. Ybarbo recognized the need for a commissary and erected the Old Stone Fort, which was used for storing military and commercial supplies. The new city grew rapidly, and by the beginning of the 19th century, it had a population of several hundred people.

In 1800, Nacogdoches was a loyal Spanish town, and it played a role in the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition. Nolan had been reared by General James Wilkinson and had invaded Texas with a small band of adventurers. The population of the town supported Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his garrison, who pursued and arrested Nolan's band.

Nolan was killed, and the remainder of the expedition were captured and brought back to Nacogdoches. The Old Stone Fort was used to hold the prisoners, and they were later taken to Mexico. The incident led to the discovery of a plot involving Nolan, Burr, and Wilkinson, and several local leaders were tried for treason.

The purchase of Louisiana by the United States from France in 1803 brought about a great change in the political and military affairs of Nacogdoches. The city's history is marked by its strategic location and its role in the conflicts between European powers. Today, Nacogdoches is a thriving city with a rich cultural heritage.

The city's early history is also marked by the presence of ceremonial mounds, which were built by the Tejas Indians. Unfortunately, many of these mounds were razed, but one remains on Mound Street. The city's archives preserve the history of the area, including the original Book of Ordinances promulgated by Gil Ybarbo in 1780.

Overall, Nacogdoches has a unique and fascinating history that reflects the complex interactions between European powers and Native American tribes. The city's strategic location and rich cultural heritage make it an important part of Texas history. The Old Stone Fort, the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches, and the ceremonial mounds are all testaments to the city's rich and varied past.
