You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier was a French painter born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and realistic artwork, particularly in depicting military scenes. Meissonier's early life was marked by a strong desire to become an artist, despite his father's initial disapproval. His mother, who died when he was young, had a fondness for music and art, which may have influenced his early interest in painting.

Meissonier's father, a dealer in colonial products and chemicals, wanted him to pursue a more practical career. However, the young Meissonier was determined to become an artist and began taking lessons with a local painter, Julien Petier. He later studied with Léon Cogniet, a renowned artist of the time.

Meissonier's early work was not widely recognized, and he struggled to make a living as an artist. He shared a small studio with friends, including the caricaturist Daumier and the landscape painter Daubigny. To make ends meet, Meissonier took on various commissions, including decorating fans and creating religious figures for publishers.

At the age of 16, Meissonier exhibited his work for the first time at the Salon in 1834. Although his painting, "A Visit to the Burgomaster," did not receive much attention from the public, it caught the eye of some editors who recognized his talent. Meissonier's big break came when he met with the art publisher Curmer, who eventually gave him a chance to showcase his work.

Meissonier's perseverance and dedication to his craft ultimately paid off. He became known for his incredible attention to detail and his ability to capture the essence of his subjects. His artwork was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he went on to become one of the most celebrated artists of his time.

Meissonier's approach to art was characterized by his commitment to realism and his desire to accurately depict the world around him. He was known to go to great lengths to ensure the accuracy of his paintings, often spending hours studying his subjects and making meticulous notes. This attention to detail and his passion for art earned him a reputation as one of the greatest painters of his era.

Throughout his career, Meissonier remained true to his artistic vision, never compromising his values or sacrificing his integrity for the sake of fame or fortune. His legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers to this day, and his paintings remain a testament to his boundless talent and dedication to his craft. Meissonier's story is a reminder that success rarely comes easily and that perseverance and hard work are essential for achieving greatness.
