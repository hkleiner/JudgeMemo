You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among great artists. A significant time gap existed between the death of Adrian van Ostade and Millet's birth, with only Chardin filling the gap. Millet's work is characterized by a profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday peasant life, tinged with melancholy fervor. He is considered a direct descendant of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a great master of peasant painting. Brueghel's influence was felt in the Low Countries, leading to a school of brilliant painters, including Adrian Brouwer and Jan Steen.

Millet's temperament is distinct from his predecessors, reflecting the subdued tone of the 19th century. The French peasant, having benefited from the Revolution, was quieter than their Dutch counterparts. Millet's work lacks the brutality found in Dutch paintings, due to his gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters, such as Andrea Mantegna. His noblest inspirations were conceived under Mantegna's influence, with many compositions showing parallel lines of thought.

Millet's pictures from his mature years showcase subtleties of line and tone, distinct from his contemporaries. His development is attributed to the simplicity of his life and the high ideal he kept before him. Living a life of struggle, Millet grasped the sorrows and troubles of the simple folk around him. He saw that work made life liveable for them, and he shared their struggles intensely. Millet's art has been criticized for sentimentality, but this charge is unfounded, as his work conveys a message of intense earnestness and melancholy truth.

The "Angelus" is a notable example of Millet's work, symbolizing the touching aspects of French peasant life. The painting depicts two figures in a serene atmosphere, with the distant tower bell proclaiming the end of the day. The scene showcases the struggle for subsistence and the softening influence of religion in the peasants' lives. Millet's art is not just about technique, but about conveying a message. His manner of handling the brush is restrained, and he rarely bursts into pyrotechnics, instead focusing on suppressed tendencies towards virtuosity.

Millet's dominant characteristic is that he is no longer a great artist when he throws off his philosophic mood. For example, in "La Baigneuse," he attempts to depict the brighter side of life but fails to achieve the same level of greatness. Millet can be described as more a philosopher than a painter, with his drawings and etchings revealing a mind that has grappled with life's great problems. He was poor throughout his life, but his love for the open country and the solitary peasant drove his art. Millet was particularly impressed by the loneliness of the peasant's labor, as seen in "The Sheep Pen," where a shepherd stands alone, accompanied only by his dog, in a vast plain.

Millet's interest was divided between the peasant at work and his family life, and he made the simplest incidents of their everyday life the subject of many fine canvases. His art is a testament to his understanding of the human condition, and his ability to convey the struggles and sorrows of the common people. Overall, Millet's work is a reflection of his unique temperament, his study of the great masters, and his profound understanding of the peasant life. His art continues to be celebrated for its beauty, simplicity, and depth, offering a glimpse into the lives of the people he portrayed with such sensitivity and compassion.
