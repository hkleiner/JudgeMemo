You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Veronese, born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, was a renowned painter known for his unique style and technique. He was described as both absurd and adorable, with a disdain for logic and historic truth, but an incredible talent for capturing life and color in his paintings. Veronese's artistic journey began in his father's sculpture studio, but he soon discovered his passion for painting under the guidance of his uncle, Antonio Badile. He learned to draw by copying the engravings of Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden, which helped him develop his skill and technique.

Veronese's early work already showed signs of his genius, and he quickly gained recognition in Verona. He was commissioned to paint a Madonna for the Church of San Bernardino, which proved to be a success. The cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga then summoned him to decorate the cathedral at Mantua, where he competed with other painters and emerged as the preferred artist. Veronese's painting of the Temptations of St. Anthony impressed the cardinal, and he was hailed as a rising star in the art world.

However, Veronese soon found that Verona was too narrow for his ambitions, and he set out to explore other cities. He collaborated with his friend, Battista Zelotti, on several projects, including the decoration of a palace in Tiene. Their work together was highly successful, and Veronese's style began to take shape. He was particularly drawn to the city of Venice, which he saw as the Promised Land of art and glory.

When Veronese arrived in Venice, he was not yet 25 years old, but he was already making a name for himself. The city's opulence and beauty dazzled him, and he was inspired by the works of other great Venetian painters, including Giorgione, Carpaccio, and Titian. Despite the danger of imitating others, Veronese managed to remain true to his own unique vision and style. His paintings were always an exaltation of the joy of living, filled with vibrant colors, luxurious fabrics, and beautiful scenery.

Veronese's private life remains somewhat of a mystery, with few documents and letters surviving to this day. However, his paintings provide a glimpse into his personality and character, revealing a man with a pleasant humor and a strong sense of dignity. He was known to be quick-tempered and proud, but also a worthy gentleman who valued his honor above all else. Throughout his life, Veronese remained committed to his art, and his legacy continues to inspire and delight art lovers to this day.

Veronese's time in Venice was marked by great creativity and productivity, as he poured his heart and soul into his paintings. He became known as the chosen painter of the Most Serene Republic, and his works adorned the ceilings of palaces and the walls of churches. Veronese's unique style, which blended fantasy and reality, made him a beloved and respected artist in his time. His paintings continue to be celebrated for their beauty, charm, and joy, and he remains one of the most beloved and admired painters in history.
