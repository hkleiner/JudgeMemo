You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change and transformation in England. Each generation tends to reject the values and ideas of the previous one, and this was particularly true during the Victorian era. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, brought about rapid changes in technology, economy, and society. The French Revolution also had a profound impact on England, leading to a period of reaction and counter-reaction.

The pendulum of history swings back and forth, with each movement generating a counter-movement. This can be seen in the rise and fall of empires, the growth and decline of ideas, and the evolution of social and political systems. The Victorian Age was a time of great upheaval, with the old order being challenged and a new social order being built.

Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a relatively stable and prosperous country, with a strong aristocracy and a largely rural population. The aristocracy was highly cultivated and played a significant role in shaping the country's culture and politics. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent wars led to a period of panic and reaction, which delayed the implementation of democratic reforms.

The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in the economy and society, including the growth of cities and the development of new industries. However, it also led to the exploitation of workers, poverty, and social unrest. The condition of the working class during this period was very bad, with many people living in poverty and squalor.

The war with France also had a significant impact on England, leading to a period of isolationism and a decline in international cooperation. The country became more focused on its own internal affairs, and the bonds of sympathy with France were not renewed until later. The war also led to an increase in nationalism and patriotism, which had a profound impact on English society and culture.

Despite the challenges and difficulties of the time, the Victorian Age was also a period of great progress and achievement. The country experienced rapid economic growth, and the standard of living improved significantly. Education and liberty were also increasing, and the country was becoming more prosperous and stable.

The idea of progress was a dominant theme during the Victorian Age, with many people believing that the country was making rapid progress towards a better future. However, this idea was not without its critics, and some people argued that the progress was not as rapid or widespread as it seemed. The economists of the time pointed out that over-population was a major problem, and that it was leading to poverty and social unrest.

Overall, the Victorian Age was a complex and multifaceted period in English history, marked by significant changes and challenges. It was a time of great upheaval and transformation, but also of great progress and achievement. The country was undergoing a significant transition from a rural to an industrial economy, and the social and political systems were being transformed as a result.

The period was also marked by a growing awareness of social and economic issues, including poverty, inequality, and exploitation. The condition of the working class was a major concern, and many people were advocating for reforms and improvements. The idea of progress was a dominant theme, but it was not without its critics, and the period was marked by a significant amount of social and political unrest.

In conclusion, the Victorian Age was a significant period in English history, marked by great change and transformation. It was a time of great progress and achievement, but also of great challenge and difficulty. The country was undergoing a significant transition, and the social and political systems were being transformed as a result. The period was marked by a growing awareness of social and economic issues, and the idea of progress was a dominant theme, but it was not without its critics.
