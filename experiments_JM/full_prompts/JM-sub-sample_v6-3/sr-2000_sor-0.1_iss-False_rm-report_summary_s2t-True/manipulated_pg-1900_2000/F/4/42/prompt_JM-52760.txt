You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting taking place in Virginia between Washington and Richmond. Despite various Union generals attempting to capture Richmond and defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, none had succeeded. The war in the East seemed far from a final settlement, with the Union failing to deliver a decisive blow against the Confederacy. However, in the West, the Union had made significant gains, including the capture of Vicksburg and Chattanooga.

In 1864, the Northern armies were in a stronger position than the Confederate forces, with greater resources and a stronger leader in General Ulysses S. Grant. Grant was appointed lieutenant general and given responsibility for all Union armies. He decided to accompany the Army of the Potomac and provide general direction, while leaving the execution of operations to General George Meade.

The Union plan was a two-pronged attack, with General William Sherman leading the southern prong and Grant leading the northern prong. The goal was to capture Richmond, crush the Army of Northern Virginia, and march south to join Sherman. The Army of the James, led by General Benjamin Butler, was tasked with advancing on Richmond from the southeast and threatening communications between the city and the Southern states.

The Battle of the Wilderness marked the start of the final campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia. The battle resulted in heavy losses on both sides, but the armies remained intact. Grant then moved the Army of the Potomac to the east of Richmond, hoping to outflank the Confederate defenders. However, General Robert E. Lee was able to counter Grant's moves, and the Union army suffered heavy losses at Cold Harbor.

After Cold Harbor, Grant decided to turn south and isolate Richmond by attacking Petersburg and cutting the railroads that supplied the city. Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub, with several roads and railroads converging on the city. The city's capture would almost certainly lead to the abandonment of Richmond. The Confederates had built a defense line around Petersburg, known as the Dimmock Line, which was 10 miles long and protected all but the northern approaches to the city.

The Dimmock Line was constructed in 1862 and 1863, and it had several weaknesses, including a deep ravine between Batteries 7 and 8. The line required a large number of troops to defend it, but General Beauregard did not have enough men to do so. The Union army made several raids on the railroads south and west of Petersburg, but they were unable to permanently shut off the supplies.

On June 14, Grant ordered the attack on Petersburg, and the XVIII Corps of the Army of the James crossed the Appomattox River and approached the city. The Union forces outnumbered the Confederates, with 18,000 soldiers facing less than 4,000 under Beauregard. The stage was set for the Battle of Petersburg, which would be a crucial turning point in the war. The battle would determine the fate of Richmond and the Confederacy, and it would be a long and bloody siege. The Union army's goal was to capture Petersburg and cut off the supplies to Richmond, which would force the Confederates to abandon the city. The battle would be a test of endurance and strategy, with both sides suffering heavy losses.
