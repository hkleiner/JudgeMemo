You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, taking a tram to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs. They want to buy a dog, but not a purebred one, and think they can get one for five shillings at the home. The conductor on the tram teases them about getting off at the "Home for Lost Dawgs." When they arrive, they try to find the home but get lost and decide to follow a man who appears to be an official from the home.

As they follow the man, they try to be discreet, but it's a challenging and humiliating task. The man notices them and starts to hurry, and they find themselves in a frantic chase through the streets. Eventually, the man leads them to a cul-de-sac, where he enters a villa, leaving them confused and dogless.

The narrator and Stella are left standing in the street, feeling foolish and frustrated. They realize that the man might have been going home from the dog's home, not to it. They decide to give up and head back home, taking a taxi to the train station. On the way home, Stella is clearly upset and doesn't want to talk about dogs anymore.

The narrator suggests advertising for a dog, but Stella is uninterested. As they walk home across the golf course, Stella suddenly grabs the narrator's arm and points to something. The story ends with a sense of uncertainty and anticipation, as the narrator wonders what Stella has seen.

The narrator and Stella had previously discussed getting a dog, considering different breeds and prices. They had decided on an Aberdeen terrier but then changed their minds and thought the Home for Lost Dogs would be a better option. The narrator's son, John, had suggested getting twelve tigers in a box, but that idea was quickly dismissed.

Throughout the story, the narrator pokes fun at himself and his wife, highlighting their foolishness and naivety. The story is a lighthearted and humorous tale of a couple's misadventures as they try to find a dog. The narrator's wife, Stella, is portrayed as a strong-willed and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind.

The story also touches on the theme of class and social status, as the narrator and Stella navigate the streets of London and interact with people from different backgrounds. The narrator's discomfort and embarrassment as they follow the man from the dog's home are palpable, and the story highlights the challenges of navigating unfamiliar territories and social situations.

Overall, the story is a charming and entertaining tale of a couple's adventures as they try to find a dog. The narrator's witty commentary and humorous observations make the story a delightful read, and the ending leaves the reader wondering what will happen next.
