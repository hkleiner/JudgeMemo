You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among great artists like Adrian van Ostade and Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Brueghel is considered the fountain-head of peasant painting, and his influence can be seen in later artists like Millet. Millet's work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday peasant life, tinged with melancholy fervor. He is a direct lineal descendant of Brueghel, and his paintings convey a sense of struggle and hardship.

Millet's peasants are depicted with fidelity and vigor, and his work is marked by a sense of simplicity and earnestness. He was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, particularly Andrea Mantegna, and his paintings often feature subtle lines and tones. Millet's life was one of struggle, and he was able to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the simple folk around him. He saw that work was what made life liveable for them, and he shared their struggles.

Some of Millet's most popular works, like "The Angelus," have been criticized for being sentimental. However, this criticism is unfounded, as the painting conveys a sense of intensity and poetical feeling. The two figures in the foreground are symbolical of French peasant life, and the painting depicts the end of the day, with the ringing of the bell and the still atmosphere. The ploughed field and the poverty of the laborers are also symbolic of the struggle for subsistence.

Millet's art is not just about technique, but about conveying a message. He was a philosopher as much as a painter, and his work is characterized by a sense of melancholy truth. His paintings are not just about depicting reality, but about conveying the emotions and struggles of the people he portrayed. Millet's use of atmosphere and line is unique, and his paintings can only be fully appreciated by those who are familiar with the country he painted.

Millet's style is restrained, and he often held himself back from displaying virtuosity. However, when he did, as in "The Sawyers," he achieved great power. His art is not just about beauty, but about conveying a sense of truth and reality. Millet was more a philosopher than a painter, and his work is characterized by a sense of depth and understanding. He was poor all his life, but his interest was in the simple incidents of everyday life, and he made many fine canvases depicting these moments.

Millet was particularly impressed by the loneliness of the peasant's labor, as depicted in "The Sheep Pen." The painting shows a shepherd standing alone in a vast plain, watching his flock enter the pen for the night. The shepherd is dead to the beauties of the landscape, and only sees the practical aspects of his work. Millet's painting conveys a sense of solitude and hardship, and it is a powerful depiction of the peasant's life. Overall, Millet's work is a testament to his ability to convey the struggles and emotions of the people he portrayed, and his paintings continue to be celebrated for their beauty and depth.
