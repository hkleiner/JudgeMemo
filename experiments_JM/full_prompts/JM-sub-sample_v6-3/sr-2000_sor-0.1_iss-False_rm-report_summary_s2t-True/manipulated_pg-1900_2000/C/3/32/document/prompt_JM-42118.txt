You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, a small town in southern France. His father was a glovemaker, and the family lived a simple life. Fragonard grew up surrounded by the beauty of Provence, which would later influence his art. As a child, he was fascinated by the stories of Paris and its artistic scene. In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed, marking the beginning of a new era of peace and cultural growth.

Fragonard's parents wanted him to pursue a career in commerce, but he was drawn to art. At the age of 16, his mother took him to Paris to meet the famous painter François Boucher. Boucher was impressed by Fragonard's talent, but advised him to study with Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin to learn the basics of painting. Fragonard worked with Chardin for a while, but made little progress.

Undeterred, Fragonard continued to practice on his own, copying prints and painting from memory. After six months, he returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a student. Fragonard worked on decorative cartoons and enlargements of Boucher's paintings, which helped him develop his skills. In 1751, the Director-General of Buildings, Lenormant de Tournehem, died, and the Pompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandières, was appointed to the position.

Fragonard's master, Boucher, encouraged him to compete for the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art prize. At the age of 20, Fragonard won the prize with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." He then spent three years studying at the king's school, where he worked under the guidance of Carle Van Loo. During this time, Fragonard continued to work in Boucher's studio and developed his own style, creating paintings like "Blind Man's Buff."

The artistic scene in Paris was thriving, with the Pompadour and her brother, the Marquis de Marigny, playing important roles as patrons of the arts. The Marquis de Marigny was a supporter of Fragonard and helped him advance his career. Meanwhile, the king's relationship with the Parliament was deteriorating, and in 1756, the king was stabbed by a man named Damiens. Despite the turmoil, Fragonard's career was on the rise, and he was well on his way to becoming one of the most celebrated artists of his time.

Fragonard's early life and training had a significant impact on his artistic style, which was characterized by its elegance, charm, and sense of wonder. His experiences in Paris, particularly his time working with Boucher, helped shape his artistic vision and prepare him for a successful career. With the support of his patrons and the encouragement of his master, Fragonard was able to develop his unique style and create some of the most beautiful and enduring works of art of his time.
