You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 1538, a writ of summons was sent to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before King Henry VIII on charges of treason. The shrine of Thomas Becket was destroyed, and his name was erased from records. However, in the 20th century, a new enthusiasm for the site of the shrine emerged, and a considerable literature on the subject has sprung up.

Many modern pilgrims visit Canterbury, but some do not approach the city in the traditional way, instead using the railway. The author suggests that those who use the railway miss out on the first view of the Cathedral city, which is set in the midst of soft-swelling hills. To get the full experience, pilgrims should desert their train at Selling or Chartham and walk the rest of the way over Harbledown.

The city of Canterbury has a long history, dating back to the Roman invasions of Britain. The Romans called the city Durovernum, and it was an important center for trade and commerce. The city was later abandoned and left to ruin, but it was rebuilt by the Saxons, who called it Cantwarabyrig. The Saxons established their capital in Canterbury, and it became an important center for the Christian Church in England.

In 597, Augustine landed on the island of Ebbsfleet and began to preach and instruct the people of Canterbury. The influence of the queen and her chaplain, Bishop Luidhard, had prepared the ground for Augustine's mission, and many converts were made. Ethelbert, the king, was baptized, and the Christianizing of England began. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years.

The city of Canterbury has undergone many changes over the centuries, but it continues to be an important center for the Church of England. The first church mentioned in history associated with Christian worship is St. Martin's, which occupies a unique position. However, the fabric of the building does not conclusively prove that it is the actual church of the period. Some archaeologists believe that the earliest work in St. Martin's belongs to the Saxon period, while others claim that it is a Roman church.

The problem of the origins of St. Martin's may be solved by further discoveries, but for now, it is regarded as a very early Saxon building, possibly standing on the site of a restored Roman church. The city of Canterbury is still an important center for the Church of England, and its rich history and heritage continue to attract pilgrims and visitors from around the world. Despite the many changes that have taken place over the centuries, Canterbury remains a city steeped in history and tradition. The author encourages pilgrims to approach the city in the traditional way, on foot, to get the full experience of the city's beauty and history.
