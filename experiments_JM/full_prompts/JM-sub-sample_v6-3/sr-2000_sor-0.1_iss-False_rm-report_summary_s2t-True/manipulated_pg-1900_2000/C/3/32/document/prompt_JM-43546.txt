You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the little Scotch cousins to their American counterparts. The author notes that despite differences, the Scotch and Americans share a common bond, particularly in their language and cultural heritage. Many Scottish legends and stories have captivated Americans, and the author believes that the little Scotch cousins will receive a warm welcome in America.

The story then shifts to the finding of "Rob Roy," a little puppy discovered by Donald, the son of Doctor Gordon. Donald finds the puppy in a lane leading to the widow Calden's house and decides to take him home. The puppy is a fine collie breed, and Donald is eager to keep him. However, his father suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising him in the paper and giving notice at the police station.

As the family enjoys their afternoon tea, they discuss the puppy's fate. Donald is hopeful that he can keep the puppy, and his father agrees that if no one claims him, they can provide a good home. The family is delighted by the puppy's antics, and Donald starts making plans to train him as a sheep-dog.

The conversation turns to Uncle Alan, who has invited the family to visit him at his home, Skylemore, in the Highlands. Uncle Alan is a wealthy man who made his fortune in copper mines in America and returned to Scotland to enjoy his wealth. Donald is fascinated by his uncle's stories of adventure and the American West.

As the days pass, Donald grows more attached to the puppy, and the family decides to name him Rob Roy, after the hero of Sir Walter Scott's novel. The puppy becomes a beloved member of the Gordon family, and Donald is thrilled to have a new companion. The family is also excited about the upcoming visit from their cousins, Janet and Marjorie Lindsay, and the boys start planning their adventures together.

The story provides a glimpse into Scottish culture and traditions, including their love of sweet treats, such as shortbread and cakes. The author also highlights the strong sense of family and community in Scottish culture, as embodied by Uncle Alan's love for his homeland and his desire to share it with his family.

Overall, the story is a heartwarming tale of family, friendship, and the joys of growing up in Scotland. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the author's descriptions of the Scottish landscape and culture are vivid and engaging. The story sets the stage for further adventures with Donald, his family, and his new puppy, Rob Roy.
