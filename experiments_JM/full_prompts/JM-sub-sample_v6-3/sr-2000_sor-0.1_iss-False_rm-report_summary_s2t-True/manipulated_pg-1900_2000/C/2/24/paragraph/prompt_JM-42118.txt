You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, a small town in southern France. His father, a glovemaker, wanted him to pursue a career in commerce, but Fragonard's passion lay in art. The town of Grasse was far removed from the artistic and cultural hub of Paris, where the latest fashions and trends were born. However, the beauty of the surrounding landscape, with its olive trees, orange groves, and colorful flowers, had a profound impact on Fragonard's young mind.

As Fragonard grew up, he was aware of the gossip and scandals that trickled down from Paris, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, the king's mistress. The Pompadour was a patron of the arts and had gathered around her the most prominent artists and thinkers of the time, including François Boucher. Boucher's art, which emphasized elegance and charm, was to have a significant influence on Fragonard's own style.

At the age of 16, Fragonard's father apprenticed him to a notary, but the young man's heart was not in it. He spent most of his time drawing and painting, and his mother, recognizing his talent, took him to Paris to meet Boucher. Boucher, impressed by Fragonard's sketches, advised him to study with Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, a master of still-life painting.

Fragonard worked with Chardin for a time, but made little progress. He was then sent away and forced to rely on his own resources. He spent his days haunting the churches of Paris, studying the masterpieces on display, and painting them from memory. After six months, he returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a pupil.

Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard learned the art of decorative painting and worked on large cartoons for the Gobelins and Beauvais looms. He also developed his skills as a painter, producing works such as "Blind Man's Buff." In 1751, the Director-General of Buildings, Lenormant de Tournehem, died, and the Pompadour's brother, Abel Poisson de Vandières, was appointed in his place.

Fragonard's career was further boosted when he won the Prix de Rome in 1752 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." He then spent three years studying at the king's school, where he was one of six élèves protégés under Carle Van Loo. During this time, he continued to work in Boucher's studio and produced several notable paintings.

The 1750s were a time of great turmoil in France, with quarrels between priests and parliaments, and the king's popularity waning. In 1756, the king was stabbed by a would-be assassin, Robert-François Damiens. Despite these upheavals, Fragonard's artistic career continued to flourish, and he went on to become one of the most celebrated painters of his time.

Fragonard's early life and training had a profound impact on his artistic style, which was characterized by its elegance, charm, and sense of wonder. His experiences in Paris, where he was exposed to the latest artistic trends and influences, helped shape his unique vision and approach to painting. As he continued to develop his skills and style, Fragonard was poised to make a significant contribution to the world of art.
