You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians. According to legend, the city was founded by twin brothers, Natchitoches and Nacogdoches, who were the sons of a Caddo chief. The brothers were instructed to travel in opposite directions and establish their own tribes, resulting in the founding of the Nacogdoches and Natchitoches tribes. The two tribes were friendly and had a broad highway, known as El Camino Real, which connected them.

The Tejas Indians lived in the area, building homes and ceremonial mounds, and were later influenced by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle. De Soto spent the winter of 1541-42 in Nacogdoches, and LaSalle became ill and recuperated in the city in 1685. The French and Spanish had a significant presence in the area, with the Spanish establishing the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches in 1716.

The mission was founded by Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus and was an important part of the city's early history. The Spanish settlers found several mounds within the city limits, which were relics of the Indian occupation. Unfortunately, most of these mounds were razed, but one remains on Mound Street. The city grew, and by the beginning of the 19th century, it had a population of several hundred people.

In 1764, the French ceded Louisiana to Spain, and the Spanish garrison in Nacogdoches was no longer needed. The city was abandoned as a military post in 1773 but was refounded in 1779 by Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo. Ybarbo recognized the need for a commissary and built the Old Stone Fort, which was used for storing military and commercial supplies. The fort became a place of refuge and safety during times of peril.

Ybarbo ruled the city as a benevolent despot and promulgated the first Book of Ordinances for the city's government in 1780. The city continued to grow, and by the late 18th century, it was the second-largest town in Texas. In 1800, Nacogdoches was a loyal Spanish town and played a role in the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition. Nolan had been reared by General James Wilkinson and had invaded Texas with a small band of adventurers.

The population of the town supported Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his garrison in their pursuit and arrest of Nolan's band. Nolan was killed, and the remainder of the expedition were captured and brought back to Nacogdoches. The city's history is marked by the influence of European explorers, the presence of the Spanish and French, and the role it played in the early history of Texas. The city's rich cultural heritage is still celebrated today, and its historic landmarks, such as the Old Stone Fort, remain an important part of its identity.

The purchase of Louisiana by the United States from the French in 1803 brought about significant changes in the political and military affairs of Nacogdoches. The city's location on the border of the United States and Spanish Texas made it a crucial point of contention between the two countries. The city's history is a testament to the complex and often tumultuous relationship between European powers and the indigenous peoples of the region.

Overall, Nacogdoches has a unique and fascinating history that reflects the complex cultural and political dynamics of the region. From its founding by the Tejas Indians to its role in the early history of Texas, the city has played an important part in shaping the state's identity. The city's historic landmarks, such as the Old Stone Fort, and its cultural heritage continue to be celebrated and preserved today.
