You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on their own journey into the teaching profession, which began as a temporary solution after college. Many of their peers viewed teaching as a "fill-in job" rather than a respectable career. The author shares the story of two young men who entered the teaching profession under similar circumstances. One man, who became a school superintendent, took a lackluster approach to his job, while the other man, who also became a superintendent, was dedicated and enthusiastic about his work.

The author notes that the second young man had made teaching a profession, while the first had made it just a job. The author then shifts to discussing the process of getting a teaching position, emphasizing the importance of considering one's strengths and weaknesses. Many young teachers enter the field without giving due consideration to the type of work they are best suited for, leading to a high failure rate.

Boards of education typically evaluate applicants based on personality, preparation, and experience. A pleasing and forceful personality is crucial for a teacher's success, and the author shares a personal anecdote about how a principal's attractive personality influenced their decision to complete high school. The author also stresses the importance of making a good personal impression, including dressing appropriately for interviews.

The time for mediocre preparation in the field of education is coming to an end, and teachers must secure a good general education before specializing in a particular subject. The author notes that many teachers who specialize in one subject often have weaknesses in other areas, such as English. It is essential for teachers to continue broadening their general education and to be honest and careful when filling out application blanks.

The author advises applicants to choose responsible references and to secure their permission before using their names. Superintendents are more likely to understand a teacher's motives for applying elsewhere if they have been interviewed. The author contrasts the approach of two young teachers, one who was primarily motivated by salary and another who was driven by a desire to specialize and improve professionally.

Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of dedication, hard work, and a commitment to ongoing education and professional development in the teaching profession. By sharing personal anecdotes and offering practical advice, the author provides valuable insights for those entering the teaching profession. The author's experiences and observations highlight the need for teachers to be thoughtful and intentional in their approach to their work.
