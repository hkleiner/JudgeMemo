You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, taking a tram to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs. They want to buy a dog, but not a pedigree one, and Stella suggests they go to the home to find one for five shillings. The conductor on the tram teases them about getting off at the "Home for Lost Dawgs." When they arrive, they try to find the home but get lost and decide to follow a man who appears to be an official from the home.

As they follow the man, they engage in a series of awkward and humorous encounters, including being misled by a street boy and trying to surreptitiously track the man through the streets. The man eventually leads them on a wild goose chase, and they end up in a cul-de-sac, where he escapes into a villa. The narrator and Stella are left feeling foolish and frustrated.

After their failed attempt to find the dog home, they return to their country station by train and walk home across the golf course. Stella is still upset and doesn't want to talk about dogs anymore. The narrator suggests advertising for a dog, but Stella is uninterested. As they walk, Stella suddenly grabs the narrator's arm and points to something, but it's not clear what she's looking at.

The narrator and Stella had previously discussed buying a dog and had considered different breeds, including bloodhounds, Pekinese, and Old English sheepdogs. They had also consulted with their son, John, who wanted twelve tigers in a box. The narrator's wife, Stella, had suggested going to the Home for Lost Dogs after they received a letter from a breeder in Aberdeen who was selling Aberdeen terriers.

The narrator and Stella had decided not to buy a pedigree dog and instead wanted to find a dog that would be gentle with their baby and bark at beggars. They thought the Home for Lost Dogs would be a good place to find such a dog. However, their attempt to find the home was unsuccessful, and they ended up having a frustrating and embarrassing experience.

The narrator reflects on the events of the day and realizes that they should have just asked the man for directions instead of trying to follow him. He also thinks that it might have occurred to him that the man was going from the dog home, not to it. The narrator apologizes to Stella for the failed attempt and suggests that they try a different approach to finding a dog.

Overall, the story is a lighthearted and humorous account of the narrator and Stella's misadventures as they try to find a dog. The story pokes fun at the challenges of navigating the city and the people in it, as well as the absurdity of the situations that the narrator and Stella find themselves in. The narrator's witty observations and commentary add to the humor and charm of the story.
