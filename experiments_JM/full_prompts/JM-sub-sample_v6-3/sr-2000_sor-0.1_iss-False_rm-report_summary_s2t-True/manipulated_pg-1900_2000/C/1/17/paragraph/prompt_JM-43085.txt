You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The document is about the life and work of French painter Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier. Meissonier was born in 1815 in Lyons, France, to a family of modest means. His father was a dealer in colonial products and chemicals, and his mother was a fragile woman who died when Meissonier was young. Meissonier's early life was marked by a strong interest in art, which was encouraged by his mother's own artistic talents.

As a child, Meissonier would often draw sketches in his copybooks instead of paying attention to his teachers. This tendency caused anxiety for his father, who wanted him to pursue a more traditional career. Despite this, Meissonier's talent for drawing was recognized by his teachers, and he was eventually allowed to pursue his passion for art.

Meissonier's artistic career began when he was 16 years old, and he exhibited his first painting, "A Visit to the Burgomaster," in the Salon catalogue of 1834. However, the public failed to distinguish his work, and it was only later that he gained recognition as a talented artist.

Meissonier's style was characterized by his attention to detail and his commitment to realism. He was known for his meticulous approach to painting, and his works often featured military scenes and figures. Meissonier's approach to art was influenced by his desire to interpret nature precisely as it was, and he believed that an artist should never compromise on reality.

His commitment to realism and his attention to detail earned him a reputation as one of the leading artists of his time. Meissonier's story is a testament to the power of dedication and hard work, and his legacy continues to inspire artists to this day.

He believed that an artist should never compromise on reality, and that the pursuit of artistic excellence required a commitment to truth and accuracy. This approach to art is reflected in his paintings, which are characterized by their attention to detail and their realistic depiction of military scenes and figures.

The document also provides insight into Meissonier's personal life, including his relationships with his family and friends.
