You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The document "Beautiful Britain" discusses the history of Canterbury, a city in England. In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ of summons to Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had been dead for 368 years. The writ accused Becket of treason and ordered his bones to be burnt and his shrine forfeited to the Crown. However, the remains were not burned, and instead, all statues, paintings, and windows depicting Becket were destroyed, and his name was erased from records.

The year 1538 marked the last pilgrimage to Becket's shrine. The document also mentions the artist Boucher, who learned from his master Lemoyne and quickly developed his own style. Boucher's art was influenced by Correggio and Veronese, and he was able to free himself from the traditional Italian style.

The document also talks about the pilgrims who visit Canterbury, comparing them to those in Chaucer's time. While some modern pilgrims may not approach the city with the same devotion as their medieval counterparts, they are still drawn to the city's beauty and history.

The story of Canterbury begins with the Roman invasion of Britain, and the city's importance as a center of trade and commerce. The Romans called the city Durovernum, and it was an important stop on the Roman road network. The city's location made it a key point for travelers and traders.

After the Roman occupation, the city was inhabited by Saxons, who were initially heathen. However, with the arrival of Augustine in 597, the city began to convert to Christianity. Augustine and his monks preached and instructed the Saxons, and soon the city became a major center of Christianity in England.

The city's Christian heritage has continued to the present day, with Canterbury remaining the headquarters of the Church of England. Despite changes in the church and the country, Canterbury remains an important symbol of England's Christian history.

The document also mentions the church of St. Martin, which is believed to be one of the oldest churches in England. While its exact age is uncertain, it is thought to date back to the Roman or Saxon period. The church's history and architecture make it a unique and fascinating part of Canterbury's heritage.

Overall, the document provides a brief history of Canterbury, from its Roman roots to its current status as a major center of Christianity in England. The city's rich history and beautiful architecture make it a popular destination for pilgrims and tourists alike. The document highlights the city's importance as a symbol of England's Christian heritage and its continued relevance in modern times.
