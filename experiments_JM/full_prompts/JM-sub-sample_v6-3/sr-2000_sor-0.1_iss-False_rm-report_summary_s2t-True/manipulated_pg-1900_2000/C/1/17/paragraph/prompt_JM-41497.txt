You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The chapter discusses the life and work of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a prominent English painter of the 18th century. Reynolds was born in 1723 in Devonshire and was apprenticed to Thomas Hudson, a portrait painter. He later traveled to Italy, where he studied and copied the works of famous artists, including Michelangelo and Titian. This experience had a profound impact on his technique and style.

Reynolds' time in Italy was invaluable, and he became one of the greatest copyists of his time. He was particularly influenced by the Venetian school, and his work shows a deep understanding of color and composition. Upon his return to England, Reynolds established himself as a portrait painter and quickly gained success.

He was a skilled artist who could take the best from other artists and incorporate it into his own work. Reynolds was also a man of the world, with a wide range of interests and friendships. He was friends with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke, and his conversations with them must have been inspiring.

Despite his many talents, Reynolds was not without his flaws. He had a touch of snobbery and was jealous of other artists' success. He was also known to be vulgar and flashy, as evidenced by his gilded coach and liveries. However, he was able to overcome many of these weaknesses through his associations with refined and distinguished people.

Reynolds' discourses to the Royal Academy, where he was president, show a deep understanding of art and technique. He believed that students should master the rules of art before disregarding them, and his own practice did not always bear out his teachings. Reynolds was a complex figure, and his life and work continue to be fascinating to this day.

The 18th century was a time of great change, with the Industrial Revolution transforming the way people lived and worked. Reynolds' art reflects this change, and his portraits of prominent figures of the time are still highly regarded today. He was a true master of his craft, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers alike.

Reynolds' success was not limited to his art; he was also a shrewd businessman and was able to charge high prices for his portraits. He lived a long and fulfilling life, and his work remains some of the most iconic and enduring of the 18th century. Despite his flaws, Reynolds was a remarkable figure, and his contributions to the world of art are still celebrated today.

The chapter concludes by noting that Reynolds' life and work are a testament to the power of art to transcend time and circumstance. His portraits continue to captivate audiences, and his influence can still be seen in the work of artists today. Reynolds' legacy is a reminder that true greatness is not just about technical skill, but about the ability to capture the essence of the human experience.
