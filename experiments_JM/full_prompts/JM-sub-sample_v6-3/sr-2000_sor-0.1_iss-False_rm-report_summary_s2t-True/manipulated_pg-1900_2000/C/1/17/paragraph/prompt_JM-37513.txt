You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author recounts their introduction to Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science, which began with reading Tyndall's Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination. This sparked their enthusiasm for the conquest of nature by physical science and the theory of evolution. The author was particularly drawn to Spencer's idea that the human mind and its phenomena were once latent in a fiery cloud. 

Spencer's philosophy emphasized the concept of differentiation, which is the cardinal law of evolution. The author notes that this law implies a universal cause, similar to how gravitation is a cause of various phenomena. Spencer's principle states that every active force produces more than one change, and every cause produces more than one effect. 

The author discusses how Spencer's philosophy encompasses not only biology but also psychology, sociology, and ethics. Spencer's interpretation is all-inclusive, considering these fields as incidents of the great mechanical drama of evolution. The aim of philosophy, according to Spencer, is to interpret all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force. 

The author highlights Spencer's signal merit in working biological interpretation for all, which led him to find clues to social and political developments. However, Spencer was saddened to see that many of his social and political doctrines were not accepted by a newer generation of thinkers. 

Despite this, Spencer's philosophy had a significant impact, widening the scope of scientific explanation and proclaiming the gradual growth of all things by natural processes. His philosophy emphasizes the universality of law and universal causation, which is embodied in his sweeping formula in First Principles. 

The author notes that Spencer's creed deals with ubiquitous causes, the instability of the homogeneous, and the persistence of force. While Spencer's interpretation may seem to focus on the mechanical foundations of evolution, it is actually all-inclusive, considering the organic and superorganic aspects of evolution. 

Ultimately, the author concludes that Spencer's philosophy is an attempt to provide a unified knowledge, interpreting all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, the author also acknowledges that the affairs of the mind present a difficulty, and the antithesis of subject and object is never to be transcended. 

The author quotes Spencer, saying that we can think of matter only in terms of mind, and we can think of mind only in terms of matter. This highlights the complex relationship between the two and the limitations of human understanding. 

In the end, the author suggests that we are baffled by mystery, but we can still rejoice in the attempt to understand the world through Spencer's philosophy. The author's summary provides an overview of Spencer's philosophy, highlighting its key concepts, principles, and implications. 

Spencer's philosophy is a comprehensive system that attempts to explain all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force. His ideas have had a significant impact on the development of modern thought, and his emphasis on the universality of law and universal causation remains an important aspect of his philosophy. 

The author's introduction to Spencer's philosophy had a profound impact on their own thinking, leading them to explore the concept of differentiation and its implications for understanding the world. The author's summary demonstrates the significance of Spencer's philosophy and its continued relevance in modern times. 

Overall, the author provides a clear and concise summary of Spencer's philosophy, highlighting its key concepts and principles. The summary demonstrates the author's understanding of Spencer's ideas and their significance in the context of modern thought. 

The author's discussion of Spencer's philosophy is informative and engaging, providing an overview of the key concepts and principles that underlie his system. The summary is well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers who may not be familiar with Spencer's philosophy. 

In conclusion, the author's summary provides a comprehensive overview of Spencer's philosophy, highlighting its key concepts, principles, and implications. The summary demonstrates the significance of Spencer's philosophy and its continued relevance in modern times, making it a valuable resource for readers interested in exploring his ideas.
