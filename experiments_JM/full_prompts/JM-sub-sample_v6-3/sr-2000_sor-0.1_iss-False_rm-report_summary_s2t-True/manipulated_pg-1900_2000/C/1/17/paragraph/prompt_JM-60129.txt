You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a temple and over the ruins of a wall that once enclosed the oasis. They then entered a sandy and sterile stretch of ground, with Chinese tombstones and low hills in the distance. The only vegetation was insignificant creeping brush, and the team saw no signs of life until they reached a village called Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people.

The Sarö Yögur women wore a strange costume, with a Roman nose and dignified appearance, and they proudly declared their name. However, when a camera was brought out, the atmosphere changed, and the team continued on to the village temple. The temple was small and poor, with three large paintings and old Buddha pictures. The team met the lamas, who were initially cool but later became hospitable and talkative.

The Sarö Yögur people have a legend that their forefathers came from the west over a thousand years ago, and they call themselves "yellow Yögurs" to distinguish themselves from the Tangutans, who are called "black barbarians". The local administration is in the hands of a pykh and his assistant yarkatshe, and the villages pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government.

The team observed the daily life of the Sarö Yögur people, including their clothing, which is made of home-spun material and cut in Chinese fashion. The men wear a Chinese cap or a Mongolian felt cap, and the women's head dresses are decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The team also saw the traditional Chinese sleeping stove, k'ang, and the Buddhist altar in the homes.

The Sarö Yögur people have a simple way of life, with no holiday attire or change of everyday clothes. They only buy new clothes when the old ones are falling apart, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items during the cold season. The men are often at home, while the women are busy outdoors, looking after cattle and carrying water. The only handicrafts or home-industries are weaving, basket-making, and knitting stockings.

The team noted that the Sarö Yögur language has a great resemblance to Khirgis and Turkish, but they were unable to gather any old songs or legends. The people told them that there were none, but it's possible that their suspicious nature or the interpreter's incompetence may have been the reason. The team also observed the temple, which was small and poor, with old paintings and Buddha pictures.

The Sarö Yögur people live in villages, including Machuangtzu, Tungheitzu, and Yumashan, which are spread over a wide area. They pay a yearly tax to the Chinese government and have a simple way of life. The team's observations provide a glimpse into the daily life and culture of the Sarö Yögur people, who are a unique and fascinating group. The expedition's findings are significant, as they provide insight into a previously unknown culture. Overall, the team's experience with the Sarö Yögur people was enlightening, and their observations have contributed to a greater understanding of this fascinating group.
