You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author embarked on an expedition to study the Sarö Yögurs, a Turkish tribe living in the Gobi Desert. They started their journey from the Chinese town of Chin-t'a and traveled southeast, passing through a temple and a wall that formerly enclosed the oasis. The author met three women from the Sarö Yögur tribe, who wore a unique costume and were proud to identify themselves as Sarö Yögurs.

The author visited the village of Machuangtzu, where they met the lamas and were welcomed into their homes. The lamas were surprised by the author's intrusion, but eventually, they became hospitable and talkative. The author learned about the tribe's customs, including their marriage and death rituals. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, and their main source of livelihood is grazing cattle.

The author also visited the Shera Yögurs, another Turkish tribe living in the mountains. They traveled to the village of Kanchenp'u and then to the monastery of K'anglungssu, where they met the t'umu, the hereditary governor of the Shera Yögurs. The author learned about the tribe's history, customs, and way of life. The Shera Yögurs are also a pastoral people, and they live in tents made of coarse canvas-like material.

The author observed that the Shera Yögurs are of medium height, with well-formed hands and feet, and narrow wrists and ankles. They have a unique costume, which includes a sheepskin coat and a hat made of stiff canvas. The author also learned about the tribe's social structure, including their system of relationship between different "bones" or clans.

The Shera Yögurs have a rich cultural heritage, including their music and dance. The author attended a feast, where they sang beautiful melodies and offered cups of hot brandy to the guests. The author also learned about the tribe's struggles, including their loss of cattle during the Dungan revolt and their current economic difficulties.

The author spent several days with the Shera Yögurs, learning about their way of life and customs. They observed that the tribe is quick at their work, talkative, and amusing, and that they have a strong sense of community. The author also noted that the tribe has a unique system of governance, with the t'umu serving as the head of the tribe.

The author's journey with the Shera Yögurs came to an end, and they bid farewell to their hosts. They traveled back to the town of Li-yen, where they were welcomed by the friendly old mandarin. The author reflected on their experience with the Shera Yögurs, noting that they had learned much about the tribe's culture and way of life.

The author's expedition provided valuable insights into the lives of the Sarö and Shera Yögurs, two Turkish tribes living in the Gobi Desert and the mountains. The author's observations and notes provide a unique glimpse into the culture, customs, and way of life of these tribes. The author's experience with the Shera Yögurs was particularly memorable, and they were impressed by the tribe's hospitality and generosity.

The author's journey also highlighted the challenges faced by the Shera Yögurs, including their economic difficulties and their struggles to maintain their cultural heritage. The author noted that the tribe's population is declining, and that they are at risk of losing their unique culture and way of life. The author's expedition served as a reminder of the importance of preserving cultural heritage and supporting minority communities.

Overall, the author's expedition was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into the lives of two unique Turkish tribes. The author's observations and notes will serve as a valuable resource for future researchers and scholars, and will help to promote a greater understanding of the culture and customs of the Sarö and Shera Yögurs.
