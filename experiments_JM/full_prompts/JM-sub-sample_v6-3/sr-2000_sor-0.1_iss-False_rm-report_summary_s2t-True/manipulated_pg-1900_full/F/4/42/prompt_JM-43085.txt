You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier was a French painter known for his meticulous and realistic style. He was born in 1815 in Lyons, France, and his early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion. Meissonier's father, a dealer in colonial products, wanted him to follow in his footsteps, but the young artist was determined to become a painter. He began his training in the studio of Julien Petier and later worked with Léon Cogniet.

Meissonier's early work was influenced by the Romantic movement, but he soon developed his own unique style, characterized by attention to detail and a focus on everyday life. He became known for his small, intricately painted scenes of military life, as well as his portraits of ordinary people. Meissonier's paintings were highly prized by collectors and critics, and he became one of the most celebrated artists of his time.

Despite his success, Meissonier remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He was a perfectionist who spent hours researching and preparing for each painting. He was particularly fascinated by the Napoleonic era and owned a large collection of artifacts and costumes from that time. Meissonier's love of detail and historical accuracy earned him the respect of his peers and the admiration of his patrons.

Meissonier's military paintings are considered some of his best work. He was known for his ability to capture the spirit of the soldiers and the drama of the battlefield. His paintings of Napoleon's army are particularly notable, and he was praised for his attention to detail and his ability to convey the emotions of the soldiers.

In addition to his paintings, Meissonier was also a skilled etcher and illustrator. He illustrated several books, including "The Indian Cabin" and "Paul and Virginia." His etchings are highly prized by collectors and are considered some of the finest examples of his work.

Meissonier's personal life was marked by a deep love of art and a commitment to his craft. He was a hard worker who spent long hours in his studio, perfecting his technique and researching his subjects. He was also a devoted husband and father, and his family was very important to him.

Throughout his career, Meissonier was recognized for his contributions to the art world. He was awarded numerous honors and prizes, including the Grand Golden Medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1855. He was also made a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in 1861 and was appointed president of the Exposition Universelle des Beaux-Arts in 1889.

Despite his many accomplishments, Meissonier remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He continued to paint and etch until his death in 1891, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful and meticulously crafted works of art. Meissonier's attention to detail, his love of historical accuracy, and his commitment to his craft have made him one of the most celebrated artists of his time. His paintings and etchings continue to be admired and studied by art lovers around the world.
