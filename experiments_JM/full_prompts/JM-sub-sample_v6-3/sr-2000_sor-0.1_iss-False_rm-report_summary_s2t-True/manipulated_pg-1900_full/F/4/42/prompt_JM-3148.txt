You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with a quote from Emerson's "April" and introduces Anthony Croft, a blind violin maker, and his nephew Davy. Anthony is reading a story about Paganini to Davy, who is fascinated by the musician's skills. The narrative then shifts to Anthony's past, where he is portrayed as a curious and inventive child who hated school but loved music and nature.

As a child, Anthony would often sneak out of the classroom to play with a tuning fork or create makeshift instruments. He became skilled in repairing and making violins, and people would bring him their instruments to fix. Anthony's mother was worried about his future, but he was determined to pursue his passion for music.

The story then introduces Lyddy Ann Butterfield, a disfigured and reclusive woman who has inherited a house and a small income from her aunt. Lyddy is a kind and gentle soul who is loved by the children she has cared for in the past. She is also a talented homemaker and has a passion for color and beauty.

One day, Lyddy meets Anthony while he is struggling to care for his sick nephew. She offers to help and takes charge of the household, nursing Davy back to health. As they spend more time together, Anthony and Lyddy develop a deep bond, and he begins to see her as a kind and beautiful person, despite her physical appearance.

The narrative explores the theme of perception and how people can be misled by appearances. Anthony, who is blind, is able to see Lyddy's inner beauty and kindness, while others are put off by her disfigurement. The story also touches on the idea of music as a universal language that can bring people together and transcend physical limitations.

As the story progresses, Anthony and Lyddy's relationship deepens, and they begin to share their thoughts and feelings with each other. They discuss books, music, and life, and Lyddy finds herself opening up to Anthony in ways she never thought possible. The narrative also introduces Aunt Hitty, a nosy and opinionated neighbor who is fascinated by Lyddy's life and speculates about her relationship with Anthony.

The story takes a romantic turn as Anthony and Lyddy realize their feelings for each other. Anthony proposes to Lyddy, and she accepts, despite her initial reservations about being a burden to him due to his blindness. The narrative concludes with a scene of domestic bliss, where Anthony and Lyddy are sitting in their apple orchard, surrounded by nature and music.

Anthony is working on a new composition, using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs to create music. Lyddy is sewing a basket, symbolizing their hopes and dreams for the future. The story ends with a sense of joy, love, and new beginnings, as Anthony and Lyddy embark on their life together, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the power of music.
