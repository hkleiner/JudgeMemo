You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator, a literary critic, recalls his encounter with George Corvick, who had been tasked with reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel. Corvick was breathless and worried, having received a telegram from Gwendolen Erme, and asked the narrator to prepare an article for "The Middle" in his place. The narrator was excited to read Vereker's novel and meet him at Lady Jane's house, where he was invited for the weekend.

At Lady Jane's, the narrator met Vereker and was impressed by his affability, but also felt that he was being cruelly conceited. Vereker mentioned that nobody understood his work, and the narrator felt that he was being challenged to discover the hidden meaning. The narrator spent the night reading Vereker's book, but couldn't find the intended meaning.

The next day, Vereker revealed to the narrator that he had a "little point" in his work, a secret that he had never explicitly stated. He encouraged the narrator to find it, but warned that it was difficult to discover. The narrator was fascinated and determined to uncover the secret.

Corvick, who had been searching for the secret, eventually found it, but died in an accident before he could reveal it. His wife, Gwendolen, was left with the knowledge, but refused to share it with the narrator. The narrator was obsessed with finding out the secret and tried to persuade Gwendolen to reveal it, but she refused.

Years later, the narrator met Drayton Deane, Gwendolen's second husband, and asked him if he knew the secret. Deane claimed that he didn't know anything about it, and the narrator realized that Gwendolen had not shared the secret with him. The narrator was shocked and disappointed, feeling that he had been misled.

The narrator reflected on the experience and realized that he had been deluded in thinking that Deane knew the secret. He also understood that Gwendolen had not shared the secret with Deane because she didn't think him worthy. The narrator and Deane commiserated about their shared obsession with uncovering the secret, and the narrator felt a sense of consolation in knowing that Deane was also a victim of unappeased desire.

The narrator's obsession with the secret had become an all-consuming force in his life, and he was willing to do anything to uncover it. He had spent years searching for the answer, but it remained elusive. The experience had left him feeling frustrated and disappointed, but also curious and determined.

In the end, the narrator was left with the realization that the secret remained a mystery, and that he would never know the truth. He was forced to accept that some secrets are meant to remain unspoken, and that the search for knowledge can be a lifelong and ultimately futile pursuit. The narrator's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and the importance of accepting the unknown.
