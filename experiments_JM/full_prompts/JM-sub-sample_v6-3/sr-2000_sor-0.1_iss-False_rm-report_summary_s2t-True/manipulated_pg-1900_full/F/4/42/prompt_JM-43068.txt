You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean François Millet was a prominent painter of peasant life, known for his profound and sympathetic renderings of everyday life. He was born on October 4, 1814, in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, to a peasant family. Millet's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was encouraged by his family to pursue his artistic talents. He began drawing at a young age and was eventually sent to Paris to study art.

Millet's time in Paris was marked by poverty and struggle, but he persevered and eventually found success with his paintings of peasant life. He was influenced by the works of Andrea Mantegna and Michelangelo, and his own style was characterized by simplicity, sincerity, and a deep understanding of the human condition. Millet's paintings often featured peasants engaged in everyday activities, such as farming and domestic work.

In 1849, Millet moved to Barbizon, a small village on the outskirts of Paris, where he became friends with other artists, including Théodore Rousseau. The two artists shared a love of nature and a commitment to depicting the beauty and simplicity of rural life. Millet's paintings from this period, such as "The Sower" and "The Gleaners," are considered some of his finest works.

Despite his success, Millet continued to face financial difficulties throughout his life. He was often forced to sell his paintings for low prices, and he struggled to make ends meet. However, he remained committed to his art and continued to paint until his death on January 20, 1875.

Millet's legacy is that of a poet, philosopher, and great thinker who used his art to express the deepest and most profound aspects of human experience. His influence can be seen in the works of many other artists, including Giovanni Segantini, who was inspired by Millet's example. Today, Millet is recognized as one of the greatest painters of the 19th century, and his works continue to be celebrated for their beauty, simplicity, and profound insight into the human condition.

Millet's art is characterized by its emphasis on the everyday lives of peasants and the natural world. He saw the beauty in the mundane and the ordinary, and he was able to convey this beauty through his paintings. His use of color, composition, and light created a sense of simplicity and sincerity that drew the viewer into the world of his paintings.

The "Angelus" is one of Millet's most famous paintings, and it is a powerful example of his ability to convey the deepest and most profound aspects of human experience. The painting features two peasants praying in a field, and it is a beautiful and moving depiction of the simple, everyday moments that make up human life.

Millet's life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he remained committed to his art and continued to paint until his death. His legacy is a testament to the power of art to express the deepest and most profound aspects of human experience, and his paintings continue to be celebrated for their beauty, simplicity, and profound insight into the human condition.
