You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "Chosen Peoples" explores the concept of a chosen people, particularly in the context of Judaism. The foreword, written by Herbert Samuel, introduces the series of lectures in memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar of Hebrew language and literature. Davis was a self-taught expert who wrote a classical authority on Hebrew accents and worked on a new edition of the Festival Prayer Book.

The first chapter discusses the claim that Jews are a chosen people, which has been a source of irritation for non-Jews. The author argues that this concept is often misunderstood and that the Jewish Bible is not a uniform book, but rather a collection of national literature. The chapter also explores the idea that the God of the Old Testament is not a tribal God, but rather a God of reason and love.

The second chapter delves into the concept of a chosen people, arguing that it is not a sign of arrogance, but rather a sense of responsibility. The author cites examples from Jewish literature, including the Talmud and the writings of Maimonides, to illustrate this point. The chapter also discusses the idea that the Jewish people have a mission to serve the world, and that this mission is not limited to their own people.

The third chapter explores the idea that the Jewish people have a unique role in the world, but that this role is not one of superiority. The author argues that the concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism, and that other nations have also claimed a special mission. The chapter also discusses the idea that the Jewish people have a responsibility to promote justice and righteousness in the world.

The fourth chapter discusses the idea that the Jewish people have a special relationship with God, but that this relationship is not one of exclusivity. The author argues that the Jewish Bible is not a book of tribalism, but rather a book of universalism. The chapter also explores the idea that the Jewish people have a mission to serve as a light to the nations.

The fifth chapter explores the concept of a chosen people in the context of other nations, including England and Germany. The author argues that the idea of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism, and that other nations have also claimed a special mission. The chapter also discusses the idea that the concept of a chosen people can be used to justify aggression and militarism.

The sixth chapter discusses the differences between Judaism and Germanism, arguing that the two are not similar. The author cites examples from Jewish literature and history to illustrate the differences between the two. The chapter also explores the idea that the Jewish people have a responsibility to promote justice and righteousness in the world.

The seventh chapter discusses the idea that the Jewish people have a unique role in the world, but that this role is not one of superiority. The author argues that the concept of a chosen people is not unique to Judaism, and that other nations have also claimed a special mission. The chapter also explores the idea that the Jewish people have a responsibility to promote justice and righteousness in the world.

The eighth chapter concludes the book by discussing the idea that the Jewish people have a mission to serve the world. The author argues that this mission is not limited to their own people, but rather is a universal mission to promote justice and righteousness. The chapter also explores the idea that the Jewish people have a responsibility to work towards a new world order, one that is based on justice and peace.

The afterword, written by Israel Abrahams, pays tribute to Arthur Davis, the scholar in whose memory the lectures were given. Abrahams describes Davis as a self-taught expert who loved the liturgy and was a wonderful teacher. The afterword concludes by quoting a sentence from Jeremiah, which applies to Davis's own life and legacy.
