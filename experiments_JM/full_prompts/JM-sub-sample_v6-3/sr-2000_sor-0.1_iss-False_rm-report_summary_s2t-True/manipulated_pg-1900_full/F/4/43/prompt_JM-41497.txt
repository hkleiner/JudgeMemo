You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned English painter born in 1723. He was destined for success, with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense. Reynolds' early life was uneventful, but his journey to Italy in 1749-1752 was invaluable, where he studied and copied the works of great masters like Michelangelo, Titian, and Rembrandt. He became one of the greatest copyists of his time and was influenced by the Venetian masters.

Upon his return to England, Reynolds established himself as a prominent portrait painter, and his success was rapid. He was elected as the first President of the Royal Academy in 1768 and received a knighthood in 1769. Reynolds' portraits are characterized by their simplicity, directness, and expression of character. He was particularly skilled at capturing the essence of great men, and his portraits of Charles James Fox, David Garrick, and Laurence Sterne are masterful.

Reynolds was a great assimilator, taking inspiration from various artists, but he also had a critical gift that allowed him to appreciate the beauties of a masterpiece while recognizing its defects. He sought to unite the excellences of different masters, leaving out their defects. Reynolds' art moved steadily forward, and his last works were considered his best.

Despite his success, Reynolds faced challenges, including his struggles with permanent coloring and the fading of his glazes. He also had to deal with criticism and controversy, particularly regarding his relationship with Angelica Kaufmann, a female artist. However, Reynolds remained focused on his art, and his legacy as one of the greatest British portrait painters has endured.

Reynolds' personal life was marked by his reserve and courtly demeanor, particularly around women. He was a hardened old bachelor with an eye for beauty, but his interest in women and children was largely limited to their aesthetic appeal. In contrast, he was deeply interested in men and their characters, which is reflected in his portraits.

The Royal Academy, which Reynolds helped establish, played a significant role in promoting British art. Reynolds' discourses, which he delivered as President, are still studied today, and his ideas about art and beauty continue to influence artists. Despite the passage of time, Reynolds' work remains a testament to his skill and artistry, and his legacy continues to be celebrated.

Reynolds' later years were marked by a decline in his health, and he eventually lost his sight. He died in 1792 at the age of 69, leaving behind a remarkable body of work. His funeral was attended by many prominent figures, and he was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. Today, Reynolds' portraits are considered some of the greatest works of British art, and his influence can still be seen in the work of artists around the world.

Overall, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a remarkable artist who left an indelible mark on British art. His legacy continues to inspire and influence artists, and his portraits remain a testament to his skill and artistry. Despite the challenges he faced, Reynolds remained focused on his art, and his dedication to his craft has ensured his place in the annals of art history.
