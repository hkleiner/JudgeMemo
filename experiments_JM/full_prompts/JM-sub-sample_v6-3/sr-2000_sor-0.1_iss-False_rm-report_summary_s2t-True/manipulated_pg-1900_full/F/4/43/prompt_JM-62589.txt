You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl living in Plymouth with her father, Bill Mason. Her father is a drunkard and is forced to leave town, and Debby is bound out to Mrs. Lane, a strict and proper woman. Debby is miserable in her new home and longs for her father and her old life. She befriends Jack Martin, a boy who shares her love of adventure and music. Debby's father joins the Continental Army, and she decides to disguise herself as a boy and follow him.

Debby, now known as Robert Shirtliffe, joins the army and becomes a drummer boy. She meets a young British officer named Morley, who looks uncannily like her. Morley is searching for a girl named Debby Mason, and Robert is determined to keep her true identity a secret. Robert becomes embroiled in a series of adventures and battles, including the Battle of Trenton, where she plays a crucial role in the American victory.

As the war rages on, Robert becomes increasingly exhausted and wounded. She is eventually discovered by Doctor Bell, a young surgeon who takes her under his care and nurses her back to health. Robert reveals her true identity as Debby Mason to Doctor Bell, who is shocked but supportive. Debby is granted an honorable discharge from the army and is given a sum of money to start a new life.

Debby travels to England to meet her relatives and learn more about her family's past. She meets her cousin's mother, who is shocked to learn that Debby is the one who killed her son in battle. Despite this revelation, the two women form a bond, and Debby's cousin's mother invites her to stay with her. Debby eventually returns to America, where she is reunited with Jack Martin and meets Doctor Bell's mother.

Debby and Doctor Bell fall in love, and he proposes to her. Debby accepts, and they get married. The story concludes with Debby reflecting on her past adventures and the lessons she has learned. She realizes that she has found a new sense of purpose and belonging with Doctor Bell and is grateful for the journey that has brought her to this point. Debby's story is one of courage, resilience, and self-discovery, as she navigates the challenges of war, identity, and love.
