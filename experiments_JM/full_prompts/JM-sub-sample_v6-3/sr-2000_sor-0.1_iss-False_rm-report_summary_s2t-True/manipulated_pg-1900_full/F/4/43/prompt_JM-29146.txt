You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is stranded on the planet Irwadi after the government planetarizes the Interstellar Transfer Service. He meets a beautiful Earthgirl named Margot Dennison, who claims to have bought an old starship and needs a pilot to take her to Centauri. Ramsey agrees to help her, and they set out to prepare the ship for departure. Along the way, they are joined by a Vegan girl named Vardin, who is fleeing from the Irwadian Security Police.

As they work on the ship, Ramsey discovers a letter in Margot's apartment that hints at a mysterious and powerful secret. The letter, written by Margot's father, mentions a "proto-man" who may have been the ancestor of all humanoid species in the galaxy. Margot becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the secrets of proto-man, and Ramsey begins to suspect that she is hiding something from him.

Despite his reservations, Ramsey agrees to take Margot and Vardin to Centauri. However, as they journey through hyper-space, the ship encounters a strange "shoal" that seems to be a world within the hyper-space continuum. Margot becomes convinced that this world is the home of proto-man and that it holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe.

As they explore the world, they discover a mysterious black box that appears to be a matter transmitter. Margot is determined to use the box to gain ultimate power, but Ramsey is hesitant, sensing that the power of the box is too great for anyone to wield. Vardin, who has been quiet until now, reveals that she is actually a member of an ancient species known as proto-man, who had created the box as a means of colonizing the galaxy.

Vardin explains that her people had discovered the power of the box, but it ultimately led to their downfall, as they became savages and lost their advanced technology. She warns Ramsey and Margot that the box is too powerful for humans to handle and that it will only lead to destruction. Despite this, Margot is determined to use the box, and Ramsey is forced to stop her.

In the end, Ramsey and Margot escape the planet, but not before Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, uses the box and is transformed into a caveman-like creature. Vardin disappears, leaving Ramsey and Margot to ponder the secrets of the universe and the dangers of playing with forces beyond human control. Ramsey and Margot realize that they have a chance to start anew and explore the galaxy together, free from the dangers of the box and the ambitions of those who would misuse its power.
