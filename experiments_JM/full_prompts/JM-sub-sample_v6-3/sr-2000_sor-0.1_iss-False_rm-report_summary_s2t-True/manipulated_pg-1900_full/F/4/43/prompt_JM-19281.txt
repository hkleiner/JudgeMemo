You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The document "One Common Faith" discusses the role of religion in addressing the world's challenges. In 2002, an open letter was sent to the world's religious leaders, highlighting the need for courage to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of God and religion. The letter acknowledged the achievements of the interfaith movement and encouraged religious leaders to face the implications of this truth honestly.

The response to the letter was encouraging, with many recipients expressing distress over the failure of religious institutions to assist humanity. Discussions turned to the need for fundamental change in how people relate to each other, and some recipients reproduced and distributed the letter to other clerics.

The document argues that the accelerating breakdown in social order calls for the religious spirit to be freed from the shackles that have prevented it from bringing about healing. Bahá'ís must draw on a deep understanding of the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves and recognize the gift of faith as inseparable from the responsibility to avail oneself of spiritual resources.

The world is experiencing a sea change in human consciousness, with a growing recognition of the need for spiritual and moral development. The materialistic interpretation of reality has been discredited, and people are seeking a new understanding of the purpose of existence. The document highlights the importance of recognizing the oneness of God and the unity of all religions.

The concept of progressive revelation is central to the document, which argues that each stage of revelation builds on the previous one, providing guidance for humanity's development. The document also discusses the role of religion in cultivating moral consciousness and shaping society, highlighting the need for a new understanding of religion's purpose.

The Bahá'í community is seen as a model for unity and cooperation, with its global reach and diversity. The document emphasizes the importance of education, legislation, and personal effort in promoting unity and moral development. Ultimately, the document argues that the power to achieve unity and address the world's challenges lies in the recognition of the oneness of God and the unity of all religions.

The document concludes by emphasizing the need for a new understanding of religion's role in the world and the importance of recognizing the oneness of God and the unity of all religions. It argues that this recognition is essential for addressing the world's challenges and promoting unity and cooperation among all people. The Bahá'í community is seen as a key player in this process, with its commitment to unity, justice, and the betterment of society.

The document also discusses the concept of the "Day of Resurrection," which refers to a time of great upheaval and transformation. It argues that this day is not a physical event, but a spiritual one, in which humanity will be called to account for its actions and will be given the opportunity to transform itself.

Overall, the document "One Common Faith" presents a vision of a unified and cooperative world, in which all people recognize the oneness of God and the unity of all religions. It argues that this recognition is essential for addressing the world's challenges and promoting peace, justice, and prosperity for all.
