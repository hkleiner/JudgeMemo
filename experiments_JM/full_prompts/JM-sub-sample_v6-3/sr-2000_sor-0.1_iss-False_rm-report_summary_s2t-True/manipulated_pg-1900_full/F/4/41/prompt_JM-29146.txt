You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is stranded on the planet Irwadi after the government planetarizes the Interstellar Transfer Service. He meets a beautiful Earthgirl, Margot Dennison, who offers him a job to take her through hyper-space to Centauri. Margot is searching for something, and Ramsey soon discovers that she is looking for the secret of proto-man, a legendary ancestor of all humanoid races. 

Ramsey, Margot, and a Vegan girl named Vardin work on an old spaceship, the Enterprise, in a Spacer Graveyard. They plan to escape from Irwadi, but their actions are being monitored by the Irwadian Security Police, led by Garr Symm. Symm is a scientist who has discovered a letter from Margot's father, which hints at the existence of proto-man and a powerful secret.

As they prepare to leave, Margot reveals that she has found a way to travel through hyper-space without feeling the effects of acceleration. Ramsey is skeptical, but they eventually take off and enter hyper-space. The ship encounters an eddy, and Ramsey struggles to maintain control. Margot takes over and brings the ship down on a mysterious world in hyper-space.

The group ventures out of the ship and finds themselves in a timeless, gray environment. They soon discover a black rectangular object, which Margot believes is a matter-transmitter. Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing chess with proto-man, and he realizes that the secret of proto-man is too powerful for humanity to handle.

Garr Symm and his men arrive, and a confrontation ensues. Ramsey fights off Symm's men, but not before they die from lack of air and cold, despite being in a timeless environment. Vardin reveals that she is not a Vegan girl but proto-man, a guardian who has been watching over humanity. She explains that her ancestors discovered matter-transmission but did not understand its power, leading to their downfall.

Vardin tells Ramsey to stop Margot from using the matter-transmitter, and he succeeds in subduing her. However, Garr Symm jumps into the box and is transformed into a caveman-like creature. Vardin leads Symm away, and Ramsey takes Margot back to the Enterprise. As they escape, Margot realizes that she has been driven by her pride and ambition, but she now loves Ramsey and wants to be with him. They blast off into space, ready to start a new life together.
