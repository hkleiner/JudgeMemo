You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The pamphlet "Russia's Part in the World War" aims to present Russia's role in the recent war. The author, Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, is a Russian Army officer and military expert. Russia's participation in the war was significant, with over 12 million casualties, including 3 million dead. The country's losses were more than twice those of France, four to five times those of England, and over 35 times those of America.

Russia's role in the war was crucial, as it diverted German forces and prevented them from concentrating on the Western front. The Russian Army's early offensive in East Prussia and Galicia forced the Germans to fight on two fronts, making their initial plan useless. Russia's actions also contributed to the early termination of the German offensive in France and compelled the Germans to abstain from main operations on the Western front for over a year.

In 1915, Russia shouldered the burden of the struggle against Germany, Austria, and Turkey, giving the Allies time to prepare for the coming German offensive at Verdun. The Russian Army's lack of arms and munitions made it difficult to achieve victories, but they still managed to defeat the Germans whenever they had a small superiority of force.

The Brusilov offensive in 1916 saved Italy from an Austrian offensive and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme. Russia also took upon itself the defense of a considerable stretch of the Romanian front. Throughout the war, Russia compelled the enemy to spend vast amounts of force, reserves, and munitions on the Russian front, hastening the enemy's inevitable fall.

The pamphlet also criticizes General Ludendorff's memoirs for distorting the truth about the Russian Army's role in the war. Ludendorff's claims of destroying 250,000 Russians with only two German corps are false, and his attempts to shift the blame to General Falkenhayn are unfounded.

Russia's sacrifices in the war were enormous, and its role was essential to the Allied victory. The country's losses in men, material, and treasure were staggering, and its participation in the war was crucial to preventing Germany from dominating Europe. The pamphlet concludes that Russia's great role in the World War confirms its importance as a factor in European politics and military equilibrium.

The future of Russia is also discussed, with the pamphlet noting that the country will always remain a significant military weight in Europe. The statesmen of the West must consider Russia's potential role in future conflicts and not underestimate its importance. The pamphlet warns against "ostrich politics" and emphasizes the need for wise leaders to reckon with Russia's eventual resurgence as a powerful nation.
