You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story revolves around Kuei Ping, a Chinese woman, and her journey towards self-discovery and freedom. The narrator dedicates the story to the women of America, highlighting the universal theme of women's struggles and aspirations. Kuei Ping's life is marked by her arranged marriage to Chia Fuh Tang, a man ten years her senior, and her subsequent entry into the Chia family compound.

As Kuei Ping navigates her new life, she begins to feel suffocated by the traditional expectations and customs of her family. She recalls her time at a mission school, where she was inspired by her teacher, Miss Porter, and the idea of personal freedom and equality. Kuei Ping's desire for freedom and autonomy grows, and she starts to question the traditional ways of her family.

Kuei Ping's husband, Fuh Tang, is initially supportive of her desires, but he eventually becomes addicted to opium, causing a rift in their relationship. Despite this, Kuei Ping continues to care for him and their son, Bo Te. As Fuh Tang's health declines, Kuei Ping takes on more responsibilities and begins to see the value in the traditional ways of her family.

After Fuh Tang's death, Kuei Ping is filled with a sense of regret and responsibility. She realizes that she had been so focused on her own desires that she had neglected her family's needs. Kuei Ping's daughter, born after Fuh Tang's death, brings her joy and a new sense of purpose.

Kuei Ping's story takes a turn as she begins to teach foreigners Chinese and starts to rebuild her life. She faces numerous challenges, including financial struggles and the loss of her daughter's health. However, she perseveres and eventually establishes a school and a church in her village.

Through their conversations, the narrator gains insight into Kuei Ping's journey and the cultural context in which she lived. Kuei Ping's story is one of resilience, adaptability, and the pursuit of freedom and self-discovery.

Kuei Ping shares her knowledge and experiences, teaching the narrator about the importance of patience, tenderness, and understanding. The narrator is struck by Kuei Ping's courage and determination, as well as her ability to balance traditional values with modern ideas.

The story concludes with Kuei Ping's dream of establishing a school and a church finally coming true. The narrator is witness to the realization of her dream and is inspired by her story.
