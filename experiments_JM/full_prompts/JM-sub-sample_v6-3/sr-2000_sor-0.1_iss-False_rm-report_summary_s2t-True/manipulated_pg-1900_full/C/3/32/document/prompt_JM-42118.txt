You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. He was raised in a family that valued commerce and thrift. Fragonard's early life was marked by a love for art, and he was eventually apprenticed to a painter. He later moved to Paris, where he studied under François Boucher, a renowned artist. Fragonard's artistic style was influenced by Boucher and the Dutch landscapists.

In 1756, Fragonard won the Prix de Rome, which allowed him to study in Italy. During his time in Italy, he was exposed to the works of Raphael and Michelangelo, but he remained true to his French artistic roots. Upon his return to Paris, Fragonard became a prominent artist, known for his landscapes and decorative paintings. He was particularly famous for his series of paintings, "The Progress of Love in the Heart of Maidenhood," which was rejected by his patron, Madame du Barry.

Fragonard married Marie Anne Gérard in 1769, and the couple had two children. He continued to paint, producing works that were highly regarded by his contemporaries. However, with the onset of the French Revolution, Fragonard's career began to decline. He was forced to flee Paris and eventually settled in Provence, where he continued to paint until his death on August 22, 1806.

Despite his decline in popularity during the Revolution, Fragonard's art has endured, and he is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of 18th-century France. His work embodies the spirit of the French Rococo period, characterized by elegance, lightness, and a sense of joie de vivre. Fragonard's legacy has been rediscovered, and his paintings are now celebrated for their beauty and charm.

Fragonard's life was marked by both success and hardship. He was a prolific artist, producing numerous paintings, drawings, and etchings. His work was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he was particularly known for his ability to capture the essence of the French countryside. Despite his later years being marked by decline and hardship, Fragonard remained a beloved figure in the art world, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers to this day.

The French Revolution had a profound impact on Fragonard's life and career. He was forced to flee Paris and settle in Provence, where he continued to paint until his death. Despite the challenges he faced, Fragonard remained committed to his art, and his later works continue to be celebrated for their beauty and charm. Fragonard's story is a testament to the enduring power of art to transcend time and circumstance.

Fragonard's artistic style was characterized by his use of light and color. He was particularly known for his ability to capture the play of light on water and the beauty of the French countryside. His paintings are highly regarded for their sense of movement and energy, and his use of color is both bold and subtle. Fragonard's legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers, and his paintings remain some of the most celebrated works of the French Rococo period.

In conclusion, Fragonard's life and career were marked by both success and hardship. He was a prolific artist, producing numerous paintings, drawings, and etchings. His work was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of 18th-century France. Despite the challenges he faced, Fragonard remained committed to his art, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers to this day.
