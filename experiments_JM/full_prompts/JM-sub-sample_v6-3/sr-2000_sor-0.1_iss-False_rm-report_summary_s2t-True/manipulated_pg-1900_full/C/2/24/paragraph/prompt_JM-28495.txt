You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The story begins with the narrator and his wife, Stella, trying to find the Home for Lost Dogs in Battersea to adopt a dog. They follow a man who works at the home, but he leads them on a wild goose chase, and they eventually give up. On their way home, they find a small, wet puppy in a pond, tied to a brick, and decide to adopt him. They name him Excalibur, or Scally for short.

As Scally grows up, he becomes a beloved member of the family and a constant companion to Stella's sister, Eileen. Eileen tries to teach Scally tricks, but he is not very successful. Scally is a gentle giant and loves everyone, including the village rabbit and the butcher's dog. He becomes a regular visitor to the village shops, where he is given treats and attention.

One day, Eileen meets a young curate named Gerald, and they fall in love. Scally plays a significant role in their courtship, often accompanying them on walks and providing a convenient excuse for them to spend time together. When Gerald has to leave the village, Eileen and Scally continue to live with Stella and her family.

Years pass, and Gerald and Eileen's relationship continues, although they are apart. Eileen visits Gerald occasionally, and Scally remains a loyal companion to both of them. When Stella's husband falls ill, Eileen decides to send Scally to live with Gerald in the north. Scally causes a sensation in London as he travels to meet Gerald, and they eventually board a train together.

The train is involved in an accident, and Gerald helps to rescue people from the wreckage. Excalibur assists him, and they become heroes. Lord Caversham, a director of the railway company, is grateful for their bravery and offers to help Gerald find a new position. Gerald asks for a curacy that will allow him to marry Eileen, and Lord Caversham agrees to help.

The story jumps forward in time, and Gerald and Eileen are now married with two children. They live in a rectory, and Scally is still a beloved member of the family. One day, a tramp comes to the door, and Eileen uses Scally to chase him away. The family is happy, and Scally remains a loyal and loving companion to them all.

Gerald is now a rector, and he and Eileen are living a happy life together. They have two children, and Scally is still a part of the family. The story concludes with Eileen using Scally to protect her family from a tramp, demonstrating the special bond between Scally and the family. Throughout the story, Scally's gentle and loving nature has brought people together and provided companionship and comfort.
