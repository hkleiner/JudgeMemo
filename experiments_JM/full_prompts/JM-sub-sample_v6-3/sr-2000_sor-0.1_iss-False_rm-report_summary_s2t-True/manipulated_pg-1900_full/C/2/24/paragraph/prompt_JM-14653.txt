You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author reflects on the changing nature of Christmas, suggesting that its magic has been lost for many adults. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it has become a source of tedium and insincerity. The author argues that this decline is due to the increasing skepticism and disillusionment of the age, which has led to a loss of faith in traditional values and institutions.

The author suggests that the cause of this decline is the work of idealists, such as scientists and philosophers, who have sought to uncover the truth about the world and human history. While their discoveries have been important, they have also led to a sense of uncertainty and doubt, which has eroded the traditional values and beliefs that underpinned Christmas.

Despite this, the author argues that the idea of goodwill and mutual support that underlies Christmas is still essential to human happiness and well-being. The author suggests that the key to revitalizing Christmas is to focus on cultivating goodwill and sympathy for others, rather than just going through the motions of traditional celebrations.

The author proposes a method for cultivating goodwill, which involves imagining oneself in another person's position and trying to understand their thoughts and feelings. This requires a regular and systematic effort, but it can lead to a deeper sense of connection and community with others.

The author also reflects on the nature of happiness and fulfillment, suggesting that they are not found in the attainment of external goals or possessions, but rather in the cultivation of inner qualities such as patience, acceptance, and a sense of purpose. The author argues that the pursuit of happiness is a lifelong journey, and that it requires a willingness to embrace challenges and difficulties as opportunities for growth and development.

Ultimately, the author suggests that Christmas can be a time for renewal and reflection, a chance to reconnect with others and with our own values and aspirations. By focusing on the cultivation of goodwill and sympathy, we can create a more meaningful and fulfilling celebration that brings us closer to ourselves and to those around us. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of human connection and community, and the need to prioritize these values in our lives.
