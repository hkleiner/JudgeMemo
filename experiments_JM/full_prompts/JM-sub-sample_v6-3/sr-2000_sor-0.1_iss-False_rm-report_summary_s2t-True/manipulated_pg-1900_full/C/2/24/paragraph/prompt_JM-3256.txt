You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author discusses the concept of a "bookman," someone who has a deep love and appreciation for books. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but rather someone who has a passion for reading and collecting books. The author recounts a story about a man who invited him to dinner and showed off his expensive bookcase, but it was clear that the man was not a true bookman. A true bookman is someone who loves books for their content, not just their physical appearance.

The author also shares a story about a Colonial squatter who wrote to a friend asking for books to be sent to him. The friend sent a collection of English literature, but the squatter was disappointed that there were no new works by William Shakespeare or John Milton. Despite this, the squatter had a good instinct for literature, as he was drawn to the classics.

The author notes that a bookman's taste in books is not limited to any particular genre or subject. They may enjoy reading detective stories, essays, or historical romances. The author mentions several authors and books that they enjoy, including Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, and Thomas De Quincey.

A bookman's love of books is not just about reading, but also about collecting and owning physical copies of books. The author describes the joy of handling and admiring beautiful books, and the satisfaction of adding a new book to one's collection. However, this love of books can also be a source of temptation and struggle, as the author notes that a bookman may be tempted to spend too much money on books or to prioritize book collecting over other responsibilities.

The author also discusses the idea that a bookman's love of books is not just a personal preference, but also a way of connecting with others who share similar interests. They imagine a gathering of bookmen, including famous collectors and authors, and describe the pleasure of discussing books and sharing knowledge with others.

Ultimately, the author concludes that a bookman's love of books is a source of comfort, joy, and inspiration. It provides a sense of connection to others and to the past, and offers a way to escape the stresses and worries of everyday life. The author quotes Emerson, who said that "the book is a sure friend, always ready at your first leisure, opens to the very page you desire, and shuts at your first fatigue." The author agrees, and notes that a bookman's love of books is a treasure that will remain with them throughout their life. 

The author's own love of books is evident throughout the text, and they share several personal anecdotes about their favorite books and authors. They note that their love of books has been a source of comfort and inspiration throughout their life, and express gratitude for the joy that books have brought them. 

In addition to the personal anecdotes, the author also discusses the idea that a bookman's love of books can be a source of personal growth and development. They note that reading and collecting books can help to broaden one's knowledge and understanding of the world, and can provide a sense of purpose and meaning. 

Overall, the author's discussion of the bookman provides a nuanced and thoughtful exploration of the love of books and the joy of reading. It highlights the importance of books in our lives, and celebrates the pleasure and comfort that they can bring. 

The author's use of language is also noteworthy, as they employ a range of literary devices and techniques to convey their love of books. They use vivid imagery and descriptive language to bring their favorite books and authors to life, and employ rhetorical devices such as metaphor and allusion to add depth and complexity to their argument. 

In conclusion, the author's discussion of the bookman is a rich and nuanced exploration of the love of books and the joy of reading. It provides a personal and thoughtful perspective on the importance of books in our lives, and celebrates the pleasure and comfort that they can bring.
