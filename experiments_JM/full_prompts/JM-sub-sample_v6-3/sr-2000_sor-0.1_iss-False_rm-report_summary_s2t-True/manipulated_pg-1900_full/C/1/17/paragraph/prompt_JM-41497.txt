You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned British painter born in 1723. He was determined to succeed and became a great painter, co-founding the Royal Academy of Arts. Reynolds' early life was marked by a strong desire to learn and improve his craft. He studied the works of great masters, including Michelangelo, Titian, and Rembrandt, and developed his own unique style.

Reynolds' time in Italy, where he studied the Vatican frescoes and copied the works of great masters, was invaluable to his development as an artist. He was particularly influenced by the Venetian school and the works of Ludovico Caracci and Guido. Upon his return to England, Reynolds established himself as a prominent portrait painter, and his studio became a hub for the intellectual and artistic elite.

Reynolds was known for his exceptional ability to capture the character and essence of his sitters. His portraits are renowned for their simplicity, directness, and expression of character. He was particularly skilled at painting men, and his portraits of notable figures such as Charles James Fox and David Garrick are considered masterpieces.

Despite his success, Reynolds faced challenges, including the loss of his hearing and struggles with the chemistry of pigments. Many of his paintings have not aged well, and some have undergone restoration. However, his legacy as one of the greatest British painters remains unchanged.

Reynolds was a complex figure, with both admirable and flawed qualities. He was known for his self-control and reserve, but also had a touch of snobbery and jealousy. His relationships with women, including the courtesan Angelica Kaufmann, were the subject of much speculation.

Throughout his life, Reynolds was driven by a desire to create art that would endure. He delivered annual discourses to the Royal Academy, in which he shared his insights on art and beauty. Reynolds' later years were marked by a decline in his health, and he eventually stopped painting due to his failing eyesight.

Reynolds passed away in 1792, at the age of 69, and was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. His legacy continues to be celebrated, and his paintings remain some of the most iconic and enduring works of British art. Despite the challenges he faced, Reynolds' determination and passion for his craft have left an indelible mark on the art world.

Reynolds' impact on British art cannot be overstated. He played a crucial role in establishing the Royal Academy and promoting the arts in Britain. His influence can be seen in the work of many other artists, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers to this day.

In conclusion, Sir Joshua Reynolds was a remarkable artist and a true giant of British art. His life, work, and legacy continue to fascinate and inspire us, and his paintings remain a testament to his enduring talent and creativity.
