You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The book "The Feast of St. Friend" explores the concept of Christmas and its significance in modern times. The author argues that Christmas has lost some of its magic and that people have become disillusioned with the festival. However, the author believes that the spirit of Christmas, which is centered on goodwill and friendship, is still alive and relevant.

The author suggests that the decline of Christmas is due to the rise of skepticism and the loss of faith in traditional values. The age of doubt and skepticism, ushered in by great philosophers and scientists such as Darwin and Huxley, has led to a decline in the belief in the supernatural and the sacred.

Despite this, the author argues that the idea of goodwill and friendship is still essential to human existence. The author proposes that the cultivation of goodwill is the key to revitalizing the festival of Christmas. This can be achieved by practicing sympathetic imagination, which involves putting oneself in another person's shoes and understanding their feelings and perspectives.

The author also emphasizes the importance of festivals and celebrations in bringing people together and fostering a sense of community. The custom of present-giving, for example, is a way of showing sympathy and goodwill towards others. The author argues that the excess and extravagance associated with Christmas are not necessarily bad things, but rather a natural expression of human joy and celebration.

In order to revitalize the festival of Christmas, the author suggests that people should focus on cultivating goodwill and friendship in their daily lives. This can be done by practicing sympathetic imagination, being more considerate and thoughtful towards others, and making an effort to understand and appreciate their perspectives.

The author also explores the idea that the struggle and effort involved in achieving our goals and ambitions are essential to human happiness. The attainment of perfection is not possible, and it is the struggle itself that gives life its meaning and purpose. The author argues that people should not wait for the perfect moment or circumstances to start living, but rather should make the most of the present moment and strive to improve themselves and their relationships with others.

Ultimately, the author believes that the feast of Christmas, or the "Feast of St. Friend," is a celebration of the importance of human friendship and goodwill. By cultivating these values and practicing sympathetic imagination, people can revitalize the festival of Christmas and make it a more meaningful and enjoyable experience. The author concludes that real happiness consists in accepting the fact that discontent is a condition of life and striving to adjust conduct to an ideal, and that the struggle itself is what gives life its meaning and purpose.
