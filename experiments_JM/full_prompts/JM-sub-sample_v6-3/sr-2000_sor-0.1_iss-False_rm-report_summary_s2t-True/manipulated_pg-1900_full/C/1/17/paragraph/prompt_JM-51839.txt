You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Nacogdoches, Texas, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. The city was founded by the Tejas Indians and was later settled by Spanish and French colonizers. In 1716, the Spanish established the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches, which became a key location for trade and commerce. The city's strategic location made it an important stop for travelers and traders.

In the early 19th century, Nacogdoches became a hub for the Texas Revolution, with many prominent figures, including Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin, passing through the city. The Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 marked a significant turning point in the revolution, as the Mexican army was defeated and the city was secured by the Texans.

After the revolution, Nacogdoches continued to grow and develop, with the establishment of the Nacogdoches University in 1845. The city became a center for education and culture, with many notable figures, including Thomas J. Rusk and Charles S. Taylor, calling Nacogdoches home.

The city's history is also marked by its role in the Civil War, with many Nacogdoches residents fighting for the Confederacy. The war had a devastating impact on the city, with many buildings and homes destroyed. However, the city was rebuilt, and by the late 19th century, Nacogdoches had become a thriving commercial center.

Today, Nacogdoches is a thriving city with a rich history and culture. The city is home to many historic sites, including the Old Stone Fort, the Mission Nuestra Senora de la Purissima Concepcion, and the Nacogdoches University building. Visitors can explore these sites and learn about the city's fascinating history.

The Old Stone Fort, in particular, has played a significant role in Nacogdoches' history, serving as a trading post, a military outpost, and even a home for some of the city's early residents. The fort has been rebuilt and restored over the years and now serves as a museum and a testament to the city's rich history.

Nacogdoches is also home to many other historic sites, including the Oak Grove Cemetery, where many of the city's early residents are buried, and the Adolphus Sterne Home, which was built in the 1830s and is now a museum. The city's historic downtown area features many beautifully restored buildings, including the Old North Church and the Episcopal Church.

The city's Masonic Lodge, Milam Lodge No. 2, has a long history dating back to 1837 and has played an important role in the city's development. Many notable figures, including Sam Houston, have been members of the lodge, and it continues to be an important part of the city's community.

Overall, Nacogdoches is a city with a rich and fascinating history, from its early days as a Tejas Indian settlement to its current status as a thriving commercial and cultural center. Visitors can explore the city's many historic sites, learn about its history, and experience the warm hospitality of its residents.
