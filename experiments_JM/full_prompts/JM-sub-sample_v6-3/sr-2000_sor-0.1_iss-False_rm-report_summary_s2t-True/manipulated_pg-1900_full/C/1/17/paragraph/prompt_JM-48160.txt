You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author describes her experiences in France during World War I, particularly in the war zone. She notes that France is divided into two sections: one where life is relatively normal, and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, one needs a special permit, known as a carnet rouge. The author recounts her difficulties in obtaining this permit, despite having connections with influential people.

She eventually obtains the permit and visits several towns in the war zone, including Châlons, Bar-le-Duc, and Nancy. She describes the devastation and destruction she sees, including burned fields, ruined buildings, and makeshift hospitals. She also meets with soldiers, officers, and civilians, who share their stories and experiences with her.

The author is struck by the calm and stoicism of the French people, particularly the soldiers, who seem to be unaffected by the war. She notes that the women, on the other hand, are often anxious and worried about their loved ones. She also comments on the poverty and scarcity of resources in the war zone, where even basic necessities like food and medicine are in short supply.

The author visits several hospitals, including the Savonières hospital near Bar-le-Duc, where she sees the wounded soldiers and meets with the nurses and doctors. She is impressed by the care and dedication of the medical staff, but also notes the scarcity of resources and the difficulties they face in providing adequate care.

She also describes her experiences with the military authorities, who are often bureaucratic and restrictive. She notes that the French military is highly disciplined and organized, but also sometimes inflexible and unyielding. Despite these challenges, the author is determined to see the war zone for herself and to report on the experiences of the people living there.

The author also mentions her involvement with the organization "Le Bienêtre du Blessé," which aims to provide comfort and support to wounded soldiers. She notes that the organization is struggling to provide adequate care and resources, due to the scarcity of funds and the difficulties of working in the war zone.

Throughout her account, the author reflects on the human cost of the war and the impact it has on individuals and communities. She notes that the war has created a sense of numbness and detachment, particularly among the soldiers, who seem to be desensitized to the violence and destruction around them. Despite this, she also sees moments of kindness, compassion, and resilience, particularly among the civilians, who are struggling to survive and rebuild their lives in the midst of war.
