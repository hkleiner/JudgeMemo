You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The narrator, a literary critic, recalls his encounter with George Corvick, who had been tasked with reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel. Corvick was breathless and worried, having received a telegram from Gwendolen Erme, and had to leave for Paris. The narrator was asked to prepare an article on Vereker's novel for "The Middle" magazine. He was excited to meet Vereker, who was to be at Lady Jane's house, and wanted to make a good impression.

The narrator read Vereker's novel and wrote a review, which Lady Jane praised. However, when Vereker himself commented on the review, he called it "the usual twaddle." The narrator was disappointed and felt that Vereker was cruelly conceited. Later, Vereker explained to the narrator that his review had missed the point of his writing, and that he had a "little point" that he tried to convey through his work.

The narrator learned that Corvick had gone to India and had discovered Vereker's secret. Corvick wrote to the narrator, saying that he had found the "figure in the carpet" and that it was immense. The narrator was eager to know more, but Corvick died in an accident before he could reveal the secret. The narrator then tried to get the information from Corvick's wife, Gwendolen, but she refused to tell him.

Gwendolen eventually married Drayton Deane, and the narrator expected that Deane would write about Vereker's secret. However, Deane never did, and the narrator realized that Gwendolen had not shared the secret with him. The narrator finally approached Deane and asked him about the secret, but Deane claimed that he did not know anything about it. The narrator was shocked and realized that Gwendolen had not thought Deane worthy of knowing the secret.

The narrator reflected on the events and realized that he had been mistaken in his assumptions about Deane. He also felt a sense of consolation in knowing that Deane was now also a victim of unappeased desire, searching for the secret that the narrator had been seeking for so long. The narrator's story is a testament to the power of obsession and the lengths to which people will go to uncover a hidden truth. In the end, the narrator is left with a sense of wonder and curiosity, still searching for the elusive secret that Vereker had hidden in his writing.
