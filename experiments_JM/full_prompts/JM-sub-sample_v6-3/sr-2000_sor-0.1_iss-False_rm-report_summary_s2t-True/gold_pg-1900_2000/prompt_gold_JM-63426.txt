You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The introduction to Will Bradley's book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts. Bradley's work brought a fresh and vibrant style to the field, which was previously stagnant. He is credited with introducing American colonial typography and creating a unique, non-archaic, and exuberant design style. Bradley's career spanned several decades, and he worked on various projects, including magazines, newspapers, and advertising.

Bradley's early life is also discussed, starting from his childhood in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1875. He was a curious and artistic child, often drawing on the blackboard in his classroom. Bradley's father was a cartoonist, and he would often bring home boxes of type, which sparked Bradley's interest in printing. After his father's death, Bradley's family moved to Northern Michigan, where he attended school and eventually began working at a local print shop.

At the age of 12, Bradley started working at the Iron Agitator, a newspaper in Ishpeming, Michigan. He learned the basics of printing and quickly became skilled in feeding and setting type. Bradley's wages increased as he took on more responsibilities, and he eventually became the job printer and foreman at the age of 15. He worked hard, often in challenging conditions, to learn the trade and support himself.

Bradley's experiences at the print shop were not without challenges. The shop was often cold, and he had to find creative ways to keep the stove and boiler going. He also encountered traveling fakers who would try to scam local merchants. Despite these challenges, Bradley persevered and continued to develop his skills as a printer and designer.

The text also touches on Bradley's personal life, including his relationships with his family and friends. He had a close relationship with his mother, who encouraged his artistic pursuits.

Throughout the text, Bradley's determination and passion for his work are evident, and his legacy as a pioneering figure in American graphic arts is clear.

Overall, the introduction to Will Bradley's book provides a fascinating glimpse into his life and career. From his early days as a curious and artistic child to his rise as a prominent figure in American graphic arts, Bradley's story is one of perseverance, creativity, and innovation. His impact on the field is still felt today, and his work continues to inspire new generations of designers and artists. Bradley's legacy is a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and a passion for creative expression.
