You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born on March 16, 1822, in Bordeaux, France, to a family of artists. Her father, Raymond Bonheur, was a painter and drawing master, and her mother, Sophie Marquis, was a musician. The family struggled financially, and Raymond had to work multiple jobs to support them. In 1828, the family's friends, the Silvelas, moved to Paris and encouraged Raymond to join them, promising a better life and more opportunities for his art.

Raymond eventually made the move to Paris, leaving his family behind, and found success as a drawing instructor and artist. He was able to support his family and bring them to Paris in 1829. Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school, where she developed boyish manners and a strong personality. She was fascinated by art and spent most of her time drawing and painting.

As Rosa grew older, her father tried to find her a suitable occupation, but she showed no interest in traditional feminine pursuits like sewing or music. She was eventually allowed to stay at home and work in her father's studio, where she developed her artistic skills. Her father discovered her talent when she created a well-drawn and painted canvas of a bunch of cherries.

Rosa's father encouraged her to continue pursuing art, and she began to study the works of the great masters at the Louvre. She spent hours copying and learning from the paintings, earning her the nickname "the little hussard" among the other students. Rosa's dedication and hard work paid off, and she eventually found her niche as an animal painter.

She spent hours studying animals, learning about their anatomy, and practicing sculpture. She even kept a menagerie in her home, with animals like sheep, goats, and birds. In 1841, Rosa submitted her first paintings to the Salon, a prestigious art exhibition in Paris. Her work was accepted, and she continued to submit paintings annually, eventually gaining recognition and critical acclaim.

Rosa's success was not overnight, and she faced many challenges and criticisms along the way. However, her passion and dedication to her art ultimately paid off, and she became one of the most renowned animal painters of her time. Throughout her life, Rosa continued to work tirelessly, studying and painting animals, and her art remains a testament to her talent and perseverance. 

Rosa's family played an important role in her life, and her father's support and encouragement were instrumental in her success. Her mother's death in 1833 was a significant loss, but her father's remarriage and continued support helped Rosa to stay focused on her art. Rosa's siblings, including her brothers Auguste and Isidore, also played a role in her life, although less is known about their relationships.

Overall, Rosa Bonheur's life was marked by her passion for art, her dedication to her craft, and her perseverance in the face of challenges. Her story is an inspiration to artists and anyone who has ever pursued their dreams, and her art continues to be celebrated and admired to this day.
