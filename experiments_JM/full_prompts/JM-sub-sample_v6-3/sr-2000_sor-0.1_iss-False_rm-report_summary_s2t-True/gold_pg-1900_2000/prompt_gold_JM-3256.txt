You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The author wants to discuss the bookman, rather than his books, and define what a bookman is. A bookman is not just someone who owns many books, but someone who has a deep love and appreciation for literature. Having many books does not necessarily make someone a bookman, as they may be a collector or a seller. A true bookman is born, not made, and has a natural affinity for literature.

The author recounts a story about a man who invited him to dinner and showed off his expensive bookcase, but it was clear that he was not a bookman. The books were locked behind glass doors, and the owner seemed more interested in showing off his wealth than in discussing literature. A bookman, on the other hand, wants to be able to access his books easily and read them frequently.

The author also tells the story of a colonial squatter who asked a friend to send him some books, and the friend spent a month selecting the best of English literature. However, the squatter's response was disappointing, as he simply asked if any new books had been written by Shakespeare or Milton. Despite this, the author believes that the squatter showed a natural instinct for literature by fixating on these two classics.

The author argues that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between good and bad literature, and who has a deep appreciation for the classics. They may enjoy lighter reading, such as detective stories, but they also have a sense of what is truly great literature. The author cites the example of Mark Rutherford, a lesser-known author who wrote a historical romance that is still worth reading today.

The author believes that the role of the critic is to distinguish between books that are fleeting and those that are truly great and will stand the test of time. A great book is one that enriches the human mind and speaks to all people in a unique and timeless way. The author quotes the French critic Sainte-Beuve, who says that a classic book is one that has wisdom and a form that transcends any single age.

The author concludes that a bookman is someone who is catholic in their tastes and has a deep appreciation for all kinds of literature. They do not require an apology to enjoy a book, and they are not limited by sectarian or ideological boundaries. A bookman wants to have a complete collection of the classics, and they are willing to seek out rare and hard-to-find books to add to their library. Ultimately, the author believes that being a bookman is a matter of passion and dedication, rather than just a matter of owning a lot of books.
