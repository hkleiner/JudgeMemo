You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age. In 1538, a writ of summons was sent to Thomas Becket, who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before King Henry VIII. The shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr was destroyed, and his name was erased from records. However, this did not mark the end of pilgrimages to Canterbury. In the 20th century, a new enthusiasm for the site of the shrine emerged, and many people began to visit the city.

The old Pilgrims' Way from Winchester to Canterbury has been rediscovered, and many people now walk this route to experience the beauty of the surrounding hills. Some pilgrims, however, take the train and miss out on the scenic views. The city of Canterbury has a long history, dating back to the Roman era, when it was known as Durovernum. The Romans built roads, houses, and public buildings, and the city became an important center.

After the Romans left Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded, and the city was abandoned. It was later rebuilt, and the new settlers called it Cantwarabyrig, which means "the city of the men of Kent." In 561, Ethelbert began to reign, and Canterbury became the most important place in Kent. The city was heathen until 597, when Augustine landed and began to preach Christianity. Ethelbert was baptized, and the Saxons soon began to embrace the new faith.

Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city has undergone many changes, including the destruction of the shrine of St. Thomas the Martyr, but it remains an important center of Christianity. The church of St. Martin's is believed to be one of the oldest churches in England, and it may have been built during the Roman occupation. However, the exact date of its construction is still a matter of debate among historians and archaeologists.

The city's history is complex, with many different cultures and influences shaping its development. From the Romans to the Anglo-Saxons, and from the medieval period to the present day, Canterbury has played an important role in English history. The city's association with Christianity has been a constant theme throughout its history, and it continues to be an important center of worship and pilgrimage. Despite the many changes it has undergone, Canterbury remains a city with a rich and fascinating history. 

Today, pilgrims can still walk the old Pilgrims' Way and experience the beauty of the city and its surroundings. The city's historic buildings, including the cathedral and St. Martin's church, are still standing, and they continue to attract visitors from all over the world. Whether by train or on foot, pilgrims can still make their way to Canterbury and experience the city's unique history and culture. 

In conclusion, the city of Canterbury has a long and complex history, with many different cultures and influences shaping its development. From the Romans to the present day, the city has played an important role in English history, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity and pilgrimage.
