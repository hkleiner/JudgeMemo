You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) Read and understand the summary of the text the report was created for.
    b) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    c) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

The summary of the text to be evaluated is given below:
Summary: The Bahá'í community addressed an open letter to the world's religious leaders in 2002, highlighting the need for organized religion to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the unity of God and religion. The letter emphasized the importance of this recognition in addressing the religious crisis and promoting unity among people. The response to the letter was encouraging, with many recipients expressing distress over the failure of religious institutions to assist humanity in dealing with spiritual and moral challenges.

The Bahá'í community believes that the time has come for religious leadership to face the implications of the truth that God is one and that religion is likewise one. This principle has the capacity to ensure the continuing relevance of the great revealed faiths. The community feels hopeful that their initiative may serve as a catalyst for new understanding and change.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in religion and spirituality, with people seeking a personal identity that transcends the physical. This search is expressed in various ways, including a re-examination of people's sense of themselves and their purpose in life. The Bahá'í community sees this development as an opportunity for growth and transformation.

The materialistic interpretation of reality that dominated the 20th century has been eroded, and people are now seeking a more spiritual and moral framework for their lives. The bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise has led to a re-evaluation of values and a search for new meaning. The Bahá'í community believes that their message of unity and spiritual growth can contribute to this search and help to create a more just and peaceful world.

The world is experiencing a sea change in human consciousness, with people seeking a more spiritual and moral way of life. The Bahá'í community is responding to this need by promoting their message of unity and spiritual growth. They believe that their teachings can help to elevate discussion of religious issues above sectarian and transient considerations.

The community is drawing on the insights of Bahá'u'lláh's writings to understand the process by which humanity's spiritual life evolves. They recognize that the task of ensuring that His message is engaged by people everywhere is a responsibility that has been laid primarily on their shoulders. The community is committed to responding to this need and to promoting a deeper understanding of the spiritual nature of human existence.

In order to exert its influence, the principle of the unity of God and religion must operate at the heart of religious discourse. The Bahá'í community believes that this recognition is essential for addressing the religious crisis and promoting unity among people. They are hopeful that their initiative will serve as a catalyst for new understanding and change, and that their message of unity and spiritual growth will contribute to the creation of a more just and peaceful world.

The reawakened interest in religion is far from having reached its peak, and the phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum. The most obvious cause of these re-evaluations has been the bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise itself. The Bahá'í community sees this development as an opportunity for growth and transformation, and they are committed to promoting their message of unity and spiritual growth.

The world is at a critical juncture, and the need for a spiritual and moral framework for life is more pressing than ever. The Bahá'í community believes that their teachings can help to address this need and promote a more just and peaceful world. They are hopeful that their initiative will serve as a catalyst for new understanding and change, and that their message of unity and spiritual growth will contribute to the creation of a brighter future for all humanity.
