You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8846):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is considered one of the greatest painters of peasant life, alongside masters like Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, which can be attributed to his gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters like Andrea Mantegna. His paintings, such as "The Angelus," capture the struggles and simple faith of rural life, and are not sentimental but rather infused with intense earnestness and melancholy truth. Millet's unique style, which is subdued and restrained, is deeply rooted in his connection to the natural world and the people he depicted. As a painter, Millet's strength lies not in technical brilliance, but in his ability to convey a profound message and emotional depth in his work.
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "A long interval elapsed betwixted" should be "between"
        • "Millet can was considered" should be "Millet can be considered"
        • "coulded" should be "could"
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "betwixted" is an archaic or incorrect spelling
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The text jumps abruptly from discussing Millet's life to analyzing his painting "The Angelus"
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The connection between the discussion of Brueghel and Millet's work could be smoother

Section section_02 (Chars 8847–12750):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and simplicity of rural life, often focusing on the loneliness and hardships of the peasant's labor. His work reveals a philosophical mind that grappled with the problems of life, and his poverty and connection to the natural world likely influenced his artistic perspective. Overall, Millet's art is marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep understanding of the human experience.
