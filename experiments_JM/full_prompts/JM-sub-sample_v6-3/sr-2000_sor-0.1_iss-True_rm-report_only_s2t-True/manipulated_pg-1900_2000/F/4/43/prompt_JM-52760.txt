You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8192):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to the siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key step towards ending the war, as it would cut off Richmond's supplies and likely lead to the city's abandonment.

Section section_02 (Chars 8193–12931):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the "Dimmock Line," was constructed around Petersburg, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line's length and size proved to be a disadvantage, requiring more troops to defend it than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River to face a significantly smaller Confederate force under General Beauregard.
