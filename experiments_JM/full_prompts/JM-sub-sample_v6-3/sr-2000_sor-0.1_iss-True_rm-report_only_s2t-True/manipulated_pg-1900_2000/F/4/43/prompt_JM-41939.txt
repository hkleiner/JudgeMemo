You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8524):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a drawing master and her mother Sophie Marquis a music teacher. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age, and her father eventually allowed her to use his studio to sketch and paint. After trying various occupations, including being apprenticed to a dressmaker and attending school, Rosa's father recognized her artistic talent and encouraged her to pursue it. Her first painting, a still life of a bunch of cherries, showed promise and her father's words of encouragement sparked her ambition to become an artist. Rosa's determination and energy set her on a path to develop her artistic skills, which would eventually lead to great successes.

Section section_02 (Chars 8525–12746):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, also known as "the little hussard," spent her early years studying art at the Louvre and in her father's studio, where she developed a strong foundation in line-work and anatomy. She lived in various locations in Paris, including the Rue Rumford, where she was surrounded by farms and animals, which sparked her passion for painting animals. Rosa's dedication to her craft led her to study animal anatomy, sculpture, and dissection, and she even kept a menagerie in her home to observe and draw her subjects. In 1841, at the age of 19, she submitted her first paintings to the Salon, which were accepted, and she continued to exhibit her work annually, eventually gaining recognition from critics for her sincere and vigorous talent. Through her hard work and perseverance, Rosa established herself as a skilled painter of animals, known for her attention to detail and ability to capture their physiognomies and actions with fidelity and art.
