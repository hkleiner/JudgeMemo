You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8771):
Section Summary: The author participated in a historic movement, sending 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands on July 23, 1901. This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to bring benefits to the conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's natural beauty and cultural attractions, such as the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. As they crossed the International Date Line, the crew and passengers celebrated with the traditional "Revels of Neptune". Upon arriving in Manila, the group was introduced to the local culture and customs, including the unique clothing and habits of the native people.

Section section_02 (Chars 8771–11938):
Section Summary: The narrator arrived in Manila during the rainy season, which made their clothing wet and uncomfortable. The city of Manila was built by the Spaniards and has a rich history, with an old walled city and a new city that has sprung up around it. The narrator observed the bustling city life on the old stone bridge, where they saw a diverse mix of people, including foreigners and Filipinos of different classes and backgrounds. The city was filled with activity, including pedestrians, vehicles, and boats in the river, showcasing its cosmopolitan nature. After spending two weeks in Manila, the narrator and others received a notice instructing them to prepare for assignment to their stations, which caused consternation among them.
