You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7792):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a picturesque and romantic setting, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he was aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. However, Fragonard's own life took a different turn when his father apprenticed him to a notary, a path that did not suit the young man's artistic inclinations. Eventually, his notary master recognized Fragonard's passion for art and advised that he be allowed to pursue his creative interests.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–12969):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, impressed by the boy's potential but aware of his lack of skill, advised him to train with Chardin, a master of still-life painting. However, Fragonard made little progress under Chardin and was eventually sent away, after which he honed his skills by copying masterpieces from memory. He later returned to Boucher, who took him under his wing, and Fragonard went on to win the prestigious Prix de Rome at the age of 20. Under Boucher's guidance and later as a student at the king's school, Fragonard developed his skills and produced notable works, including "Blind Man's Buff".
