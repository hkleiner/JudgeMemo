You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–9016):
Section Summary: The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which broke the continuity between the old order and the new. The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a self-contained village system, a sparse population, and a genuine aristocracy that held political power. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and kindled a strong sense of patriotism in England, isolating it from European thought. The Victorian Age was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order.

  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • missing or incorrect articles
    - [SPELLING]:
        • typos (e.g. "saeculum mirabile" should be "saeculum mirabilis" is not an error, but "profunrly" instead of "profoundly", "yhe" instead of "the", "sxholars" instead of "scholars")

        • some words may be less familiar to modern readers
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • abrupt shifts between ideas (e.g. from discussing the pendulum of history to describing the Victorian Age)

Section section_02 (Chars 9017–13017):
Section Summary: During the early 19th century, England's intellectual life continued to thrive despite the war, with notable literary figures like Scott, Wordsworth, and Jane Austen. However, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and poor living conditions prevalent, as described by Byron and others. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises, which were exacerbated by over-population and a low standard of civilization. The introduction of food from America and Australia later helped to alleviate some of these issues. Despite these challenges, the country experienced significant progress during the first half of the reign, with advancements in education, liberty, and economic growth.
