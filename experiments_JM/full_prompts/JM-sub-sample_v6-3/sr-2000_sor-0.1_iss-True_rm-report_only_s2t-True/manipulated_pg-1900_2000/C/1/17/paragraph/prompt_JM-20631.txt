You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8508):
Section Summary: The section begins with a foreword by Herbert Samuel, honoring the memory of Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar who dedicated his life to promoting Hebraic thought and learning. Davis's work contributed to the revival of the Hebrew language, which is unique in that it has shown signs of renewing its vitality after being preserved for centuries as a ritual language. The concept of the Jews as a "Chosen People" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. This idea is rooted in biblical passages and is still reflected in some Jewish prayers and traditions, which express a desire for material prosperity and ultimate glory. The section sets the stage for a discussion of the complex and often contentious concept of the "Chosen People" and its implications for Jewish identity and relations with other nations.

Section section_02 (Chars 8509–11471):
Section Summary: The passage discusses the seeming ferocity of certain biblical passages, including the Psalmist's appeal to God to pour out wrath on the heathen. However, it notes that these passages are often taken out of context and that the concept of a dominant Israel is also tied to the idea of being righteous. The passage also highlights that similar sentiments of revenge and anger can be found in modern times, even among non-Jews, and that these feelings are often seen as a natural response to injustice. The concept of a Chosen People and other biblical ideas must be interpreted through the lens of life and experience, rather than through allegory or literal interpretation. Ultimately, the passage suggests that understanding the Bible requires a nuanced and contextual approach.
