You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8778):
Section Summary: Joshua Reynolds was a talented and determined individual who was born with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career as a painter. He was not a genius, but rather a clever and hardworking young man who was determined to make a name for himself in the art world. Reynolds' journey to Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, was a pivotal moment in his career, and it was there that he developed his technique and style. Upon his return to England, Reynolds became a leading portrait painter and played a key role in the establishment of the Royal Academy, where he served as the first president and delivered annual discourses to students. Through his work and teachings, Reynolds left a lasting impact on the art world, and his legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.

Section section_02 (Chars 8779–12342):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds quickly achieved success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. As his career grew, he moved to larger studios, first to Great Newport Street and then to Leicester Square, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Reynolds was not only a talented artist but also a man of the world, who chose his friends wisely and was inspired by the company of notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Despite his accomplishments, Reynolds had his flaws, including a touch of snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which were somewhat refined through his associations with distinguished people. Overall, Reynolds' life and work are more interesting when seen in their entirety, flaws and all, rather than being idealized or sanitized.
