# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7852):
Section Summary: The narrator, a young writer, is given the task of reviewing Hugh Vereker's new novel by his friend George Corvick, who is unable to do it himself due to a personal emergency. The narrator is eager to meet Vereker, a renowned author, and sees this as an opportunity to make a good impression. After writing the review, the narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unsure if he has read the review and is hesitant to bring it up. Vereker's pleasant and affable nature makes the narrator want him to read the review, which he believes does justice to his work. Ultimately, it is Lady Jane who brings attention to the review, praising it and potentially doing for the narrator what he couldn't do for himself.

Section section_02 (Chars 7852–15627):
Section Summary: The narrator's review of Hugh Vereker's book was praised by Lady Jane, but when Vereker himself commented on it, he called it "the usual twaddle", which hurt the narrator's feelings. However, later that evening, Vereker approached the narrator and apologized for his earlier comment, explaining that he had been misunderstood. Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the true point of his work. He confided in the narrator, sharing his feelings of being a failure despite his success, and the two connected over their shared love of literature. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kindness and sincerity, and his initial hurt was replaced by a deeper understanding and appreciation of the author.

Section section_03 (Chars 15627–23318):
Section Summary: The narrator is discussing literature with Vereker, who hints at a hidden meaning or "little point" in his writing that he considers the core of his work. Vereker describes this idea as the "particular thing" that drives him to write and is the central theme that runs through all his books. He claims to have subtly woven this idea throughout his writing, but acknowledges that it remains undiscovered by critics. The narrator is intrigued and asks for a clue, but Vereker refuses to provide one, saying that the answer is already present in his work. Vereker's conversation with the narrator ends with a sense of challenge, as the narrator is determined to uncover the hidden meaning, while Vereker is confident that it will remain undiscovered.

Section section_04 (Chars 23318–31263):
Section Summary: The narrator becomes obsessed with uncovering the "general intention" or hidden meaning in Hugh Vereker's writing, but ultimately fails to find it and becomes disillusioned with his books. He shares his experience with George Corvick, who is intrigued and determined to uncover the secret, and plans to investigate further with his fiancée, Gwendolen. Vereker, learning that the narrator has shared his confidence, asks him to keep the matter private, fearing that it will spoil the fun of his game. The narrator visits Vereker to apologize for his indiscretion and learns that Vereker is not overly concerned, but rather amused by the situation. Corvick's pursuit of the secret, possibly aided by his impending marriage to Gwendolen, may ultimately lead to a breakthrough, but Vereker remains skeptical.

Section section_05 (Chars 31263–39010):
Section Summary: The narrator visited Vereker, who seemed indifferent to the topic of the hidden meaning in his work, and the narrator began to doubt its significance. The narrator then spoke to George Corvick, who was determined to uncover the meaning, along with his partner Gwendolen. Corvick and Gwendolen were enthusiastic about the challenge and planned to thoroughly analyze Vereker's work, page by page. The narrator was skeptical of their efforts, but Corvick was undeterred, convinced that he would eventually uncover the truth, and he preferred to work independently without direct communication with Vereker. The narrator observed that Corvick's pursuit of the hidden meaning had become an all-consuming passion, driven by his intellectual curiosity and his relationship with Gwendolen.

Section section_06 (Chars 39010–46999):
Section Summary: The narrator had lost touch with George Corvick, who had left England for India to work as a special commissioner for a provincial paper. Corvick's departure was a surprise, and the narrator inferred that he was motivated by a desire to make money, possibly to win over his former fiancée, Gwendolen Erme. However, Corvick had revealed that he was no longer engaged to Gwendolen, and the narrator suspected that she may have estranged him. Meanwhile, the narrator's curiosity about the hidden meaning in Vereker's works had been rekindled, and he was eager to learn if Corvick had made any progress in uncovering it. Gwendolen eventually shared news with the narrator that Corvick had sent a telegram from Bombay, claiming to have discovered Vereker's secret, and she was overjoyed, believing that he had finally uncovered the truth.

Eventually, Gwendolen receives a letter from Corvick, who has met with Vereker and is staying on to learn more, but he refuses to share the secret with her until they are married.

Section section_08 (Chars 54938–62816):
Section Summary: The narrator was unable to meet with George Corvick in England due to his brother's illness, which required him to travel to Germany and later to Meran. During this time, Corvick wrote to the narrator, asking him not to trouble him with questions about his work on a literary portrait of Hugh Vereker, a project that aimed to uncover the hidden meaning in Vereker's writings. Corvick's work was cut short when he died in a carriage accident on his honeymoon with Gwendolen, and the narrator later learned that the article was barely begun and did not reveal the secret. The narrator was left wondering if Gwendolen had gained knowledge of the hidden meaning, and he attempted to ask her about it in letters, but she remained reticent. The narrator's avidity for knowledge about Vereker's work remained unfulfilled, and he was left to ponder the mystery.

The narrator continues to try to uncover the secret, even after Mrs. Corvick publishes a new novel, "Overmastered", which does not contain the answer he is looking for. Meanwhile, Drayton Deane, a friend of Corvick's, becomes a presence in Mrs. Corvick's life and begins to review Vereker's work, including his latest book, "The Right of Way", which is published while Vereker is ill in Rome.

Section section_11 (Chars 78748–83271):
Section Summary: The narrator is trying to extract information about Hugh Vereker's secret, a general intention behind his books, from a man who was married to Mrs. Deane. However, the man claims he has no knowledge of the secret, which surprises the narrator as he assumed Mrs. Deane would have shared it with him. The narrator realizes that Mrs. Deane must not have thought her husband worthy of knowing the secret, which he finds strange given that she married him. The narrator shares his own story of trying to uncover Vereker's secret, and the man listens with growing attention and curiosity. The man's desire to know the secret is now ignited, and the narrator finds some consolation in the fact that they are both victims of unappeased desire.
