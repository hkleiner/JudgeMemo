You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of the site.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–16960):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and began to convert the Saxons to Christianity, with Ethelbert himself being baptized and the city of Canterbury becoming a center of Christian worship. The church of St. Martin's is believed to be one of the oldest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain, and it is thought to have been built on the site of a Roman church. Canterbury suffered various attacks, including a devastating raid by the Danes in 1011, but was rebuilt and restored by subsequent rulers, including the Danish king Canute and the Norman archbishop Lanfranc. The city's cathedral has undergone several transformations over the centuries, with the current Norman-style building replacing the original Saxon church in 1070.

Section section_03 (Chars 16961–25609):
Section Summary: To reach the altars in the cathedral, a crypt had to be ascended by several steps from the choir, a design feature that originated from the structural methods of Saxon times. The cathedral, a masterpiece of Norman architecture, was the site of a significant event in history - the murder of Archbishop Becket, which occurred 40 years after its construction. Becket had returned to Canterbury after six years of exile and was received with great enthusiasm, but his reunion was short-lived as four knights, sent by King Henry II, arrived with the intention of killing him. The knights, after a tense and confrontational meeting with Becket, ultimately carried out their plan, murdering the Archbishop during Vespers. This event would go on to make Canterbury a famous resort for pilgrims in Europe.

Section section_04 (Chars 25610–34486):
Section Summary: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was brutally murdered in the cathedral by knights in 1170. Despite not being universally admired in his lifetime, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, and his murder led to a massive influx of pilgrims to Canterbury. King Henry II, who had been implicated in the murder, performed a public penance at the cathedral in 1174, which helped to absolve him of his guilt. The cathedral became a major pilgrimage site, with wealth pouring in and pilgrims taking away vials of "martyr's blood" mixed with water. The cathedral suffered a fire in 1174, but was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman, resulting in the beautiful and iconic structure that stands today.

Section section_05 (Chars 34487–43014):
Section Summary: The north-western tower of Canterbury Cathedral, also known as the Arundel Tower, is the last remaining part of Lanfranc's original church and was rebuilt in 1840. The cathedral's central tower, commenced by Prior Molashe in 1433, is considered an external masterpiece. After reaching its peak, Canterbury began to decline, but its importance as a center of the English Church and its strategic location between England and France helped prevent it from decaying. The cathedral's architecture is a mix of Norman and Perpendicular styles, with various additions and modifications made over the centuries. The cathedral precincts include several notable features, such as the infirmary, treasury, and cloister, which showcase the city's rich history and architectural heritage.

Section section_06 (Chars 43015–51655):
Section Summary: The Cathedral's south walk and north transept are described, with a focus on the historic entrance and the beautiful south porch with its canopied niches. The vast nave is impressive, with a cool, greenish light, and is a magnificent vestibule to the crowded interest beyond the transept. The choir is unique, with elaborately devised eastern parts reconstructed by William of Sens and his English successor, and features richly carved foliated capitals and a profusion of carving. The Trinity Chapel, once home to the shrine of St. Thomas, is now an empty space, but still evokes a sense of history and significance, with notable features including the tomb of the Black Prince and the mosaic pavement. The chapel is also the final resting place of Henry IV and his wife, Joan of Navarre, with their effigies believed to be faithful representations.

Section section_07 (Chars 51656–60302):
Section Summary: The Cathedral of Canterbury contains several historic artifacts, including the shield, helmet, and sword sheath of the Black Prince, as well as a series of 13th-century stained glass windows depicting cures wrought at the Shrine of St. Thomas. The city of Canterbury is a walled city with a rich history, and although much of the wall has been destroyed, some sections and the West Gate still remain. The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, have survived despite past threats of destruction and desecration. St. Augustine's Abbey, founded by Augustine in 613, was once a prominent Benedictine monastery and has since been restored and repurposed as a missionary college. The nearby church of St. Martin, where Queen Bertha once worshipped, is also a historic site, although its antiquity may not be immediately apparent to casual observers.

Section section_08 (Chars 60303–62537):
Section Summary: To understand the historical significance of Canterbury's architecture, Canon Routledge's book is a valuable resource. Beyond the Cathedral, Abbey, and St. Martin's Church, the city has many more treasures to offer, including the Castle, old inns, and examples of early domestic architecture. The Castle's Norman keep, completed in 1125, still stands, although it is currently used as a storage facility. The city is also home to several historic hospitals and religious houses, such as the Hospital of St. Nicholas, a former leper colony. The section concludes by noting that historical events are part of a continuous process, with no clear beginnings or ends, and that the past and future are always interconnected.
