You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8282):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a "carnet rouge" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber and impressive sight.

Section section_02 (Chars 8283–16564):
Section Summary: The narrator visited the town of Barcy, which had been under fire for several days, and saw the damage caused by the war. They then traveled to Châlons, where they observed French officers on a train, noting their calm and composed demeanor despite being on their way to the front. The narrator was struck by the officers' strong nerves and ability to separate their emotions from their duties. In Châlons, the narrator had to obtain permission to stay in the town and was eventually allowed to do so after their papers were stamped. The town was quiet and gray, with many shops closed and a sense of stillness and oppression in the air.

Section section_03 (Chars 16564–24768):
Section Summary: The narrator arrived in Bar-le-Duc, a town near the front lines of World War I, and struggled to find the Hotel du Commerce, the "least bad" hotel in the area. After a long and dusty walk, they finally found the hotel, which was crowded with officers and had a dirty and run-down appearance. The narrator was treated dismissively by the young woman at the desk, but was able to have lunch in the crowded and fly-infested dining room. The town was subject to frequent air raids, and the narrator noticed the presence of stone cellars, or "caves," where people could take shelter during attacks. The narrator's experience in Bar-le-Duc was marked by a sense of discomfort and unease, reflecting the harsh realities of life in a war zone.

Section section_04 (Chars 24769–33018):
Section Summary: The narrator visited a town near the war zone and was struck by its desolate and run-down condition. They attempted to visit the Commissaire of Police and hospitals, but faced difficulties due to the lack of transportation, until they obtained an automobile from the military headquarters. With the help of a chauffeur, they visited two hospitals, Savonières and Hôpital Central, and were able to observe the town and its military activities. The narrator then waited at the train station, where they witnessed a chaotic scene with soldiers and a drunken Algerian soldier, but remained calm and unaffected due to the desensitizing atmosphere of the war zone. Ultimately, they found a way to wait for their train on the platform, despite initial refusal from a petty official, and waited anxiously as the hour of 5 approached, when bombs were likely to be dropped.

Section section_05 (Chars 33018–41476):
Section Summary: The narrator visited the War Office in Paris to arrange a trip to the war zone, but was told that a military automobile would only be provided if they were accompanied by an American Army officer. The narrator eventually set out on a four-day trip with Major C., Mme. Lyon, and their driver, Monsieur G. B., visiting various towns and hospitals in the war zone. Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, but the narrator was able to observe the daily life of soldiers in the war zone, including their leisure activities and training exercises. The narrator noted that the roads were in surprisingly good condition and that many soldiers seemed to be loafing, waiting to be called to the front. The trip provided the narrator with a unique perspective on the war zone, one that was different from what they would have experienced by train.

Section section_06 (Chars 41477–49923):
Section Summary: The author traveled through French villages, observing the effects of war on the people and landscape. Many villages were filled with soldiers on leave, while others were devoid of men, with women and children working in the fields. The author also witnessed the destruction of towns like Gerbéviller and Sermaize, which had been deliberately set on fire by retreating German forces. In Nancy, the author met women working on reconstruction efforts, including Princess Poniatowska, who aimed to raise funds to rebuild wrecked towns. The author argues that the ruins of these towns should be left intact as a testament to the horrors of war and a potential source of revenue for France through tourism.

Section section_07 (Chars 49924–58430):
Section Summary: The town of Gerbéviller was largely destroyed during the war, with only about 800 of its 2,000 inhabitants returning to live in cellars or a few remaining houses. The author visited the town and met Soeur Julie, a heroic nun who saved her hospice from destruction. The author also attempted to visit other towns, including Thann and Dugny, but was denied permission due to the danger of bombardment. Along the way, the author observed the daily life of the French people, including their conservative nature and the charm of the children, particularly a group of newsboys who approached her for pennies. The author's journey was marked by conversations with military officers, including Major C., who shared stories of his experiences at the front.

Section section_08 (Chars 58431–66631):
Section Summary: The narrator and others were at a Lieutenant's house in Epernay when a message was received from a German plane, criticizing the French for bombing civilian areas and threatening reprisals. The message claimed that the French government, influenced by the English, was responsible for these actions. The narrator then shifts to discussing a new organization, "Le Bienêtre du Blessé," a French-American society aimed at providing comfort and care to wounded soldiers. The organization, led by Mme. d'Andigné, aims to provide a more varied diet to convalescent soldiers, as the standard military hospital diet of milk and eggs is often not sufficient. The narrator, who had initially stumbled upon the organization's meeting, became enthusiastic about the cause and agreed to help promote it.

Section section_09 (Chars 66632–75072):
Section Summary: In the war zone of France, many hospitals lacked basic necessities like food and supplies, making it difficult to care for wounded soldiers. To address this issue, the Service de Santé asked Mme. d'Haussonville to establish a program to provide supplementary food and supplies to these hospitals through voluntary subscriptions. The program, known as Le Bienêtre du Blessé, aimed to provide delicacies like chicken broth, sugar, and preserves to boost the morale and aid the recovery of wounded soldiers. The author visited several hospitals in the war zone, including the Hôpital Central, and witnessed the dedication of the nurses and the impact of the supplementary supplies on the soldiers' well-being. The program helped to fill the gaps in the military's food supply, particularly outside of regular kitchen hours, and made a significant difference in the care of the wounded soldiers.

Section section_10 (Chars 75073–80827):
Section Summary: The author visits a base hospital in France and is impressed by the efforts of the infirmières to make the wards more pleasant for the wounded soldiers. The hospital's wards are decorated with palms, flowering shrubs, and pictures, which helps to boost the morale of the patients. The author notes that the French people, despite their own financial struggles, are grateful for the support of Americans and are doing their best to care for the wounded soldiers. Many wealthy French people have been financially drained by the war and are no longer able to support relief efforts on their own, making American donations crucial. The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the relief efforts, emphasizing the importance of helping those in need.
