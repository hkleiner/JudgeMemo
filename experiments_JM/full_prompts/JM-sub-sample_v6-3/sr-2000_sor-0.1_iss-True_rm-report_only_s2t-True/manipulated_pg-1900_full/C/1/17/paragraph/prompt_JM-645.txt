You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7881):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks for his help in writing a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for the periodical "The Middle". Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but later feels uncertain about its quality, especially after Corvick expresses his dissatisfaction with it. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, where Lady Jane praises the review and tries to get Vereker to read it, but he politely declines, taking the paper to read later. The narrator is left feeling anxious about Vereker's opinion of his review and unsure if he has truly understood the author's work.

Section section_02 (Chars 7881–16025):
Section Summary: The narrator mentions to Lady Jane that he is the author of a review, but her reaction is not as enthusiastic as he expected. At dinner, Vereker dismisses the review as "the usual twaddle", which hurts the narrator's feelings. However, later that night, Vereker approaches the narrator and explains that his harsh words were not intended to be hurtful, but rather a result of his frustration with critics constantly missing the point of his work. Vereker reveals that he feels like a failure because his "little point" is always misunderstood, even by clever critics like the narrator. The narrator is intrigued and eager to learn more about Vereker's elusive "little point".

Section section_03 (Chars 16025–23757):
Section Summary: The narrator is discussing with Vereker, an author, about the underlying theme or "secret" in his writings. Vereker hints that there is a particular idea or message that he has woven throughout his works, but refuses to explicitly state what it is. He suggests that the critic's job is to discover this secret, and that he has provided clues in every line and page of his writing. The narrator is determined to uncover the secret, but Vereker remains elusive, saying that his work speaks for itself and that he has already done his part in conveying the message. The conversation ends with Vereker encouraging the narrator to find the answer for himself, implying that the discovery will be a challenging but rewarding task.

Section section_04 (Chars 23757–31530):
Section Summary: The narrator had a conversation with a writer, Vereker, who hinted at a deeper meaning in his work, but refused to elaborate. The narrator shared this information with George Corvick, who became intensely interested and determined to uncover the hidden meaning. Corvick planned to investigate further, and the narrator warned Vereker that the information had been shared, but Vereker was not overly concerned. The narrator visited Vereker again, who advised him to "give it up" and seemed indifferent to the whole matter, but did reveal that the hidden meaning was a central part of his work. The narrator was left wondering about the true nature of Vereker's secret and whether Corvick would be able to uncover it.

Section section_05 (Chars 31530–39463):
Section Summary: The narrator's friends, Corvick and Gwendolen, became obsessed with uncovering the secret meaning in Vereker's works, and the narrator found their enthusiasm irritating. Corvick and Gwendolen spent their time re-reading Vereker's works, page by page, and discussing their findings, with Corvick determined to uncover the truth without any outside help. The narrator visited them occasionally, and Corvick shared his progress, but also his frustrations and disappointments, as he followed false leads and encountered setbacks. Corvick's determination and patience were admirable, but the narrator couldn't help feeling that he was on a wild goose chase. Meanwhile, Corvick's relationship with Gwendolen was progressing, but their plans for marriage were being delayed due to Corvick's obsession with Vereker's secret.

Section section_06 (Chars 39463–47397):
Section Summary: The narrator discusses Corvick's decision to take on a task that is not in his line of work, likely to make money and win over Gwendolen Erme, despite her mother's disapproval. However, Corvick reveals that he is no longer engaged to Gwendolen, and the narrator infers that she may have estranged him. Gwendolen later shares news that Corvick has discovered Vereker's secret idea, which she believes will bring him back to her. She is ecstatic and sends Corvick a cable urging him to write, but when they eventually hear from him, his message is tantalizingly vague, promising to reveal his discovery only after submitting it to Vereker. The narrator is left in suspense, awaiting Corvick's return and the revelation of Vereker's secret.

Section Summary: The narrator's friend Corvick had traveled to Rapallo to meet with the author Vereker, and the narrator was eagerly awaiting news from him. Corvick sent a telegram saying he had seen Vereker and everything was as expected, but he would be staying on for a month. The narrator later learned that Vereker had told Corvick's fiancée, Gwendolen, that he would reveal a secret to her after they were married. The narrator was surprised to hear that Gwendolen and Corvick were engaged, as Corvick had previously told him the opposite. The narrator was then forced to leave London due to his brother's illness, missing Corvick's return to England and feeling frustrated by the delay in learning Vereker's secret.

Before his death, Corvick had asked the narrator not to bother him with questions about the article, which was supposed to reveal a deep secret about Vereker's work. After Corvick's death, the narrator asked his widow, Gwendolen, if the article had been completed, but she replied that it was only a fragment and didn't reveal the secret. The narrator later asked Gwendolen if she had learned the secret from her husband, but she refused to answer, saying she would keep it to herself. This only added to the narrator's obsession with uncovering Vereker's secret, which became an all-consuming idea for him.

Section Summary: The narrator had hoped to learn Hugh Vereker's secret from his friend George Corvick's widow, but after she married Drayton Deane, he expected Deane to reveal the secret in his writing. However, Deane's articles and writings never mentioned Vereker's secret, leading the narrator to believe that Deane was either unable or unwilling to share it. The narrator eventually confronts Deane directly, offering to make a deal with him for the information, but Deane claims he doesn't know what the narrator is talking about and swears on his honor that his wife never told him Vereker's secret.
