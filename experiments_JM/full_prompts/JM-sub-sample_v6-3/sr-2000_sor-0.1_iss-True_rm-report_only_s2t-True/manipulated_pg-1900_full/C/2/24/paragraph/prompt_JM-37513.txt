You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8913):
Section Summary: The author's interest in science was sparked by reading Tyndall's "Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination" and was further developed by reading Herbert Spencer's works. Spencer's essay "Progress: its Law and Cause" introduced the author to the concept of evolution and the idea that progress is a universal law that applies to all aspects of existence, from the development of the Earth to the development of society and culture. The author was particularly drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, and that this principle is the underlying cause of progress. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the importance of biological relationships and the concept of differentiation, which he applied to various fields, including sociology, ethics, and psychology. The author notes that while Spencer's work has been influential, it also has limitations, particularly in its narrow focus on biological relationships and its failure to consider other, higher relationships.

Section section_02 (Chars 8914–17604):
Section Summary: Herbert Spencer's philosophy emphasized the concept of evolution as a universal principle, where all things grow and develop through natural processes. He believed in the universality of law, applying to both the physical and mental realms, and that everything can be explained in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, Spencer also acknowledged the existence of an "Unknowable" or "Ultimate Reality" that underlies all phenomena, which he saw as the source of all force and causation. This concept is central to his philosophy, but its ambiguity and vagueness have led to criticism and confusion. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy seeks to provide a unified and comprehensive understanding of the world, but its attempt to explain the ultimate source of all phenomena sets it apart from the more limited scope of scientific inquiry.

Section section_03 (Chars 17605–26158):
Section Summary: The section discusses the philosophical ideas of Herbert Spencer and his critic, M. Bergson, on the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge. Spencer distinguishes between the knowable effects of natural phenomena and their unknowable cause or source, which he calls the Unknowable. Bergson, on the other hand, draws a distinction between "the evolved" and "evolution itself," with Life being the agency that drives evolution. Both thinkers agree that the intellect can only provide a world of symbols, and that the ultimate reality or source of phenomena can only be known through intuition. The section also touches on Spencer's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, and the notion of power or agency that underlies all phenomena.

Section section_04 (Chars 26159–34845):
Section Summary: The concept of "cause" is ambiguous and has been criticized by philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and Professor Mach, who suggest that it should be discarded from the philosophical vocabulary. In science, the term "cause" can be replaced with "effective" to describe the relatedness of things that implies certain changes. The concept of energy is also reevaluated, with some arguing that it is not an active agent, but rather a constant ratio of variables that describes changes in a field of relatedness. The author suggests that the word "Source" be used instead of "cause" to avoid ambiguity, and that the term "force" be used to describe a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness. Ultimately, the goal is to understand clearly what these terms mean and to avoid misleading associations.

Section section_05 (Chars 34846–44120):
Section Summary: The author discusses the distinction between events and states, and how this distinction can be applied to understanding the concept of cause and effect. The author suggests using the terms "ground", "condition", and "source" to clarify the different types of relationships between things, rather than relying on the ambiguous term "cause". The author criticizes Spencer's philosophy for lacking a thorough analysis of the different types of relatedness in nature, and for relying on overly broad terms like "differentiation" and "integration". The author argues that a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between things is necessary to truly understand the natural world and the process of evolution. By making these distinctions, the author aims to provide a clearer and more precise framework for understanding the complex relationships within the natural world.

Section section_06 (Chars 44121–53200):
Section Summary: The properties of pre-existing molecules allow them to become part of a crystal's structure, but it's difficult to say that the specific modes of relatedness within the crystal existed before the crystal itself. The author identifies three main types of relatedness: physico-chemical, vital, and cognitive, each with its own evolution and new properties that emerge at higher stages. These new properties are not just the sum of their parts, but are constitutive and characteristic of the higher evolutionary products. The author argues that relationships are just as real as the things they relate, and that new modes of relatedness and properties appear in the course of evolutionary progress. Ultimately, the author suggests that a provisional unification of scientific knowledge can be achieved through a hierarchy of logical implication, where higher modes of relatedness imply lower ones.

Section section_07 (Chars 53201–62356):
Section Summary: Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science aims to establish a correlation between cognitive processes and physiological processes, and ultimately with physico-chemical processes. However, Spencer later recognized the limitations of a purely mechanical interpretation of nature, acknowledging the presence of specific vital characters in living organisms that cannot be explained in physico-chemical terms. Spencer's view of cognition emphasizes the complex relationship between the organism and the environment, but his terminology and distinctions between internal and external relations are sometimes ambiguous. A truly scientific interpretation of cognitive relatedness is still lacking, and Spencer's work does not provide an adequate analysis of this complex problem. Ultimately, a scientific philosophy must deal with cognitive relatedness in a strictly analogous manner to other relational problems, without resorting to unscientific concepts like psychic entities or vital forces.

Section section_08 (Chars 62357–71136):
Section Summary: The author discusses the concept of "knowing" in a broad sense, including physiological and physical processes, and how they are related to each other. The author argues that there are different modes of relatedness, including physico-chemical, vital, and cognitive, which are dependent on each other and imply a chain of heredity-relationships. The author also explores the concept of awareness, questioning whether it is present in physiological and physical processes, and notes that awareness is a characteristic feature of cognitive knowledge. Additionally, the author discusses the relationship between cognitive processes and underlying physiological processes, including the role of the cortex and the concept of psycho-physical parallelism. Ultimately, the author aims to understand cognition as a natural kind of relatedness that can be studied scientifically.

Section section_09 (Chars 71137–80094):
Section Summary: The author discusses the relationship between cognitive processes and physiological processes, arguing that they are correlated but not separate entities. The concept of parallelism is rejected, as it implies two separate orders of being, and instead, the author suggests that cognitive processes imply underlying physiological changes. The author also critiques the idea of dualism, suggesting that it is not helpful for scientific interpretation, and instead proposes a more modest hypothesis that cognition always implies certain physiological processes. The author emphasizes that cognitive relatedness is effective, meaning that it can bring about changes in the system, and that it is not merely an epiphenomenal accompaniment to physical processes. Ultimately, the author argues that a scientific approach to understanding cognition and consciousness is needed, one that treats these phenomena as part of the natural order of things.
