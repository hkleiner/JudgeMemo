You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8217):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than just collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary knowledge, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen but are actually just pretentious collectors, while others, like the quiet men who read classic literature in their free time, are true bookmen without realizing it. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular literature and timeless, meaningful works.

Section Summary: The writer describes a bookman who values literature that stands the test of time and has a lasting impact on the human mind.

The bookman has a diverse taste in literature, enjoying works by authors such as Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey, and appreciates the essay as a particularly delightful form of literature. He is not concerned with the respectability of the writer or the accuracy of the information, but rather with the writer's ability to convey their thoughts and experiences in a vivid and engaging way. The bookman's love affair with literature begins with classic novels like "Robinson Crusoe" and "Pilgrim's Progress", which remain dear to him throughout his life.

Section section_05 (Chars 32385–40748):
Section Summary: The author reflects on the allure of books and the disease of bibliomania, which can be hereditary and incurable. A book lover's passion for collecting rare and beautiful books can lead to financial struggles and neglect of family responsibilities. The author draws a parallel between bibliomania and dipsomania, suggesting that the only cure for a bookman is total abstinence from buying rare books. Despite the best intentions, a bookman may struggle to resist the temptation of buying more books, often leading to clever attempts to hide new purchases from their spouse. Ultimately, the author portrays the bookman's wife as the sufferer and good angel, trying to intervene and save her family from the consequences of her husband's obsession.
