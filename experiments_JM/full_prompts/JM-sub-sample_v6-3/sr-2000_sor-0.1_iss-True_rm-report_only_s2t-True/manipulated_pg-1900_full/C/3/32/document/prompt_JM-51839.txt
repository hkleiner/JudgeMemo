You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8329):
Section Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians, who settled in the area and built homes around ceremonial mounds. According to legend, the city was founded by Nacogdoches, a twin son of a Caddo chief, who was instructed to travel towards the setting sun and establish a home. The area was later visited by European explorers, including De Soto and LaSalle, and was eventually settled by Spanish missionaries, who established the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches in 1716. The city was abandoned and refounded several times, with the modern city dating back to 1779, when Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo and his followers established a civic corporation. Today, remnants of the city's ancient past can still be seen, including a remaining mound on which a 200-year-old oak tree grows.

Section section_02 (Chars 8330–16582):
Section Summary: Nacogdoches was a Spanish town in the early 19th century, and its residents played a role in suppressing Philip Nolan's expedition, which was backed by Aaron Burr and General James Wilkinson. The town was later involved in the Mexican Revolution against Spain, with many of its residents joining the Magee-Gutierrez expedition to drive out the Spanish military forces. After the Spanish forces were defeated, the town was swept by the Spanish army and its inhabitants were forced to flee to American territory. In 1819, Dr. James Long led an expedition to Nacogdoches, occupying the Old Stone Fort and declaring the establishment of the Republic of Texas, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The town's history during this period was marked by political upheaval, military conflicts, and the involvement of various figures, including Stephen F. Austin and Erasmo Seguin.

Section section_03 (Chars 16582–25230):
Section Summary: In 1819, James Long's attempt to free Texas from Mexican rule ended in failure, and he and his wife fled to the United States. The town of Nacogdoches regained its prestige under the leadership of Alcalde James Dill, but tensions rose between American and Mexican settlers, leading to the Fredonian War in 1826. The war resulted in the expulsion of several prominent citizens, but the town was eventually pacified with the help of Stephen F. Austin. The Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution, as American settlers defeated the Mexican army and expelled them from the territory east of the Neches River. Following the battle, Nacogdoches became increasingly American in character, with American customs and merchants prevailing over Mexican influences.

Section section_04 (Chars 25231–33950):
Section Summary: The town of Nacogdoches experienced a period of growth and prosperity, with an increasing population and thriving business, despite being surrounded by a larger Indian population. However, the Mexican dictator Santa Anna's overthrow of the constitution led to rising tensions and the formation of a "war party" that advocated for resistance. Nacogdoches played a significant role in the Texas Revolution, with many of its citizens, including Sam Houston and General Thomas J. Rusk, holding key positions in the new government. After the revolution, the town continued to grow, with new towns and businesses emerging, but its importance eventually declined as new centers of trade and agriculture sprang up in other parts of Texas. The town's citizens, including many prominent leaders, eventually moved to other areas, seeking new opportunities and easier access to land and resources.

Section section_05 (Chars 33950–42464):
Section Summary: After being annexed by the United States, Nacogdoches settled into a flourishing town, losing its preeminence in politics and social matters. The town remained an important social center, with a strong culture and refined taste in literary and scholastic affairs, and was home to several schools and institutions of learning. However, the town suffered greatly during the Civil War, with many of its businesses and institutions destroyed, and it took decades for it to recover. The arrival of the railroad in the late 19th century brought new business and growth to the town, and it eventually became a thriving city. Today, Nacogdoches is a charming city with a rich history, having been under nine different flags throughout its existence.

Section Summary: The Old Stone Fort in Nacogdoches was sold under execution to Rebecca Fenley in 1830 and later torn down, with its materials used to build the Stone Fort Memorial and eventually the present-day replica on the Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College campus. In 1716, three missions and a presidio were established in the area under the direction of Captain Don Domingo Ramon, but they were later abandoned or relocated.
