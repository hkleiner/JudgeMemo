You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8908):
Section Summary: The author recounts how they became a teacher by chance, without a clear aspiration or preparation, and how this was a common experience among their peers. The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who treated it as a mere job and another who approached it as a profession, taking initiative and showing enthusiasm for improving education. The second young man's dedication and attention to detail, such as ensuring proper seating arrangements, led to his success and eventual promotion to a leadership role. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with personality being a key factor in inspiring and motivating students. By sharing these experiences, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession, and the impact it can have on one's career and students.

To be successful, teachers should be careful when filling out application blanks, choose responsible references, and be honest about their qualifications and motivations. A superintendent's role is not only to lead the school but also to support and encourage their teachers' professional growth. Before starting a new position, it's essential to prepare and get acquainted with the school situation, as the author did by visiting their new town and meeting with the outgoing superintendent and board members. By being proactive and diligent, a superintendent can set themselves up for success and create a positive and efficient school environment.

Section section_05 (Chars 37143–46487):
Section Summary: The school has two types of activities: minor and major. Minor activities, such as clubs, meet informally and require little effort from teachers, while major activities, like sports and school events, are more formal and demanding. These activities help to socialize the school, develop school pride, and teach students to work together towards a common goal. However, they can also be overdone and interfere with academic work, requiring proper direction and management from teachers and the public. Overall, these activities are essential to a vibrant school community, but need to be balanced with academic responsibilities.

Section section_06 (Chars 46488–55456):
Section Summary: The narrator, a superintendent, formed a positive working relationship with the school janitor by showing willingness to cooperate and help with tasks. The janitor initially was hesitant but eventually came to respect the narrator and even received a salary raise due to his improved performance. The narrator believes that this experience illustrates the importance of treating support staff as coworkers rather than subordinates. A survey of teachers in the city schools revealed that they value assistance from principals in areas such as supporting exceptional children, interpreting the course of study, and providing administrative support. The survey also highlighted the need for principals to provide constructive criticism, emotional support, and a well-planned work environment to help teachers succeed.

Section Summary: Teachers often lose confidence in their methods due to unrealistic expectations, but with moderation and sense, many methods can be excellent. Principals can provide professional leadership by offering concrete help, interpreting the course of study, and giving teachers opportunities for growth and recognition. Effective administration, such as furnishing supplies and equipment on time and providing definite directions, can also support teachers. Additionally, principals can build strong relationships with teachers by showing genuine interest and appreciation for their work, which can lead to a more positive and productive school environment. By doing so, principals can help teachers feel valued and encouraged, leading to better outcomes for students.

Section section_08 (Chars 64811–70094):
Section Summary: Helping students choose the right vocation is a major challenge for homes and schools. To address this, schools are implementing vocational guidance programs, trade schools, and part-time schools to prepare students for their future careers. Some schools are using club organizations and guest speakers to provide students with information about different professions and help them make informed decisions. Many parents and community members are unaware of the resources and opportunities available in schools, leading to misconceptions about the value of education. By working together, schools can help students adjust to a vocation and prepare them for success in life.
