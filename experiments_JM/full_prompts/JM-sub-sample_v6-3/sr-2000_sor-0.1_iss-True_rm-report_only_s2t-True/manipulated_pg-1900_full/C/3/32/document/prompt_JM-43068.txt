You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8850):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. Millet's style is influenced by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a 16th-century painter who is now recognized as a great master of peasant painting. Unlike Brueghel's contemporaries, such as Adrian Brouwer and Jan Steen, Millet's work is marked by a more subdued and melancholic tone, reflecting the changing times and the struggles of the French peasant. Millet's paintings, such as "The Angelus," are not sentimental but rather a truthful and earnest depiction of peasant life, conveying the importance of religion and the struggle for existence. Overall, Millet's unique style and approach to painting have secured his place as a significant figure in the world of art.

Section Summary: Jean-François Millet was a philosopher-artist who focused on conveying the struggles and simplicity of peasant life. His artwork often featured lonely, laborious scenes, such as "The Sheep Pen" and "The Sower", which highlighted the monotony and importance of rural work.

He was particularly inspired by the spring season and the themes of hard work, duty, and the cycle of life. Millet's unique approach to art, prioritizing meaning over technical brilliance, sets him apart from other painters and makes his work enduring and thought-provoking.

Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, making it difficult for innovative artists to break through.

His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing significant roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family encouraged his artistic pursuits. He eventually began to develop his skills as an artist, laying the foundation for his future success, before making the decision to leave for Paris to pursue his artistic career.

Section section_04 (Chars 26478–35291):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father recognized his son's artistic talent and took him to meet a painter in Cherbourg, where he began to study art. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm to manage it, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue his artistic passion, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to support his move to Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre and developed his own unique style. However, his time in Paris was not without challenges, and he struggled to find his place in the art world, even briefly studying with the unsuitable Delaroche. Ultimately, Millet was freed to pursue his own artistic vision, despite the difficulties of poverty and the dominant artistic styles of the time.
