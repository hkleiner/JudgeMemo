You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7853):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks him to review a new novel by Hugh Vereker, a renowned author, for the periodical "The Middle". The narrator is eager to read the novel and write the review, especially since he will be meeting Vereker at a social gathering. Corvick warns the narrator not to simply praise Vereker as "awfully clever", but to try to truly understand and critique his work. The narrator writes the review, but later feels uncertain about its quality, especially after Corvick expresses disappointment with it. The narrator meets Vereker at the social gathering, but doesn't get a chance to discuss the review with him, although Lady Jane eventually brings it up and praises the narrator's work.

Section section_02 (Chars 7853–15628):
Section Summary: The narrator's review of Hugh Vereker's book was praised by Lady Jane, but when Vereker himself commented on it, he called it "the usual twaddle", which hurt the narrator's feelings. However, later that evening, Vereker approached the narrator and apologized for his earlier comment, explaining that he had been misunderstood. Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the true point of his work. He confided in the narrator, sharing his feelings of being a failure despite his success, and the two connected over their shared love of literature. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kindness and sincerity, and his initial hurt was replaced by a deeper understanding and appreciation of the author.

Section section_03 (Chars 15628–23325):
Section Summary: The narrator is having a conversation with Vereker, an author, about a "little point" that Vereker has written his books for. Vereker describes it as the central idea or passion that drives his writing, but refuses to explicitly state what it is, instead saying that it is palpable throughout his work. The narrator is fascinated and determined to discover the secret, but Vereker is coy and only provides vague hints, suggesting that it is something that can be found in the style, thought, or language of his writing. Vereker believes that critics should be able to discover the secret on their own, and that it is their job to do so. The narrator is left to ponder the mystery, determined to figure it out and announce his discovery in an article.

Section section_04 (Chars 23325–31274):
Section Summary: The narrator becomes obsessed with uncovering the "general intention" or hidden meaning in Hugh Vereker's writing, but ultimately fails to find it and becomes disillusioned with his books. He shares his experience with George Corvick, who becomes intrigued and determined to uncover the secret. Vereker, however, regrets having shared his secret and asks the narrator to keep it confidential, fearing that it will spoil the fun of his writing. The narrator warns Vereker that Corvick has already been told and may share it with his fiancée, Gwendolen, but Vereker is not overly concerned. Corvick's pursuit of the secret, driven by his admiration for Vereker and his love for Gwendolen, may potentially lead to a breakthrough, but Vereker remains skeptical.

Section section_05 (Chars 31274–39017):
Section Summary: The narrator visited a man who had been cryptic about a secret in his writing, and although the man was good-natured, the narrator sensed that he was unstable and prone to mood swings. The narrator shared his experience with George Corvick, who was determined to uncover the secret, along with his partner Gwendolen. Corvick and Gwendolen were deeply invested in the mystery and spent their time re-reading the author's works, page by page, in search of clues. The narrator was skeptical of their efforts, but Corvick was undeterred, convinced that the author had hidden a deeper meaning in his writing. As the narrator observed Corvick and Gwendolen's pursuit, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease and expectation that something would eventually be revealed.

Section Summary: The narrator had lost touch with George Corvick, who had left England for a writing assignment, and was surprised to learn that Corvick had cracked the code to understanding Vereker's writing. Corvick had sent a telegram from Bombay with the message "Eureka. Immense", indicating that he had discovered Vereker's secret. The narrator was excited by the news, but also curious about how Corvick had made the discovery, especially since he had been away from the books for six months. Gwendolen Erme, who was also searching for the answer, was overjoyed by the news and believed that Corvick's discovery was genuine. The narrator and Gwendolen were eager to learn more about Corvick's discovery and awaited his written explanation.

Section Summary: The narrator was unable to meet with George Corvick in England due to his brother's illness, which required him to travel to Munich and later Meran. During this time, Corvick began working on a literary portrait of Hugh Vereker, but before he could finish, he married Gwendolen after the sudden death of her mother, Mrs. Erme. Tragically, Corvick died in an accident on his honeymoon, leaving behind only a fragment of his article on Vereker. The narrator, eager to know if Corvick had uncovered the secret to Vereker's writing, asked Gwendolen if her husband had finished the article, but she replied that it was barely begun and didn't reveal the truth.

The narrator begins to speculate that the secret might only be shared between lovers or spouses, and even considers the possibility of marrying Mrs. Corvick to gain access to the information. However, she ultimately rejects his advances and tells him that the secret is "her life," and that he has insulted the dead by pursuing it. Meanwhile, Drayton Deane, a friend of Corvick's, becomes acquainted with Mrs. Corvick and begins to review Vereker's work, further complicating the narrator's quest for the secret.

Section Summary: The narrator is trying to extract information about Hugh Vereker's secret, a general intention behind his books, from a man who was married to Mrs. Deane. However, the man claims he has no knowledge of such a secret, despite the narrator's assumption that his wife would have shared it with him. The narrator is shocked and disappointed, realizing that Mrs. Deane must not have thought her husband worthy of trusting with the information. The narrator then shares his own story of trying to uncover Vereker's secret, and the man listens with growing attention and curiosity. The man's desire to know the secret is now ignited, and the narrator finds some consolation in the fact that they are both victims of unappeased desire.
