You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8338):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city in the west over a thousand years ago and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, which was collected by an officer stationed in the area.

The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and dairy products, with meat being a rare luxury. They appear to be a poor and relatively inactive people, with a lack of energy and no traditional sports or games, and their economic condition is low, but not extremely poor. The physical characteristics of the Sarö Yögurs include prominent cheekbones, short and broad faces, and small eyes, with some individuals having distinctive nose shapes.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people are described as being of average height with black hair and thin beards, and are known for their slow movements except when it comes to buying and selling. Their customs include burning the dead on a bier, inheriting property through the wife, and practicing monogamy, with divorce sometimes permitted. Weddings are the only festive occasions observed by the Sarö Yögurs, and are marked by the bride being given a dowry and the couple being led to their new home by a lama. The Sarö Yögurs also have unique childbirth and death customs, and their language has been influenced by Chinese, with some words being substituted with Chinese equivalents. The author notes that the tribe's population has been decimated by unfavorable conditions, with deaths outnumbering births, although the accuracy of the statistical account is uncertain.

Section section_04 (Chars 24843–33005):
Section Summary: The author set out on an excursion to visit the Shera Yögur Prince, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, who rode a small pony that kept pace with the author's larger horse. They traveled through a barren landscape with poor soil and coarse grass, and the author noted the lack of energy and manliness among the Turkish tribe they encountered. The author later prepared to visit the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'anglungssu, was delayed due to the late arrival of the escort, but they eventually set out and traversed a challenging terrain of ravines, icy rivers, and rocky hills. The monastery, also known as Rtangu rgonba, was a collection of buildings with a large, colorful temple at its center, surrounded by dozens of humble houses.

Section section_05 (Chars 33006–41243):
Section Summary: The author visited a monastery in K'anglungssu, where they observed the local architecture, daily life, and religious practices of the lamas. The temple was a large, wealthy building with Tibetan influences, featuring Buddhist pictures, banners, and statues, including a bronze statue of a prominent figure. The lamas, who numbered around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The monastery's gegen, or Great Lama, was a child living in the mountains, and the lamas were supported by voluntary contributions for their services as prayer-readers. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and taking in the scenic surroundings of the Kiito-gol valley.

Section Summary: The author describes the lamas and their traditional clothing, as well as the landscape and geography of the region, including the mountains, valleys, and rivers. The Shera Yögurs, a Mongolian tribe, inhabit the area and are governed by hereditary leaders called t'umus, who act as judges and manage the tribe's affairs. The tribe has a limited knowledge of their origin, but it is believed that they migrated to the area during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects. The author notes that the tribe has a unique culture and language, and that they consider themselves to be related to the Sarö Yögurs, despite linguistic differences. The tribe's history and traditions are largely oral, with little written documentation, although the author was able to obtain a historical document granting the tribe permission to graze on certain pasture lands.

Section section_07 (Chars 49251–56899):
Section Summary: The Shera Yögurs and Sarö Yögurs are remnants of a tribe that was sent to a desolate area by the Chinese government, where they were provided with cattle. The tribe has greatly diminished due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element, with women outnumbering men and many families having few or no children. The Shera Yögurs are divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The tribe has unique customs, including leaving the dead to be eaten by birds of prey and arranging marriages between families, with the bride being "bought" and the price paid in livestock. The wedding ceremony involves a procession, feasting, and gift-giving, and is an important occasion for the tribe, with the newly married couple visiting the bride's parents on the third day.

The river led them to the Chinese town of Li-yen, also known as "the garden of pear trees", which was surrounded by picturesque hills and willow trees. The author was warmly received by the friendly old mandarin, who sent them a delicious dinner and showed them great courtesy. The author eventually departed Li-yen and rode to Kanchenp'u and then Kanchow, following the same road they had taken earlier.
