You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8195):
Section Summary: The author describes the difficulty of entering the war zone in France, known as the Zone des Armées, which is strictly controlled by the military. To gain access, the author seeks help from influential people, including a duchess who has established hospitals near the front lines. After a month of waiting, the author finally receives a carnet rouge, a permit that allows her to visit certain areas, but is initially only granted permission to visit Meaux and Rouen, which are not her desired destinations. She persuades the officials to consider other locations, including Bar-le-Duc, Verdun, and Nancy, but is warned that some of these areas may be too dangerous for an American lady. The author eventually visits Meaux with a French friend, where they witness the devastating aftermath of the Battle of the Marne, including vast fields of graves marked by flags and crosses.

Section section_02 (Chars 8196–16466):
Section Summary: The author visited the village of Barcy, which had been under fire for several days, and saw the damage caused by the war. The author was then given permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and took a train to Châlons, where they observed French officers who were calm and unemotional despite being on their way to the front. The author was struck by the officers' strong nerves and ability to compartmentalize their emotions, which they believed was a key factor in the French resistance to the war. Upon arriving in Châlons, the author had to navigate bureaucratic procedures to obtain permission to stay in the town, but was eventually able to do so after producing the necessary documents and letters of introduction. The author's experiences in Châlons were marked by a sense of quiet and stillness, with many shops and buildings closed due to the war.

Section Summary: The author arrived in a war town and found it to be gray, silent, and shuttered, with little evidence of life except for hundreds of army wagons. They spent the day reading a Dumas novel, "Le Collier de la Reine", in their hotel room, as there was nothing else to do in the town. The next day, the author traveled to Bar-le-Duc, where they saw more signs of war, including crosses in the wheat fields and ruins in the town of Révigny. Upon arriving in Bar-le-Duc, the author had difficulty finding the Hotel du Commerce and was eventually directed to it by a local. The hotel was dirty and crowded with officers, and the author was treated with indifference by the staff, but managed to have a meal in the dining room.

Section Summary: The narrator visited a hotel in Bar-le-Duc, where they were served a poor meal in unhygienic conditions, and decided to leave as soon as possible.

With the help of a chauffeur, the narrator visited two hospitals, Savonières and another, and was able to complete their task efficiently. Afterward, they waited at the train station, where they witnessed a disturbing scene with a drunken Algerian soldier, but remained calm due to the desensitizing effect of being in a war zone. The narrator eventually waited for their train on the platform, despite initial refusal from a petty official, and was able to depart from Bar-le-Duc.

Section Summary: The author, a woman, was determined to visit the war zone despite the French authorities' initial reluctance to allow her to go. She eventually obtained permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter asking the military authorities to show her every civility. On her train journey to Châlons, she observed the French officers, noting their height, erect posture, and calm demeanor, which she attributed to their strong nerves and ability to compartmentalize their emotions. The author arrived in Châlons, a gray and quiet town with a sense of oppressive stillness, and checked into a hotel called "Haute-Mère-Dieu".

Section Summary: The author met Miss Polk and Miss Ethel Crocker in Nancy, who are working with Princess Poniatowska on a project to rebuild war-torn towns in France.

The group later visited the Lieutenant's home in Epernay, where they were shown a propaganda leaflet dropped by a German plane, which contained false and self-righteous claims about the French and English. The narrator and her companions were struck by the absurdity and danger of the German mindset, and they witnessed a military train passing by, carrying soldiers to the Somme.

Section section_12 (Chars 91129–99345):
Section Summary: A French-American society, "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", was formed to provide comfort and well-being to wounded soldiers in military hospitals. The society, led by Mme. d'Andigné, aims to supply hospitals with delicacies such as chicken broth, fruits, and preserves, which are not provided by the military dietary kitchen. These items are essential for the recovery of wounded soldiers, who often have sensitive stomachs and cannot tolerate the standard military diet of milk and eggs. The society relies on voluntary subscriptions and donations to fund its efforts, and its work is crucial in boosting the morale and aiding the recovery of soldiers in the war zone. By providing these essential items, the society hopes to make a significant difference in the lives of wounded soldiers and support their recovery.
