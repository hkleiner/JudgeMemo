You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings.

The couple then decides to follow a man wearing a uniform with a badge that appears to be related to the Home for Lost Dogs, in the hopes that he will lead them to their destination. As they try to follow him discreetly, they find themselves in a series of awkward and humorous situations.

Later, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a loyal and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and developing into a unique-looking dog.

He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then can't remember where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic scene. Excalibur's daily walks are also marked by his attempts to make friends with other dogs, which are often unsuccessful, and his visits to a rabbit and various village shops, where he is treated with kindness and given treats.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various shopkeepers and animals. Eileen had attempted to teach Excalibur tricks, but he was not very successful and often got into trouble. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, and made a mess, but Eileen's charm and apology quickly won over the curate. The curate and Eileen struck up a conversation, and Excalibur became a regular chaperone for their interactions, including tennis games on the lawn. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself overworked in his new role, but he tolerated the disruptions to his usual routine with his usual good nature.

The curate revealed that he had limited financial means and felt they could not afford to marry, leading to a decision that he would have to leave for London to find work and build a future for them.
