You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section Summary: The author developed a love for Caslon typeface and Old English Text, known as Caslon Black, during his early days as a printer. In 1895, he visited a collection of books printed in New England during the Colonial period and gained knowledge of Caslon's noble ancestry, which further sparked his interest. This experience influenced his typographic style, and he became a member of the Arts and Crafts society, contributing to their first exhibition. The author's use of Caslon typeface was initially met with criticism, but it eventually gained popularity, and he went on to establish the Wayside Press, where he printed his first project, a Strathmore deckle-edge sample book. The press was established in a new loft building, and the author's goal was to produce high-quality publications, including his art and literary magazine, Bradley: His Book.

Section section_06 (Chars 42245–50921):
Section Summary: The author was initially hesitant to take on a commission, but was won over by the possibilities of printing on Strathmore papers with Caslon type. The combination proved popular, and the author's printing business, the Wayside Press, grew rapidly, necessitating a move to a larger space and the addition of new equipment and staff. However, the author soon found himself overwhelmed and struggling to manage the business, leading to a breakdown and the eventual closure of the Wayside Press. The author then moved to New York, where he attempted to start a new magazine and sought out the writer Richard Harding Davis, who agreed to write a story for the magazine without expecting payment.

The book about Bradley's life and work was assembled from separate papers he wrote between 1949 and 1951, with some editing to create a continuous narrative. The project was a cooperative effort, with significant contributions from Peter Beilenson, who helped with design, printing, and editing. Despite his advanced age, Bradley offered to develop the typographic plan and rewrite the text, but his original recollections were deemed sufficient to reflect his remarkable career.
