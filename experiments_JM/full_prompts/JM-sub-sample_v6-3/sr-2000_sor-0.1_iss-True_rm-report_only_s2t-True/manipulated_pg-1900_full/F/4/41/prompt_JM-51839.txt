You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7996):
Section Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians, who settled in the area and built homes around ceremonial mounds. According to legend, the city was founded by a Caddo chief's twin sons, Natchitoches and Nacogdoches, who were instructed to build their homes and rear their tribes in different locations. The area was later visited by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle, and was also influenced by the Christian teachings of Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda. The first permanent European settlement in Nacogdoches was established in 1716 by Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus, who founded the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches. The city has since been shaped by the interactions of Native American, Spanish, and French cultures, with many historical landmarks and traditions still present today.

Section section_02 (Chars 7996–16137):
Section Summary: The city of Nacogdoches was established in the late 18th century by Gil Ybarbo, a Spanish lieutenant governor, who built the "Old Stone Fort" as a commissary for military and commercial supplies. The town grew rapidly and became a key location in the region, with Ybarbo ruling as a benevolent despot until his removal from office in 1792. In the early 19th century, Nacogdoches was involved in several significant events, including the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition and the Mexican Revolution against Spain. The town was also a hub for various expeditions and schemes, including the formation of the Republic of Texas, led by Dr. James Long in 1819. During this time, Nacogdoches was a center of activity, with multiple newspapers being published and various factions vying for control of the region.

Section section_03 (Chars 16138–24627):
Section Summary: Dr. Long's expedition to free Texas in 1819 failed due to the royalists being in control of Mexico and the division of his forces. After the failure, Nacogdoches regained its prestige under the leadership of Alcalde James Dill, and American settlers began to arrive under the new Mexican government's colonization laws. However, tensions rose between the Americans and Mexicans, leading to the Fredonian War in 1826, which resulted in the expulsion of prominent citizens from the town. The Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution, as American settlers defeated the Mexican troops, leading to their expulsion from the territory east of San Antonio. This battle paved the way for the growth of American influence in Nacogdoches, which became increasingly American in character.

Section section_04 (Chars 24628–33190):
Section Summary: In 1834, the neighboring municipality of San Augustine was organized, and Nacogdoches continued to grow in numbers and influence. However, the town's prosperity was disrupted by political troubles in the Mexican republic, leading to the Texas Revolution, which Nacogdoches helped finance and support. After the revolution, the town experienced a period of expansion, with the establishment of new towns and the growth of commerce. Despite some remaining conflicts, including the Cordova Rebellion, Nacogdoches became a hub for prominent leaders of Texas, including Sam Houston and General Thomas J. Rusk. The town's influence extended to the public affairs of the country, with many of its citizens playing important roles in the new republic.

Section section_05 (Chars 33190–41684):
Section Summary: Nacogdoches, a city in Texas, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century, with various prominent figures contributing to its development. The city played a significant role in opening up the northern regions of Texas, but its population and importance declined as new centers of trade and agriculture emerged. Despite this, Nacogdoches remained a social and cultural hub, with a strong emphasis on education and learning, and was home to the University of Nacogdoches, established in 1845. The city suffered during the Civil War, but experienced a resurgence with the arrival of the railroad and the establishment of new businesses and institutions, including Stephen F. Austin State University. The Old Stone Fort, a historic building in Nacogdoches, has a fascinating history, having served as a trading post, government headquarters, and home to various notable figures, and has been a witness to many significant events in Texas history.
