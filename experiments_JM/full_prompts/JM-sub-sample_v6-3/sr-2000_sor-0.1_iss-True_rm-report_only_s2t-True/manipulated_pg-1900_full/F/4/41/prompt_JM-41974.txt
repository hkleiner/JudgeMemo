You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8112):
Section Summary: Paolo Veronese, born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, was a great painter known for his unique blend of absurdity and adorability. He was trained by his uncle, Antonio Badile, and developed his skills through diligent practice and study of masters like Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden. Veronese's early works already showed promise, and he quickly gained recognition in Verona and beyond, including a commission from Cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga to paint a picture for the cathedral at Mantua. He outshone his competitors and gained preference, but soon found that his native city was too limited for his ambitions, leading him to leave Verona with his friend Battista Zelotti to pursue greater opportunities. Veronese's love for Venice, where he later settled, would become a defining feature of his work, as he glorified the city and its vibrant culture through his magnificent use of color and expression.

In Venice, Veronese was exposed to the works of great Venetian masters, including Titian, Tintoretto, and Giorgione, but he managed to maintain his unique style and vision. He became known for his vibrant and joyful paintings, which often featured luxurious settings, beautiful women, and elaborate accessories. Veronese's private life is not well-documented, but it is known that he was a man of good humor and strong personality, who valued his independence and loved luxury and fine things. He formed valuable friendships, including with the Prior of the convent of San Sebastiano, which helped him secure important commissions and establish himself as a prominent artist in Venice.

Section section_03 (Chars 16722–25082):
Section Summary: After establishing himself as a talented painter, Veronese's career flourished in Venice, where he was in high demand to decorate palaces, churches, and convents. He was commissioned to create numerous masterpieces, including the decoration of Daniele Barbaro's residence, the Doge's Palace, and the library, where he competed with other artists and was declared the winner. Veronese's most fertile production period was between 1562 and 1565, during which he created some of his most celebrated paintings, including "The Wedding at Cana" and "The Feast at the House of Simon". His painting "The Wedding at Cana" is considered one of his greatest works, showcasing his brilliance, imagination, and dexterity in execution, and is now housed in the Louvre museum. Veronese's success and reputation as a painter were unparalleled, with even Titian acknowledging his talent and the public opinion of the time considering him the foremost painter of Venice, next to Titian.

Section section_04 (Chars 25083–33497):
Section Summary: Veronese's painting, "The Wedding at Cana", is a masterpiece that showcases his skill in composition, balance, and charming details. The painting features a mix of biblical and contemporary figures, including the artist himself and other notable personalities, which was a departure from traditional religious art. Veronese's unconventional approach to art led to him being summoned by the Inquisition, where he was forced to defend his work and eventually make changes to one of his paintings, "The Feast at the House of Levi". Despite this, Veronese's work continued to gain recognition, and he received numerous commissions from various cities and patrons. His success and productivity kept him in Venice, and it wasn't until later in his life that he had the opportunity to visit Rome and see the masterpieces that inspired him.
