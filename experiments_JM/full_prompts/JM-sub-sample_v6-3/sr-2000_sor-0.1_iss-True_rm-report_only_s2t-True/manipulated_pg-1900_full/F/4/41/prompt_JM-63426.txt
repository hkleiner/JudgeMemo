You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_05 (Chars 33148–41781):
Section Summary: During the Victorian period, typography had declined, with typefounders producing novelty faces and compositors mixing multiple typefaces. However, the author, Will Bradley, developed a love for traditional Caslon typefaces after visiting the Boston Public Library and accessing the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience inspired him to establish the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1895, where he printed materials using Caslon typefaces, which initially received criticism from printers but eventually gained popularity. The Wayside Press was part of a larger aesthetic awakening in the field of publishing, with other presses and designers also producing high-quality, artistic works. Bradley's press was named for its location, which he saw as a temporary stop on his way to becoming an artist, and its device was a dandelion leaf, symbolizing a wayside growth.

Section section_06 (Chars 41782–50392):
Section Summary: The author recounts the early days of the Wayside Press, a printing business he founded to publish his art and literary magazine, Bradley: His Book.

The business grew rapidly, but the author soon found himself overwhelmed and struggling to manage the workload, leading to a decline in his health and eventual closure of the press. The author then moved to New York, where he attempted to start a new magazine and sought out the popular writer Richard Harding Davis to contribute a story.

Although his suggestions were deemed too radical at the time, they are now universal principles of illustration. The author reflects on the opportunities available to young designers and printers today, citing advances in typography, offset printing, and commercial silk-screen printing. He believes that these advances, combined with superior training, have created a new world of opportunities for creative designers and typographers.
