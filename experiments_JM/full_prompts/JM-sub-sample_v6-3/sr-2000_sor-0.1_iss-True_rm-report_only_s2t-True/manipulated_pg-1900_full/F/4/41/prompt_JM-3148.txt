You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Report: === Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7935):
Section Summary: The story begins with a boy named Davy reading to his uncle, Anthony Croft, who is blind. Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he begins to play his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony. The narrative then shifts to Anthony's childhood, where he is portrayed as a boy who hated school and longed for knowledge, but found solace in the outdoors and music. Anthony's passion for music is evident from a young age, and he would often create makeshift instruments in school, despite the disapproval of his teachers.

Section section_02 (Chars 7935–16060):
Section Summary: Anthony, a curious and inquisitive boy, was often considered lazy by the villagers because he didn't conform to traditional learning methods. However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. He had a passion for music and inventing, and spent hours taking apart and reassembling musical instruments, even creating his own unique instruments. As he grew older, Anthony's skills in repairing and restoring instruments earned him some recognition, and he was eventually trusted with valuable instruments, including a rare violin that had been hanging on a wall for half a century. Through his self-directed learning and experimentation, Anthony developed a deep understanding of the world and its workings, driven by his insatiable curiosity and love for discovery.

Section section_03 (Chars 16060–23662):
Section Summary: The village where Anthony Croft lived disapproved of his love for the violin, with some people associating it with dancing and dissipation. Despite this, Anthony's passion for music only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and playing the violin, with a deep appreciation for its beauty and harmony. At the age of 17, he made a significant discovery - a piece of 80-90 year old wood from a rare maple tree, which he vowed to use to make a perfect violin after it had completed its century of waiting. Anthony's dedication to his craft and his promise to use his talents to help others earned him a sense of purpose and direction. He was inspired by the great violin makers, including Antonius Stradivarius, and aspired to follow in their footsteps, creating perfect violins that would bring joy and beauty to others.

At the age of 40, Lyddy was finally able to start a new life in her inherited home, with a small but sufficient income and a chance to rediscover herself.
