You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8524):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a painter and her mother Sophie Marquis a musician. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school and later apprenticed to a dressmaker, but she showed no interest in these pursuits. Eventually, her father allowed her to work in his studio, where she discovered her true talent and created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which earned her father's encouragement to become an artist. With newfound determination, Rosa began to study the works of great masters at the Louvre, marking the beginning of her artistic career.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, a young artist, spent her early years studying and honing her craft, earning her the nickname "the little hussard" among museum regulars. She developed a passion for painting animals, and her dedication to her work led to her first exhibits at the Salon in 1841, where she received recognition for her talent. Rosa's success grew progressively, with her paintings and sculptures gaining praise from critics and the public, despite initial hostility from the jury. In 1848, she achieved a major breakthrough, receiving a first-class medal at the Salon, judged by her peers without academic prejudice. Through her hard work and perseverance, Rosa established herself as a renowned animal painter, known for her honesty, sincerity, and attention to detail in her art.

Rosa's passion for study and research drove her to continue learning and improving her craft, even after achieving success. Her paintings, such as "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", brought her great recognition and financial prosperity, with "The Horse Fair" being considered one of the greatest works of French painting. The story of "The Horse Fair" is notable, as it was sold to a London picture dealer, then later to an American, and eventually ended up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Rosa's success and reputation continued to grow, and she eventually moved to a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which she had built to suit her needs and was a unique and picturesque space.

Section section_04 (Chars 25361–33640):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's menagerie, which included a variety of animals, was a key part of her artistic inspiration and was housed at her studios in Paris and Chevilly. As her reputation grew, she became celebrated both in France and abroad, with critics praising her as the "inspired interpreter of rural life." She made a triumphant journey to England and Scotland, where she was warmly received and found new inspiration for her paintings. Rosa Bonheur's work was particularly popular in England, where she found a strong market for her paintings of rural life, and she eventually gave up exhibiting at the Salons to focus on fulfilling commissions. In 1865, she was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the Emperor, a testament to her international acclaim and artistic achievements.

Section section_05 (Chars 33641–42101):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur visited the Court and had a pleasant experience, discussing the intelligence of animals with the Emperor and going on an excursion with the Empress. She later sent 10 works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a second-class medal, which was seen as a snub due to her long absence from the French art scene and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, which she directed with devotion and intelligence, but eventually resigned in 1860 to focus on her own art. She then withdrew to her home in By, where she worked tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers, producing many notable works. During the Franco-Prussian War, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity, refusing to accept favors from the Prussian occupiers and instead aiding her fellow French citizens.
