You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8447):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature directly, even if it meant going to great lengths to do so. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier grew up in a time when French art was dominated by classicism, but he was influenced by the emerging romantic school. His early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, with his father initially discouraging him due to the tumultuous state of the art world at the time. Meissonier's mother, who was sensitive to music and had artistic talents, may have inspired his early interest in art, and he began drawing at a young age, using his mother's old paint-box. Despite his father's attempts to steer him towards a more practical career, Meissonier's talent and dedication to art ultimately prevailed.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–16883):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and Léon Cogniet. Despite facing financial struggles, Meissonier persevered and eventually gained recognition for his work, exhibiting for the first time at the age of 16. He began to gain success as an illustrator, particularly with his work on "The Indian Cabin", which showcased his attention to detail and realistic style. This success led to more opportunities, and Meissonier was able to establish himself as a talented artist, no longer needing to solicit work. His early success paved the way for his future career, marked by meticulous and detailed artwork that would become his signature style.

Section section_03 (Chars 16883–25494):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a renowned artist, also experimented with etching, producing limited and highly sought-after pieces, including "The Violin" and "The Signor Annibale". His paintings, often small in scale, were initially met with rejection, but he eventually gained recognition, with his work "Monk Consoling a Dying Man" being purchased by the Duke of Orleans. Meissonier's small-scale paintings were a hallmark of his style, with some critics arguing that their size was a key factor in their intensity and detail. Despite initial concerns that his paintings were too small, they were ultimately praised for their vividness and ability to draw the viewer in. Meissonier's unique approach to scale and composition allowed him to create intricate and expressive works that continue to be admired.

Section section_04 (Chars 25495–32766):
Section Summary: In 1840, Meissonier submitted several paintings to the Salon, including "A Reader", "Saint Paul", and "Isaiah", but the latter two were dull and commonplace, suggesting he was trying to paint in a different style to prove a point to his critics. Fortunately, he was discouraged from continuing down this path by Jules Chenavard and instead focused on his genre painting, such as "The Reader", which received praise from critics. Meissonier's success grew rapidly, with each subsequent painting earning him increasing distinction and acclaim, including a second-class medal and a significant purchase by collector Paul Périer. His paintings were notable for their attention to detail, realism, and ability to capture the individuality of his subjects, as described by critic Théophile Gautier. Meissonier's unique style and talent earned him recognition as a master artist, with his paintings offering a window into the lives and characters of his subjects.

Section Summary: Meissonier was a painter who was extremely meticulous about costumes and accessories, often going to great lengths to ensure historical accuracy in his work. He had a vast collection of relics and clothing from the Imperial Epoch, which he used to inform his paintings.
