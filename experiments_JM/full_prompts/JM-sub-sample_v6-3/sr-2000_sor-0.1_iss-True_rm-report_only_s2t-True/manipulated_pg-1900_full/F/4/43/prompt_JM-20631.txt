You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8745):
Section Summary: The series of lectures on Hebraic thought and learning was founded in memory of Mr. Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar who dedicated his life to studying and interpreting the language. Davis's work contributed to the revival of Hebrew, which is becoming a living and spoken language again in Palestine after being preserved as a ritual language for centuries. The concept of the "Chosen People" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. However, this idea has also been distorted and adopted by other groups, such as the Germans, who have used it to justify their own claims of superiority. The lecture series aims to explore Jewish thought and culture, starting with the concept of the "Chosen People" and its implications.

Section section_02 (Chars 8746–16963):
Section Summary: The concept of a Chosen People and certain passages in the Bible, such as those calling for vengeance and destruction, can be seen as ferocious or egotistical when taken out of context. However, these passages are often set in an ethical framework, emphasizing righteousness and justice, and must be understood within their historical conditions. The Bible is a collection of national literature, written over many generations, and contains both higher and lower strands, with some passages reflecting primitive stages of thought that have been surpassed by later spiritual evolution. Judaism has evolved over time, incorporating the fruits of centuries of spiritual growth, and has replaced more primitive practices and concepts with nobler ones. Ultimately, the Bible must be interpreted in the context of human nature and history, rather than being judged by modern standards or allegorized to fit preconceived notions.

Section section_03 (Chars 16963–25655):
Section Summary: The Old Testament reaches the highest ethical note in literature, emphasizing a universal salvation and a mission to serve humanity. The concept of a "chosen people" is often misunderstood, as it refers to a people chosen to serve a greater purpose, not for their own superiority. The Old Testament is filled with metaphors and lyrics that express a noble and idealistic vision, such as the suffering servant and the kingdom of priests. The Jewish people's mission is to bring justice, righteousness, and light to the nations, and their election is designed solely for world-service. The Old Testament's universalism is evident in its cosmic poems and passages, which extend God's benevolence to all creation, contradicting the myth of a tribalistic Jewish God.

Section section_04 (Chars 25656–33797):
Section Summary: The concept of a "tribal God" in Judaism is misleading, as the God of the Bible is depicted as a universal and righteous ruler from the beginning. The biblical account of Abraham and Moses shows a God who is concerned with justice and morality, and who is willing to listen to human criticism and appeal. The Jewish tradition has always emphasized the universal implications of its religion, and has welcomed proselytes and encouraged the spread of its teachings to all nations. This universalism is reflected in the writings of Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides, Spinoza, and modern Reform Judaism, which emphasize the shared humanity and common God of all people. The idea of a narrow, tribal God is not supported by the biblical text or the historical development of Jewish thought and practice.

Section section_05 (Chars 33798–42323):
Section Summary: The concept of being a "Chosen People" is not unique to the Jewish people, and other nations have also assigned a mission to themselves. The Jewish people's sense of mission and purpose is rooted in their biblical history and has evolved over time, with their literature and traditions reflecting a sense of intimacy and responsibility towards God. The idea of a nation having a special mission or purpose can be seen in other countries, such as America and England, which have developed their own sense of national identity and purpose over time. These nations have evolved from a sense of insular patriotism to a broader mission of defending liberties and promoting universal values. Ultimately, the concept of a "Chosen People" is a complex and multifaceted one that reflects a nation's history, culture, and values.

Section section_06 (Chars 42323–50841):
Section Summary: The period of English history from the 16th to the 18th century was marked by a struggle with France for control of India and the New World, with seven wars fought between the two nations. This era saw the establishment of the East India Company, the founding of British colonies in Virginia and New England, and the growth of British naval power. The concept of England as a "Chosen People" emerged during this time, with poets like Thomson and Kipling expressing a sense of national destiny and mission. The idea of a national mission is not unique to England, but is a universal tendency that can be seen in other nations, including ancient Israel. Over time, England's mission evolved from a self-centered focus on expansion and trade to a more universal vision of serving a higher purpose, with its poets and writers playing a key role in shaping this narrative.

Section section_07 (Chars 50841–59277):
Section Summary: The concept of "Germanism is Judaism" is deemed grotesque, with Germanism resembling Japan more than Judaism in its emphasis on state supremacy over individuality. The modern German state is characterized by its militarism and glorification of war, which is a departure from its past ideals of peace and righteousness. In contrast, Jewish literature and tradition emphasize the importance of truth, morality, and self-criticism, with the Bible often portraying Israel as the villain of its own story. The difference between Judaism and Germanism can be summed up by the word "Recessional", with Jewish writers rebuking their nation and seeking truth, while German writers glorify theirs. Overall, Germanism is more analogous to the militarism of other maritime countries, such as England, rather than Judaism.

Section section_08 (Chars 59278–67658):
Section Summary: The concept of a nation's right to its territory is often rooted in violence and massacre, but this is often glossed over in national legends. In contrast, the Bible acknowledges the violent history of Israel's occupation of Palestine, and English literature has a tradition of self-criticism and awareness of the flaws of nationalism. The author argues that Judaism has a unique contribution to make to the world, particularly in its emphasis on universalism and its potential to inspire a new world order. However, this potential has been hindered by the quarrel between Judaism and Christianity, which the author believes is exaggerated and based on misunderstandings. Ultimately, the author calls for Judaism to reassert its voice and values in the world, and to play a role in shaping a new world order that prioritizes peace, justice, and universalism.

Section section_09 (Chars 67659–71214):
Section Summary: The Jewish community is often misunderstood, as seen in Crabbe's "Borough", but it's time for them to fight for their identity and mission. This mission is to build a sense of community and connection among nations, as expressed in Nina Salaman's song. The section also pays tribute to Arthur Davis, a scholar who was self-taught but possessed a deep understanding of Hebrew literature and the Bible. He was a master of his subject and had a beautiful spirit, which is still remembered through his work and the continuation of his legacy by his daughters. His love for the liturgy and his edition of the Festival Prayers are particularly notable, and his memory remains a lasting fragrance.
