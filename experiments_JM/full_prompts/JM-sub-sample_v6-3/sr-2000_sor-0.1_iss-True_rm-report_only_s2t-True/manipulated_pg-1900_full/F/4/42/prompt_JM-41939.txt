You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8524):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a drawing master and her mother Sophie Marquis a music teacher. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After trying various occupations, including dressmaking and school, Rosa's father allowed her to focus on art, and she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which showed promise of her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to art, spending hours copying the works of great masters at the Louvre and embarking on a path to become a renowned artist.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's friend Nathalie provided her with emotional support and helped with her daily needs, allowing her to focus on her art. Despite her success, Rosa continued to study and research, often visiting slaughterhouses and later, horse fairs, to observe and sketch animals. Her hard work paid off with the creation of masterpieces like "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", which brought her widespread recognition and financial success. "The Horse Fair" was eventually sold to an American collector and later donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while a reduced replica was bequeathed to the National Gallery. Rosa's success enabled her to build a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which she designed to suit her needs and filled with her artwork and a courtyard that she transformed into a farm.

She traveled to England and Scotland, where she was warmly received and found new inspiration for her paintings, including works such as "Morning in the Highlands" and "Hay Harvest in Auvergne." Bonheur's success continued to grow, and in 1865, she was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the Empress herself.

After retiring from teaching, she devoted herself to her art, working tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers and producing many notable works. During the war of 1870, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity by aiding the suffering peasants and refusing to accept favors from the Prussian invaders.
