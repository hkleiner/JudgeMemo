You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8030):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists that he can pay him back when he gets a chance. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations behind it. The situation is tense, with underlying resentment towards Earth and its influence in the galaxy.

Section Summary: Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, is a drunkard who is grossly incompetent, yet he holds a top security job. Ramsey intervenes when Symm is hurting a Vegan girl, Mith, and after a confrontation, they escape together. Ramsey takes Mith to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she's letting on, and she's amused by the situation, particularly the Vegan girl's mistaken assumption that she's Ramsey's wife.

Ramsey agrees, but only if a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After spending the night at Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has disappeared, leaving them locked in. While searching the apartment, Ramsey finds a letter that suggests Margot is searching for something significant related to the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter hints at a mysterious connection between the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth and the sudden appearance of humanoid types on thousands of stellar worlds millions of years ago.

The Enterprise encounters eddies in hyper-space, causing the ship to lurch, and Ramsey struggles to bring it back on course. Meanwhile, the Dog Star, crewed by Ramar Chind and Garr Symm, is tracking the Enterprise's movements, taking advantage of the fact that time stands still in hyper-space.

Margot plans to venture out onto the world's surface, taking Vardin with her, and uses the threat of an m.g. gun to ensure Ramsey's compliance. However, Ramsey reveals that the gun is useless in the timeless continuum of hyper-space, as it relies on the passage of time to function. Margot is undeterred and still intends to explore the world, driven by her obsession with uncovering its secrets.

She approaches the box, which is said to hold the secret of instantaneous travel across the galaxy, but Ramsey has a vision of a cosmic game being played with proto-man, suggesting that this power is too great for humanity to wield. Just as Margot is about to reach the box, Garr Symm and his men appear, attempting to stop her and claim the box for themselves. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men, but is shocked when one of them dies from lack of air, despite being on a world where time does not exist.

Section Summary: Ramsey stops Margot from using the matter-transmission device, and instead, Garr Symm uses it and is transformed into a caveman-like creature.

Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and Ramsey has helped him succeed. With the crisis averted, Ramsey and Margot leave the planet together, and Margot confesses her love for Ramsey. They blast off into space, ready to start a new life together, free from the dangers of the matter-transmission technology.
