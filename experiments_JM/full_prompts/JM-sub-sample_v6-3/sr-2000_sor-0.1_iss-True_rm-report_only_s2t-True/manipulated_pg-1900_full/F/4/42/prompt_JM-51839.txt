You will be given a section-wise evaluation report of a human-written text. Your task is to rate the entire text according to the evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. Make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

# Task Description:
1. Before producing your output, follow these internal steps:
    a) For each metric, analyze the section-wise report and detect recurring or serious problems that lead to point deduction. Each section includes scores and labeled issues for fluency and coherence.
    b) For each metric, summarize the most impactful problems across sections.
2. For each metric, give a score between 1 and 5. You are allowed to use half-points. You should refer to the requested metrics criteria and corresponding accuracy scales.
3. It is forbidden to generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
4. It is forbidden to give corrections for detected issues.

# Evaluation Criterion and Metric Accuracy Scale:
## FLUENCY
**Definition**: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues. Any errors, if present, are rare and do not distract from reading or understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly fluent and well-structured, though may contain minor issues in grammar or phrasing. These issues may be noticeable but do not disrupt the overall readability.
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways.
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible or fragmented. The text lacks coherent structure or meaning, making it very difficult or impossible to understand.

## COHERENCE
**Definition**: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.
*Scale*:
- Score 5: Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. Sentences and ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole. Minor lapses, if any, are barely noticeable and do not hinder understanding.
- Score 4: Mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts. These do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience.
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.
- Score 1: Largely incoherent. The text lacks logical structure or progression, with many disjointed, contradictory, or confusing segments that make understanding nearly impossible.

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8254):
Section Summary: The city of Nacogdoches has a rich history dating back to the time of the Tejas Indians, who settled in the area and built homes around ceremonial mounds. According to legend, the city was founded by Nacogdoches, one of the twin sons of a Caddo chief, who was instructed to travel towards the setting sun and establish a home. The area was later visited by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle, and was also influenced by the ministrations of Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda, who taught the Tejas tribes the Christian religion. The first permanent European settlement in Nacogdoches was established in 1716 with the founding of the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches, and the city was later refounded as a civic corporation in 1779 by Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo. Over time, the city has evolved from an Indian town to a Spanish town, with a complex and fascinating history that has shaped its identity.

Section section_02 (Chars 8255–16651):
Section Summary: The eastern boundary of Texas was uncertain during the late 18th century, and the town of Nacogdoches was a key location for trade and commerce. Gil Ybarbo, a Spanish settler, built the Old Stone Fort, which served as a commissary and a place of refuge, and he governed the town as a benevolent despot. In 1800, Nacogdoches was involved in the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition, which was backed by Aaron Burr and aimed to invade Texas. The town later played a role in the Mexican Revolution against Spain, and in 1819, Dr. James Long led an expedition to Nacogdoches, declaring Texas a free and independent republic, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The town's history was marked by conflicts, power struggles, and shifting alliances between Spanish, Mexican, and American forces.

Section section_03 (Chars 16651–25199):
Section Summary: After James Long's attempt to free Texas failed in 1819, Nacogdoches regained its prestige under the leadership of Alcalde James Dill, and American settlers began to arrive. However, tensions rose between Americans, Mexicans, and Cherokee Indians, leading to the Fredonian War in 1826, which resulted in the expulsion of several prominent citizens. The Mexican government's laws and actions, including the prohibition of American immigration, further fueled the conflict, ultimately leading to the Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832, where American settlers defeated the Mexican troops. The battle marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution and led to the expulsion of Mexican troops from the territory east of San Antonio. As a result, Nacogdoches became increasingly American in character, with Americans holding positions of power and the town growing in influence.

Section section_04 (Chars 25200–33908):
Section Summary: As American customs and businesses took hold in Texas, the region experienced growth and prosperity, but this was threatened by the rising power of Mexican dictator Santa Anna. The people of Nacogdoches and surrounding areas eventually joined the war party and contributed to the Texas Revolution, with many prominent leaders emerging from the area. After the revolution, Nacogdoches played a key role in the new Republic of Texas, with many of its citizens holding important offices and contributing to the establishment of new towns and trade. However, the town faced further challenges, including the Cordova Rebellion, before eventually experiencing a decline in population and importance as new centers of trade and agriculture emerged in other parts of Texas. Despite this, Nacogdoches remained a significant hub of commerce and politics during the time of the Republic of Texas.
