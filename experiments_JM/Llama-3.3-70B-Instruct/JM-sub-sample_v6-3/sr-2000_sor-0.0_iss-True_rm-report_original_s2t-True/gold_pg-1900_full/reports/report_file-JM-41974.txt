Section section_04 (Chars 25390–33800):
Section Summary: Veronese's painting, "The Wedding at Cana", is a masterpiece that showcases his unique method, which disregards historical accuracy and traditional religious depictions. The painting features a mix of biblical figures and contemporary personalities, including the artist himself, and was widely admired by his peers. However, Veronese's unconventional approach to religious art led to him being summoned by the Inquisition, which criticized his "Feast at the House of Levi" for its perceived irreverence. Veronese defended his work, citing the precedent of other great masters, and was ultimately allowed to revise the painting to meet the Inquisition's demands. Despite this challenge, Veronese's reputation continued to grow, and he eventually made a brief trip to Rome, although details of his visit are scarce.

Section Summary: There is no evidence to suggest that Veronese practiced his art in Rome, and it is believed that he only admired the masterpieces of Raphael and Michelangelo during his visit.
