Section section_01 (Chars 0–8842):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, often compared to Dutch masters such as Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, reflecting his own gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters like Andrea Mantegna. His paintings, such as "The Angelus," capture the struggles and simple faith of rural life, and are not sentimental but rather infused with intense earnestness and melancholy truth. Millet's unique style, shaped by his experiences living among peasants, is marked by subtlety and restraint, rather than showy technique. As a painter, Millet's strength lies in his ability to convey a profound message, rather than in flashy brushwork or technical pyrotechnics.

Section section_03 (Chars 17495–26466):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, but a small group of artists, including Jean-François Millet, sought to create a new, naturalistic style. Millet was born in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, where he grew up in a peasant family and was influenced by the rugged and picturesque landscape. His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing important roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family encouraged him to pursue his artistic talents. He eventually left his rural home to migrate to Paris, where he would continue to develop his unique style and become a leading figure in the modern naturalistic school.

Section section_04 (Chars 26467–35277):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father took him to Cherbourg to show his drawings to a local painter, Mouchel, who was impressed by the young artist's talent. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who greatly influenced his style. Millet briefly studied with Delaroche, but found his academic approach stifling and eventually stopped attending his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties. Freed from these constraints, Millet was now able to develop his own unique style and work towards establishing himself as an artist.

Section Summary: Jean-François Millet struggled to make a living as an artist, and he turned to portrait-painting to support himself, but he faced rejection and financial difficulties.
