Section section_05 (Chars 37157–46507):
Section Summary: The school has two types of activities: minor and major. Minor activities, such as clubs, meet occasionally and are informal, while major activities, like sports and school events, are more formal and require more time and effort from teachers. These activities help to socialize the school, develop school pride, and teach students to work together towards a common goal. However, they can also be overdone and interfere with academic work, requiring proper direction and management from teachers and the public. Overall, these activities are an important part of the school experience and can have a positive impact on students when managed effectively.

Section section_08 (Chars 64829–70112):
Section Summary: Helping students choose the right vocation is a major challenge for homes and schools. To address this, schools are implementing vocational guidance programs, trade schools, and part-time schools to prepare students for their future careers. Some schools are using club organizations and guest speakers to provide students with information about different professions and help them make informed decisions. Many parents and community members are unaware of the resources and opportunities available in schools, leading to misconceptions about the value of education. By working together, schools can help students adjust to a vocation and prepare them for success in life.
