Vardin, a proto-man, reveals that his ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and Ramsey has unknowingly helped him. With Vardin's mission accomplished, he disappears, and Ramsey and Margot return to their ship, the Enterprise, and blast off into space together, ready to start a new life. Ramsey and Margot have found love and are excited to explore the galaxy together."
