They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief from a street boy. They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they continue to follow the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart."

Later, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grew up, he became a large, lumbering dog with a unique appearance and a humble but determined personality."

He also has a tendency to get into trouble, such as when he was given a shoulder of mutton and then forgot where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's daily walks in the village are also eventful, as he tries to make friends with other dogs, but often ends up being rebuffed, and instead visits a rabbit and receives treats from the butcher and baker."

Eileen followed and introduced herself, and the curate was immediately smitten with her. As they talked, Excalibur caused chaos, eating food and knocking over objects, but the curate was too enchanted with Eileen to mind. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself acting as a chaperon for Eileen and the curate, who spent time together playing tennis and getting to know each other."

The curate decided that he must leave the village to find work in London, where he can make a better life for himself and Eileen. The pair agreed to keep their plans a secret, sharing a cheerful but likely forced smile as they parted ways. Excalibur, oblivious to their conversation, remained a loyal but often bewildered companion to the pair."
