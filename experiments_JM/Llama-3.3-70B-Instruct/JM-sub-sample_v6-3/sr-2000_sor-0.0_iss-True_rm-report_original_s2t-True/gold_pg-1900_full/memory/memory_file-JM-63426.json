Bradley's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was driven to pursue his passion for art and design. Through his determination and talent, Bradley went on to become a pioneering figure in American graphic arts, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire new generations of artists and designers."

After saving enough money, he traveled to Chicago to pursue his dream of becoming an artist, where he met Frank Bromley, a landscape painter who introduced him to Rand McNally. However, his first attempt at working at Rand McNally was unsuccessful, and he returned to his printing job in Michigan. A few months later, he returned to Chicago and was hired by Rand McNally, where he worked in the designing and engraving department. The narrator's experiences in Chicago marked the beginning of his career in the printing and art world, with new technologies like line photo-engraving and halftones starting to emerge."

This experience had a profound impact on him, and he became inspired to create typography that was spontaneous and joyful. He later established the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, and began printing materials that reflected his newfound appreciation for traditional typography. The press's early work, including a sample book for the Strathmore Paper Company, helped to launch a new era of aesthetic awareness in commercial printing."

A quarter-century later, his work experienced a renaissance, culminating in the 1954 Portfolio, a significant design accomplishment. The portfolio was introduced at a luncheon in New York, where several notable figures paid tribute to Bradley's work. The book about Bradley's life and work was assembled from separate papers he wrote between 1949 and 1954, with some editing to create a continuous narrative. The project was a cooperative effort, with significant contributions from Peter Beilenson, who helped with design, printing, and editing."
