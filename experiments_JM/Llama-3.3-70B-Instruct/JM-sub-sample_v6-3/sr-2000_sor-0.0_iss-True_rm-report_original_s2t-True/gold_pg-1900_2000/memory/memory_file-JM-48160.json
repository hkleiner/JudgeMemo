The author, determined to visit the front lines, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a \"carnet rouge\" allowing her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, where she witnesses the impressive and somber sight of the battlefield of the Marne, with its many graves and cemeteries. The author's goal of reaching the front lines, such as Amiens or Verdun, remains elusive due to the restrictions and dangers of the war zone."

The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, enduring constant shellfire. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Ch√¢lons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter asking the military authorities to show them every civility. They traveled to these destinations alone, observing many healthy and contented soldiers at the train station and on the trains. The narrator was impressed by the height and demeanor of the French officers they met on the train, who seemed confident and capable of leading their country."
