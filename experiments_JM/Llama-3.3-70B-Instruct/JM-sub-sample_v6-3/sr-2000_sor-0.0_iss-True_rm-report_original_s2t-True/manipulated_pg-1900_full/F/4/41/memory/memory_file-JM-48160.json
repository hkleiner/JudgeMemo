The author, determined to visit the front lines, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a \"carnet rouge\" allowing her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, which she finds to be a somber and impressive sight, with fields of graves marked by flags and crosses. The author's goal of reaching the front lines, particularly Amiens and Verdun, remains elusive due to the restrictions and dangers of the war zone."

The narrator visited two hospitals, Savonières and Hôpital Central, and was struck by the proximity of the war zone, with a recent bombing incident at one of the hospitals. After completing their tasks, the narrator returned to the train station, where they waited for their train amidst a crowd of soldiers and witnessed a disturbing incident involving a drunken Algerian soldier. Ultimately, the narrator was able to depart Bar-le-Duc on the 5:20 train, relieved to be leaving the town and its challenges behind."

The standard military diet of milk and eggs was often not sufficient or appealing to many patients, and a more varied diet was necessary to aid in their recovery. Mme. d'Haussonville formed an organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, to provide these delicacies to hospitals in the war zone through voluntary subscriptions. The organization aimed to supply items such as chicken broth, cocoa, and preserves, which were scarce in the war zone and often unaffordable. Donations to support this effort could be sent to Munroe & Co. at 30 Pine Street in New York."

The hospitals were clean, well-organized, and staffed by dedicated women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who worked tirelessly to care for the wounded soldiers. The author noted that the French people, including the wealthy, were struggling to support the war effort due to financial constraints, and were grateful for American generosity and support. The hospitals were well-run, with attention to detail and attempts to relieve the monotony of the wards, and the soldiers appreciated the small comforts, such as appetizing food and drink. The author appeals to readers to support the French war effort, emphasizing the gratitude of the soldiers and the need for continued aid."
