Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he begins to play his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony. The narrative then shifts to Anthony's childhood, where he is portrayed as a boy who hated school and longed for knowledge, but found solace in the outdoors and music. Anthony's passion for music is evident from a young age, and he would often create makeshift instruments in school, despite the disapproval of his teachers."

However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. He had a passion for music and inventing, and spent hours taking apart and reassembling musical instruments, even creating his own unique instruments. As he grew older, Anthony's skills in repairing and restoring instruments earned him some recognition, and he was eventually trusted with valuable instruments, including a rare violin that had been hanging on a wall for half a century. Through his self-directed learning and experimentation, Anthony developed a deep understanding of the world and its workings, driven by his insatiable curiosity and love for discovery."

At the age of 17, he made a significant discovery - a piece of 80-90 year old wood from a rare maple tree, which he vowed to use to make a perfect violin after it had completed its century of waiting. Anthony's dedication to his craft and his promise to use his talents to help others earned him a sense of purpose and direction. He was inspired by the great violin makers, including Antonius Stradivarius, and aspired to follow in their footsteps, creating perfect violins that would bring joy and beauty to others."
