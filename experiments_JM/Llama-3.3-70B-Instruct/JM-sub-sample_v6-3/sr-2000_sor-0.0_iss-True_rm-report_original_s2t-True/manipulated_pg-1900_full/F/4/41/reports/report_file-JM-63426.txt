Section section_05 (Chars 33148–41781):
Section Summary: During the Victorian period, typography had declined, with typefounders producing novelty faces and compositors mixing multiple typefaces. However, the author, Will Bradley, developed a love for traditional Caslon typefaces after visiting the Boston Public Library and accessing the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience inspired him to establish the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1895, where he printed materials using Caslon typefaces, which initially received criticism from printers but eventually gained popularity. The Wayside Press was part of a larger aesthetic awakening in the field of publishing, with other presses and designers also producing high-quality, artistic works. Bradley's press was named for its location, which he saw as a temporary stop on his way to becoming an artist, and its device was a dandelion leaf, symbolizing a wayside growth.

Section Summary: The author recounts the early days of the Wayside Press, a printing business he founded to publish his art and literary magazine, Bradley: His Book.

The business grew rapidly, but the author soon found himself overwhelmed and struggling to manage the workload, leading to a decline in his health and eventual closure of the press. The author then moved to New York, where he attempted to start a new magazine and sought out the popular writer Richard Harding Davis to contribute a story. Davis agreed to write a story for the magazine, and generously offered to do so without payment, recognizing the author's struggling financial situation.
