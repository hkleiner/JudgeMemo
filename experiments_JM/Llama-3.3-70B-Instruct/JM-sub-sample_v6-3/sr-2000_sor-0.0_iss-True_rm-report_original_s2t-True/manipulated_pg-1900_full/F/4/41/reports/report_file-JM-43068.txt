Section section_01 (Chars 0–8762):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among his contemporaries for his profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday life. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, absorbing sincerity, and subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters. His paintings, such as "The Angelus", convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are not sentimental, but rather a truthful portrayal of the struggles and simple faith of peasant life. Millet's unique style and technique, shaped by his own life experiences and connection to the natural world, have secured his position as a great artist, even if he may not be considered a technical virtuoso.

Section section_03 (Chars 17379–25874):
Section Summary: The French art world was dominated by classical traditions during the time of Louis XVI, and any innovative or naturalistic art was strictly monitored. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his later work as an artist. His family's simple and laborious life, surrounded by the rugged and picturesque landscape of Normandy, influenced his artistic style and themes. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a contemplative character, which was encouraged by his grandmother and father. He developed an interest in art during his teenage years, drawing objects around him and eventually creating a large drawing of two shepherds, foreshadowing his later style.

Section section_04 (Chars 25875–34565):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's early life was marked by his exceptional observational skills and talent for drawing, which were encouraged by his family. He was apprenticed to a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, and later to M. Langlois, who tried to mold him in the classical tradition, but Millet eventually struck out on his own. With Langlois' support, Millet received a modest pension from the Municipal Council to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin. Millet's time in Paris was marked by struggle and discouragement, particularly during his brief stint in the studio of Delaroche, whose academic style clashed with Millet's innovative approach to art. Despite these challenges, Millet persevered, driven by his passion for art and his unique vision, which would eventually lead him to become a renowned painter.

Section section_06 (Chars 42953–51519):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet, a peasant painter, found inspiration in the daily life of villagers and peasants, which is reflected in his works. He settled in Barbizon, where he led a simple life, growing his own food and painting in the afternoons, and produced some of his most notable works, including "The Sower" and "The Gleaners". Despite his talent, Millet struggled financially and faced criticism from art critics and some fellow artists, but he continued to paint, driven by his own genius and vision.

Millet's life was marked by financial difficulties, but he found some comfort in a commission to create four allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, which brought him a sense of joy and fulfillment.
