He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, absorbing sincerity, and subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters. His paintings, such as \"The Angelus\", convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are not sentimental, but rather a truthful portrayal of the struggles and simple faith of peasant life. Millet's unique style and technique, shaped by his own life experiences and connection to the natural world, have secured his position as a great artist, even if he may not be considered a technical virtuoso."

Millet's style was characterized by restraint and a focus on conveying a message, rather than showcasing technical skill or virtuosity. He was particularly drawn to depicting the struggles and beauty of rural life, often using the changing seasons as a backdrop for his themes. Millet's art is best understood as a means to convey his philosophical observations, rather than solely as a demonstration of technical painting skill."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his later work as an artist. His family's simple and laborious life, surrounded by the rugged and picturesque landscape of Normandy, influenced his artistic style and themes. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a contemplative character, which was encouraged by his grandmother and father. He developed an interest in art during his teenage years, drawing objects around him and eventually creating a large drawing of two shepherds, foreshadowing his later style."

He was apprenticed to a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, and later to M. Langlois, who tried to mold him in the classical tradition, but Millet eventually struck out on his own. With Langlois' support, Millet received a modest pension from the Municipal Council to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin. Millet's time in Paris was marked by struggle and discouragement, particularly during his brief stint in the studio of Delaroche, whose academic style clashed with Millet's innovative approach to art. Despite these challenges, Millet persevered, driven by his passion for art and his unique vision, which would eventually lead him to become a renowned painter."

His paintings, such as \"The Angelus\" and \"Man with the Hoe\", would later become highly valued and influential, with some selling for large sums of money.

Millet's art is characterized by its poignant humanity, passionate sympathy with the working class, and a melancholic tone that reflects his own emotional depth. His influence on other artists, such as Segantini, has been profound, and his sincere and profound art continues to be celebrated for its purity and truth.
