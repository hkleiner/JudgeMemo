Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and eventually rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of this historic city."

In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it remains a significant ecclesiastical center to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and captured by the Danes, who killed many Saxons, including Archbishop Alphege, and burnt the cathedral."

The city's West Gate is one of the few remaining gates, and it was nearly demolished in the 19th century to make way for a circus procession.

The remains of lesser-known religious houses, hospitals, and churches, such as the Black Friars and Grey Friars, can also be found. Several hospitals, including St. John the Baptist and Eastbridge Hospital, are located within the city, while the old Hospital of St. Nicholas, a former leper hospital, is situated outside the city. The city's churches, with the exception of All Saints' in High Street, are also worth visiting, with St. Dunstan's being a notable example due to its connection to Sir Thomas More."
