As they traveled, they encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs, also known as \"yellow barbarians\" by the Chinese, claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago. The village has a small temple, where seven or eight lamas live and earn a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history, legends, or songs with the expedition."

The author then traveled to Kanchow, where they obtained a letter of introduction to the Tangutan Prince and prepared for a visit to the \"Yellow Tanguts\" living to the south. With a small group of followers, the author set out on a winter morning, navigating a challenging terrain of frozen rivers, steep slopes, and rocky ravines. They eventually passed through a guardhouse and continued on their journey, catching sight of a Buddhist tower in the distance."

The author noted that the lamas living in the monastery were friendly, but few in number, and that the gegen, or Great Lama, was still a child living in the mountains. The lamas were supported by voluntary contributions and played an important role in the community, performing services such as prayer-reading and fortune-telling. The author ultimately left the monastery on December 29th, after being unable to persuade the lamas to participate in anthropological measurements, and departed with a more favorable impression of the surrounding countryside."

Their diet consists of traditional nomadic foods such as tea, roasted flour, and meat, which they eat with Chinese chopsticks or their fingers. The Yögurs are a peaceful and content people, with no evidence of quarreling or dissatisfaction, and they spend their evenings singing, praying, and socializing around the fire. Their livestock, including yaks, sheep, and horses, appear to be of good quality, but the Yögurs have not fully recovered from the losses they suffered during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs do not seem to engage in sports or hunting, and their only notable activity is target practice with rifles, which they obtain from Sinin."

The author then arrived at the Chinese town of Li-yen, also known as \"the garden of pear trees\", which was surrounded by tall willow trees and steep hills. The author was warmly received by the friendly old mandarin, who sent them a delicious dinner and showed them great courtesy. The author eventually left Li-yen and continued their journey to Kanchenp'u and then Kanchow."
