Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and eventually rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of this historic city.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–16859):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it remains a significant ecclesiastical center to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and captured by the Danes, who killed many Saxons, including Archbishop Alphege, and burnt the cathedral.

Section section_03 (Chars 16860–25078):
Section Summary: The body of Archbishop Alphege was brought back to Canterbury from London by King Canute, who made amends for the devastation caused by his people. The Saxon cathedral was later destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in the Norman style by Archbishop Lanfranc in 1077. The new cathedral underwent further changes, including the construction of a new choir by Prior Ernulph, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket by four knights in 1170. The events surrounding Becket's murder, including his final interview with the knights, are a pivotal part of Canterbury's history and a significant factor in its becoming a major pilgrimage site.

Section section_04 (Chars 25079–33275):
Section Summary: Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered by four knights in the cathedral after a heated argument. Despite being aware of the danger, Becket refused to take measures to ensure his safety, and the knights ultimately killed him with several sword strokes. After his death, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, with the discovery of his hair-cloth shirt and the presence of vermin on his body being seen as evidence of his austerity and devotion. The news of his martyrdom sparked a wave of pilgrims to Canterbury, and his relics became highly valued for their supposed healing properties. King Henry II, who had been implicated in Becket's death, later performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and shedding tears at Becket's tomb.

Section section_05 (Chars 33276–42065):
Section Summary: After King Henry II's penance for the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, the Cathedral of Canterbury became a major pilgrimage site, attracting vast crowds and wealth. A fire in 1174 damaged the cathedral, and it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, which combined Romanesque and Gothic elements. The shrine of Becket was completed in 1220, and the translation of his remains was a grand ceremony attended by many dignitaries. Over the centuries, the cathedral underwent further changes, including the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style, and it remained a major center of the English Church. Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the decline of the city, Canterbury remained an important and historic city, with the cathedral at its heart.

Section Summary: The city's medieval architecture is on full display as one approaches the West Gate and enters St. Peter's Street, lined with old houses and shops. A narrow turning, Mercery Lane, offers a glimpse of the Cathedral's western towers, drawing the visitor in with its romantic charm. The Cathedral's precincts are filled with historic buildings, including the remains of the infirmary, the treasury, and the prior's lodging, showcasing a mix of Norman and Perpendicular styles. The Green Court, a grassy space surrounded by trees, offers a picturesque view of the Angel Steeple and the surrounding buildings. The Cathedral itself is a masterpiece of ordered beauty, with a stunning nave and intricate architectural details that await exploration.

Section section_07 (Chars 50388–58854):
Section Summary: The Cathedral's nave is a vast and magnificent space that showcases the contrast between the grandeur of the building and the smallness of everyday life. The nave was once filled with colorful paintings, stained glass, and ornate decorations, but these were removed after the Reformation, leaving a more subdued atmosphere. The Cathedral is home to many notable monuments, including those of Dean Farrar, Bishop Willial Broughton, and the Black Prince, whose tomb is a masterpiece of medieval craftsmanship. The Trinity Chapel, where the shrine of St. Thomas once stood, is now an empty space, but it still holds great historical and cultural significance. The chapel is also the final resting place of King Henry IV and features a beautiful thirteenth-century mosaic pavement.

Section section_08 (Chars 58854–67491):
Section Summary: The eastern extension of the Canterbury Cathedral chapel, known as Becket's Crown, contains a chair made of Purbeck marble where Archbishops are enthroned. The Trinity Chapel features a remarkable series of 13th-century stained glass windows that depict the miracles of St. Thomas, which are some of the finest examples of their kind in England. The city of Canterbury still retains much of its medieval charm, with its old walls and narrow streets, despite the destruction of many of its historic gates and buildings over the years. The city's West Gate is one of the few remaining gates, and it was nearly demolished in the 19th century to make way for a circus procession. The nearby St. Augustine's Abbey, founded by Augustine in the 6th century, has been restored and now serves as a missionary college, preserving its historic significance and association with the early days of Christianity in England.

Section section_09 (Chars 67491–69152):
Section Summary: Canterbury has more to offer beyond its famous Cathedral, Abbey, and St. Martin's Church. The city is home to other historical sites, including the Castle, old inns, and examples of early domestic architecture. The remains of lesser-known religious houses, hospitals, and churches, such as the Black Friars and Grey Friars, can also be found. Several hospitals, including St. John the Baptist and Eastbridge Hospital, are located within the city, while the old Hospital of St. Nicholas, a former leper hospital, is situated outside the city. The city's churches, with the exception of All Saints' in High Street, are also worth visiting, with St. Dunstan's being a notable example due to its connection to Sir Thomas More.
