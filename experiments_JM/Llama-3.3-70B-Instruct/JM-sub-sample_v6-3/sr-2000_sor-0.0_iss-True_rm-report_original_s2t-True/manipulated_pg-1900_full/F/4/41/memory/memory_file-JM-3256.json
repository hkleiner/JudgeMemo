A true bookman is born with a passion for literature and has a deep understanding of what makes a good book, regardless of their education or training. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary knowledge, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may buy or collect books without truly appreciating their value, and it is the ability to distinguish between meaningful and fleeting literature that defines a true bookman. Ultimately, a bookman is someone who has a genuine love for reading and can appreciate the difference between books that are truly worthwhile and those that are merely entertaining."

The bookman's taste in literature is eclectic, ranging from essays by Lamb and Hazlitt to the works of De Quincey, and he values books that are well-written and thought-provoking, regardless of their subject matter. He is a romantic at heart, with a love for literature that is driven by passion rather than a desire for accurate information.

The author also discusses the joy of rearranging books on a shelf, comparing it to a form of spring cleaning, and how it brings back memories and delight. The bookman's ideal holiday is to spend a week in their own library, surrounded by books and a beautiful garden, with no distractions or obligations. The passage concludes by imagining a meeting of bookmen, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and a Bishop of Durham, who share a passion for books and learning."

A father with a book obsession can \"inoculate\" his son with the same disease, passing on his love of books and creating a lifelong passion. The author humorously compares book collecting to a disease, suggesting that it can be incurable and lead to financial struggles, with the sufferer's wife often being the one to encourage moderation.
