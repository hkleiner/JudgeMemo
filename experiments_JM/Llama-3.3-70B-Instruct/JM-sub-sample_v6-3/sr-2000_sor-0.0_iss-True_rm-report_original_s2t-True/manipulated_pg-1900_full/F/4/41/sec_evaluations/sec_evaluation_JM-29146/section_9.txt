Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] missing articles
* [SPELLING] typos (e.g. "Nargot" instead of "Margot", "Rhey" instead of "They", "Ramdey" instead of "Ramsey", "lwss" instead of "less", "grayvmurk" instead of "gray murk")
* [LEXICON] word choice (e.g. "somehow--existed" could be rephrased for better clarity)
* [SYNTAX] sentence structure (e.g. some sentences are long and convoluted)
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] inconsistent pacing (e.g. the scene with Margot walking towards the box seems to slow down and speed up abruptly)
* [STRUCTURE] abrupt transitions (e.g. the shift from the description of the music to the appearance of the teleporter)
* [CLARITY] unclear motivations (e.g. Vardin's sudden display of strength and confidence)
* [TRANSITION] lack of clear connections between some scenes (e.g. the vision of proto-man playing chess with Margot)
