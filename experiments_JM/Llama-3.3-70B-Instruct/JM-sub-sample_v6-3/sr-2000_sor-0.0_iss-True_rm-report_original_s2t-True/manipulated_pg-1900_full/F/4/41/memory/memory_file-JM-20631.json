Davis's work, including his writings on Hebrew accents and his role in editing the Festival Prayer Book, has contributed to the revival of Hebrew as a living language. The concept of a \"Chosen People\" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. However, this idea has also been echoed in other cultures, such as Germanism, which has evolved its own doctrine of special election. The author notes that Judaism's concept of election has been misunderstood and misrepresented, and that it is not unique to the Jewish people."

This ideal is reflected in Jewish liturgy and prayer, which emphasizes the importance of obedience to the Law and the pursuit of justice and righteousness. Ultimately, the essence of Judaism lies in an apostolic altruism, with the goal of serving the world and promoting the Kingdom of God, rather than seeking self-sufficiency or superiority."

The Jewish tradition also shows a strong emphasis on reason, love, and morality, with figures like Abraham, Moses, and Maimonides portraying God as a just and righteous ruler. The Jewish people's history and literature reveal a recurring clash between centripetal and centrifugal forces, with the universal implications of their religion ultimately prevailing. This universalism is reflected in the Jewish tradition's openness to proselytes and its recognition of the value of non-Jewish wisdom and morality."

This period, marked by struggles with France for colonial dominance, saw the rise of the British Empire, with poets like Thomson and Kipling contributing to a sense of national destiny. However, this notion of a \"chosen people\" was tainted by the slave trade, poverty, and other social ills, and was later spiritualized by Kipling to emphasize a more universal mission. The concept of a national mission is often retrospective, with nations attributing purposes to themselves that they were not originally conscious of, and is shaped by a combination of historical events, cultural influences, and poetic imagination. Ultimately, the idea of a national mission is complex and evolving, as seen in the case of England, which is still shaping its sense of purpose and identity."

The true nature of Germanism is revealed in its glorification of war and the \"Will-to-Power\" philosophy, which is a perversion of nobler ideals. Germany's transformation into a militaristic and industrial power is seen as a degeneration of its nobler soul, and its actions are a threat to civilization.

In contrast, German literature often lacks self-criticism, with some exceptions from Jewish writers like Maximilian Harden. The author suggests that Judaism has a valuable contribution to make in building a new \"City of God\" amidst the crisis of civilization, and that its universalist genius can be rekindled. Ultimately, the author argues that Judaism has a future and can enrich its canon with new expressions of the Hebrew genius, rather than being surpassed by other religions like Christianity or Islam."
