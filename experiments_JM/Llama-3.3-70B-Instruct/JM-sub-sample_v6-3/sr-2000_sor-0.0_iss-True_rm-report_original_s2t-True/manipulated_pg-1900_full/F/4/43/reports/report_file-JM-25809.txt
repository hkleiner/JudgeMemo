Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is struggling to find gold in Sweet Briar Gulch, despite his calculations indicating it should be there. He is also dealing with a personal setback, having received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability. Jim is heartbroken and feels like the world is against him, but his mood is briefly lifted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who offers him advice and tries to cheer him up. However, Jim declines Bud's suggestion to go to town and have a good time, citing that he is "busted" and unable to pay him back if he were to borrow money. Despite his struggles, Jim holds onto the hope of finding gold and being with Anne, and is consoled by the thought of their potential life together in the gulch.
