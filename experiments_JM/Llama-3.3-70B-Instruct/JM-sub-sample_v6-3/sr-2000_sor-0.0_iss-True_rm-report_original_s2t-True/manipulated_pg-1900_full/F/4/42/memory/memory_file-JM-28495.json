They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are thwarted, including a humorous encounter with a mischievous street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and comical."

The next day, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grew up, he became a large, lumbering dog with a unique appearance and a humble but determined personality."

He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then forgets where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search.

One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, and made a mess, but Eileen's charm and apology helped to break the ice and introduce her to the curate. As Eileen and the curate spent more time together, Excalibur became a frequent chaperone, and his presence was tolerated despite the chaos he often caused, such as on the tennis lawn where Eileen and the curate would play. Excalibur's laid-back nature made him a patient and forgiving companion, even in the midst of noisy and chaotic situations."

The curate felt that he couldn't provide for Eileen on his own and decided that he needed to leave for London to find work and build a better future for them. Despite their concerns, the pair put on a brave face and decided not to share their plans with others. Excalibur, oblivious to their troubles, continued to enjoy his time with Eileen, even if it meant enduring boring and exhausting activities like golf."
