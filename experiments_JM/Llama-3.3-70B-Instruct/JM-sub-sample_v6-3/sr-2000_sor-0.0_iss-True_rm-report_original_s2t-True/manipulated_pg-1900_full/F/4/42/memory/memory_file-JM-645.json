The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although Lady Jane later brings it up and praises it.

        "section_summary": "The narrator is anxious about the possibility of Hugh Vereker's death and the loss of the opportunity to learn the secret of his writing. After Vereker's death, the narrator waits for Drayton Deane, who has married Gwendolen Corvick, to reveal the secret, but Deane remains silent on the matter. The narrator is convinced that Deane knows the secret, but is either unable or unwilling to share it, which only deepens the mystery and the narrator's obsession. The narrator's frustration grows as he observes Deane's lack of interest in sharing the secret, and he begins to believe that Deane is too stupid to appreciate its value. Eventually, the narrator seizes an opportunity to approach Deane directly and offer to make a deal for the information, but Deane's response is unforthcoming."

        "section_summary": "The narrator discusses Hugh Vereker's secret, the underlying intention of his books, with a man who was married to Mrs. Deane, a woman who supposedly knew Vereker's secret. However, the man claims he has no knowledge of the secret, revealing that his wife never shared it with him. The narrator is shocked and disappointed, realizing that Mrs. Deane didn't think her husband was worthy of knowing the secret. The narrator then shares his own story of trying to uncover Vereker's secret, and the man listens with growing interest and curiosity. The two men are now united in their desire to uncover the secret, with the man's ignorance of his wife's knowledge adding to his motivation."
