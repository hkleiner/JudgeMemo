Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature precisely.

Despite this, Meissonier's talent and dedication eventually prevailed, and he went on to become a successful artist.

Section section_07 (Chars 49163–52658):
Section Summary: Meissonier was a painter who went to great lengths to ensure accuracy in his costumes and accessories, often going so far as to collect relics from the Imperial Epoch he worshipped. He had a vast "working library" of historical items, including clothing and jewelry, which he used to meticulously research and recreate scenes from French history. Meissonier's attention to detail was so intense that he even researched the way linen was cut in the 18th century to achieve greater authenticity in his paintings.
