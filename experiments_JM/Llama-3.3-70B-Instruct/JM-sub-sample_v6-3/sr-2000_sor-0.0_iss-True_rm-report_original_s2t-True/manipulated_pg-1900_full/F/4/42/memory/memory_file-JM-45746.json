The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who approached it as a mere job and another who made it a profession, demonstrating a genuine interest in education and a willingness to improve. The second young man's enthusiasm and dedication to creating a comfortable and attractive learning environment ultimately led to his success and advancement in the field. In the next chapter, the author discusses the importance of considering one's strengths and preferences when seeking a teaching position, and how boards of education evaluate candidates based on personality, preparation, and experience. A pleasing and forceful personality is highlighted as a key factor in a teacher's success, and the author reflects on the positive influence of an inspirational teacher in their own educational journey."

In a separate meeting with the school board, the author presents a detailed report on the first day of school, which earns the board's appreciation and leads to an extension of their authority. This, in turn, enables the author to make more efficient decisions, such as ordering supplies, and ultimately reduces the cost of school supplies."
