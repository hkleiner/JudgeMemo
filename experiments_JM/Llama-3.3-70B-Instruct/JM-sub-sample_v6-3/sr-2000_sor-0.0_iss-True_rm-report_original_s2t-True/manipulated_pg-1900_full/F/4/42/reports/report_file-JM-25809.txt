Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is sitting on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated with his lack of success in finding gold. He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation, and he is deeply hurt by her words. Despite his feelings, Jim is interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who tries to cheer him up and suggests that he take a break and go to town to have some fun. However, Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and also because he is "busted" and doesn't want to accumulate more debt.

Ches, who works with Jim, is tasked with dumping the dirt outside the tunnel and is initially struggling with the hard labor, but he perseveres. The two men take a break from their work to go on a hunting trip, but instead of shooting the deer, Jim tries to catch one with his bare hands, leading to a surprising and intense encounter.
