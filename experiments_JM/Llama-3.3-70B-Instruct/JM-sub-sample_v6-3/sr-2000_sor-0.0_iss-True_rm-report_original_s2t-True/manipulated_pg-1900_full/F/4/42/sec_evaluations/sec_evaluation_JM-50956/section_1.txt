* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Russia's sacrifices to analyzing Germany's chances of winning the war
* [STRUCTURE] The chapters seem disconnected, with the second chapter not clearly building on the first
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or ambiguous ("The final catastrophe of the Central Powers was the direct consequence of the offensive of the Allies in 1918, but Russia made possible this collapse to a considerable degree")
