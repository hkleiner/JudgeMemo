Section section_01 (Chars 0–8030):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists that he can pay him back when he gets a chance. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8031–15997):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations behind it. The situation is tense, with underlying resentment towards Earth and its influence in the galaxy.

Section section_03 (Chars 15998–23560):
Section Summary: Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, is a drunkard who is grossly incompetent, yet he holds a top security job. Ramsey intervenes when Symm is hurting a Vegan girl, Mith, and after a confrontation, they escape together. Ramsey takes Mith to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she's letting on, and she's amused by the situation, particularly the Vegan girl's mistaken assumption that she's Ramsey's wife.

Section Summary: Captain Ramsey is approached by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl and former tri-di star, who offers him a deal: she'll pay him to take her through hyper-space to Centauri in exchange for his piloting skills. Ramsey agrees, but only if a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After spending the night at Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has left and locked them in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter that suggests Margot is searching for information about the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter hints at a significant discovery related to the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which may hold the key to understanding the sudden appearance of humanoid life on thousands of stellar worlds.

Section Summary: A dying man writes a letter to his daughter Margot, revealing his theory about "proto-man," a being who allegedly traveled through hyper-space and populated the galaxy with humans. He believes that whoever discovers proto-man's secret will become incredibly powerful, and he wants Margot to continue his work. Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, to escape from Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security. They work on repairing a old spaceship in a junkyard, while trying to avoid detection, and Margot uses her mind-reading abilities to sense that they are being watched. As they work together, Ramsey finds himself drawn to Margot, but she rejects his advances, and they continue to focus on their mission to uncover the truth about proto-man.

Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are working on repairing a spaceship in the Spacer Graveyard, while being followed by Irwadi Security Forces. Margot discovers that Ramsey is hiding something from her, referred to as "X", but he refuses to reveal what it is. Meanwhile, Security Officer Ramar Chind reports to his boss, Garr Symm, who reveals that he wants to let the trio escape so they can lead him to something of immense importance. Garr Symm's plan is to follow them and use the information they uncover to make Irwadi the dominant planet in the galaxy. Vardin helps the group find a crucial fuel supply, a U-235 slow-implosion capsule, which brings them one step closer to completing their mission.

Section section_07 (Chars 48070–56391):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison, a beautiful woman, is on a mission with Ramsey and Vardin, but her true intentions are unclear. They board the spaceship Enterprise, preparing for blastoff, while being watched by the occupants of the Dog Star, a rival ship. As they enter hyper-space, Ramsey explains the concept of timelessness in this dimension, which sparks Margot's curiosity about proto-man, a pre-human ancestor who discovered hyper-space. The Enterprise encounters eddies in hyper-space, causing the ship to lurch, and Ramsey struggles to bring it back on course. Meanwhile, the Dog Star, crewed by Ramar Chind and Garr Symm, is tracking the Enterprise's movements, taking advantage of the fact that time stands still in hyper-space.

Once they arrive, Margot discovers that the environment is hostile, with extreme cold and lack of atmosphere, but she becomes determined to explore the world after Ramsey inadvertently reveals a potential way to survive the conditions. Margot plans to venture out onto the world's surface, taking Vardin with her, and uses the threat of an m.g. gun to ensure Ramsey's compliance. However, Ramsey reveals that the gun is useless in the timeless continuum of hyper-space, as it relies on the passage of time to function. Margot is undeterred and still intends to explore the world, driven by her obsession with uncovering its secrets.

Section section_09 (Chars 64490–72544):
Section Summary: Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin venture outside the Enterprise, where they hear a beautiful, otherworldly music that seems to be the "Music of the Spheres". As they listen, the gray murk surrounding them begins to clear, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot identifies as a matter-transmitter. She approaches the box, which is said to hold the secret of instantaneous travel across the galaxy, but Ramsey has a vision of a cosmic game being played with proto-man, suggesting that this power is too great for humanity to wield. Just as Margot is about to reach the box, Garr Symm and his men appear, attempting to stop her and claim the box for themselves. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men, but is shocked when one of them dies from lack of air, despite being on a world where time does not exist.

Section Summary: Ramsey stops Margot from using the matter-transmission device, and instead, Garr Symm uses it and is transformed into a caveman-like creature.

Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and Ramsey has helped him succeed. With the crisis averted, Ramsey and Margot leave the planet together, and Margot confesses her love for Ramsey. They blast off into space, ready to start a new life together, free from the dangers of the matter-transmission technology.
