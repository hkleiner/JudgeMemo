Section Summary: The narrator and his wife Stella attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but they ended up on a wild goose chase through the streets. The man eventually led them to his home, where he and his wife disappeared, leaving the narrator and Stella exhausted and dogless. Later, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a loyal and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and developing into a unique-looking dog with a personality to match.

He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then can't remember where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic scene. Excalibur's daily walks are also marked by his attempts to make friends with other dogs, which are often unsuccessful, and his visits to a rabbit and local shops, where he is treated with affection and scraps.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various shopkeepers and animals. Eileen had attempted to teach Excalibur tricks, but he was not very successful and often got into trouble. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, and made a mess, but Eileen's charm and apology quickly won over the curate. The curate and Eileen struck up a conversation, and Excalibur became a regular chaperone for their interactions, including tennis games on the lawn. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself overworked in his new role, but he tolerated the disruptions to his usual routine with his usual good nature.

On a country walk, Excalibur encountered a hare that ran underneath him, leaving him unstrung, and later found Eileen and the curate sitting together, holding hands, and discussing their future. The curate revealed that he had limited financial means and felt they could not afford to marry, leading to a decision that he would have to leave for London to find work and build a future for them. Eileen and the curate agreed to keep their plans a secret, sharing a cheerful smile to hide their true feelings of low spirits.
