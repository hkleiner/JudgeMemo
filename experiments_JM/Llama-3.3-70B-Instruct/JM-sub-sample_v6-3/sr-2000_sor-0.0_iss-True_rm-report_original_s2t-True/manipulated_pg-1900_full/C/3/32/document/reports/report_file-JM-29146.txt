Section section_01 (Chars 0–8004):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government has taken this step to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships, and to charge high prices for it. Ramsey, now stranded on Irwadi, must find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene. With a few hundred credits to his name, Ramsey sets out into the harsh Irwadian wind, unsure of what the future holds.

Section Summary: Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with a being known as proto-man, which makes him realize that humanity is not ready for the power of matter-transmission.

Vardin, a being who is a guardian of the galaxy, explains that her ancestors discovered the power of matter-transmission but did not understand it, and it ultimately led to their downfall. Ramsey and Margot escape the planet, and Vardin disappears, leaving them to return to their ship and blast off into space.
