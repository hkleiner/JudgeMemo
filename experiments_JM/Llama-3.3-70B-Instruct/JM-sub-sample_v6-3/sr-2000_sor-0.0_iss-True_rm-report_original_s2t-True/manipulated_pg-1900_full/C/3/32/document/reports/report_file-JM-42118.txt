Growing up in a picturesque and romantic environment, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a career in painting.

Section section_02 (Chars 7777–15966):
Section Summary: At the age of 16, Jean-Honoré Fragonard's mother took him to Paris to meet the renowned painter François Boucher, who advised him to train with Jean-Siméon Chardin to master his craft. Fragonard initially struggled under Chardin's tutelage, but after being dismissed, he spent time studying and painting the masterpieces in Parisian churches, which helped him improve significantly. He later returned to Boucher's studio, where he worked on decorative cartoons and enlargements for tapestries, receiving ideal training for his future career. Fragonard went on to win the Prix de Rome and spent time in Italy, where he was influenced by the works of Tiepolo and ultimately developed his own unique style. During his time in Italy, Fragonard formed lasting friendships with fellow artists Hubert Robert and the Abbé de Saint-Non, which helped spread his name and reputation.

Section section_03 (Chars 15967–23928):
Section Summary: After spending five years in Italy, Fragonard returned to Paris in 1761, filled with enthusiasm and ambition for his art. He initially painted in the academic style, but soon turned to depicting the life and beauty of his native France, which brought him great success. His painting "Les hazards heureux de l'Escarpolette" (The Happy Accidents of the Swing) became particularly famous, and he became the mirror of the court and the age of Du Barry. Fragonard's art was characterized by his love of landscape and his use of subjects as an excuse for glorious pictures of trees and nature. He went on to produce many works, becoming one of the great decorative painters of France, known for his ability to create delightful and pleasing pictures that brought joy to those who lived with them.

Section section_04 (Chars 23928–31970):
Section Summary: Fragonard's master, Boucher, introduced him to the wealthy and art-loving farmer-general Bergeret de Grandcour, who became one of Fragonard's most important patrons. During this time, Fragonard created several masterpieces, including the "Fête de St. Cloud," and began working on a series of panels for the notorious dancer Mademoiselle Guimard. The Pompadour, a powerful figure in the royal court, died in 1764, but not before promoting the arts and encouraging artists to paint their own age rather than imitating the past. Fragonard's career continued to flourish, and he went on to create notable works, including the "Chiffre d'Amour" and "Fair-haired Boy." Meanwhile, the royal court was undergoing significant changes, with the rise of Madame du Barry, a young and beautiful woman who would become the king's mistress and a influential figure in the court.

Section section_05 (Chars 31970–39945):
Section Summary: King Louis XV's infatuation with Madame du Barry, a woman of questionable taste, led to the degradation of the French throne and ultimately cost his minister, Choiseul, dearly. Fragonard, a renowned artist, was commissioned to paint a series of canvases, "The Progress of Love," for du Barry, but she rejected them, possibly due to their lack of indecency. The rejection of his work was a significant blow to Fragonard, but he soon found new inspiration in his personal life after marrying Marie Anne Gérard, with whom he had two children. His marriage marked a turning point in his art, as he shifted from painting frivolous scenes to more tender and domestic ones, influenced by the Dutch landscapists. Fragonard's new style brought a sense of dignity and beauty to his work, solidifying his position as a skilled and original artist.

Section section_06 (Chars 39946–48129):
Section Summary: The old painter, Boucher, died in 1770, the same year that Choiseul was driven from power by a trio of men using Madame Du Barry as their tool. King Louis XV died of smallpox in 1774, and his death marked the end of an era, with the new king, Louis XVI, and his queen, Marie Antoinette, taking the throne. The writings of intellectuals such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot spread throughout the land, stirring passions and appealing to the people's desire for freedom and self-respect. Meanwhile, artist Fragonard was at the height of his career, enjoying success and luxury, including a grand tour of Italy with his patron, Bergeret de Grandcour. As Fragonard basked in his success, the seeds of revolution were being sown, and the consequences of the privileged class's corruption and ruthlessness would eventually reach his doorstep.

Section Summary: Fragonard traveled to Italy, attending a concert and meeting Emma Hamilton, before returning to Paris due to the death of King Louis XV. Upon his return, he became embroiled in a lawsuit with a friend over some of his sketches, but the issue was eventually resolved. Fragonard was granted a studio and apartments at the Louvre, where he lived a comfortable life and befriended his sister-in-law, Marguerite Gérard. However, his life was soon disrupted by the French Revolution, which began in 1789 and brought significant changes and violence to France. As the Revolution progressed, Fragonard, who sympathized with the people's suffering, found himself caught up in the turmoil, eventually giving up his jewelry to support the National Assembly.

Section section_08 (Chars 56257–64111):
Section Summary: The French Revolution led to a power struggle between the Girondists and Jacobins, resulting in the Reign of Terror, which lasted from July 1793 to July 1794. During this time, many people, including King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and numerous others, were executed by guillotine. The artist Fragonard, who had been a prominent figure in pre-Revolutionary France, struggled to adapt to the new era and eventually fled Paris to escape the violence and persecution. He returned to Paris after Napoleon came to power, but his artistic career had declined, and he was no longer in fashion. The Revolution had brought an end to the elegant and refined art of 18th-century France, replacing it with a new, severe, and classical style.

Section section_09 (Chars 64111–67991):
Section Summary: The old painter Fragonard is described as a cheerful and alert man, despite his advanced age of 74. He lived through significant events, including Napoleon's rise to power and the suppression of the artists' lodging at the Louvre, which forced him to move to a new home. Fragonard's life came to an end on August 22, 1806, when he died of brain congestion after becoming overheated on a sultry day. His legacy, along with that of other great painters like Watteau and Boucher, was initially neglected but has since been rediscovered and celebrated. Fragonard's art is seen as embodying the spirit of 18th-century France, capturing its elegance, gaiety, and romance, and serving as a lasting testament to the era's beauty and significance.
