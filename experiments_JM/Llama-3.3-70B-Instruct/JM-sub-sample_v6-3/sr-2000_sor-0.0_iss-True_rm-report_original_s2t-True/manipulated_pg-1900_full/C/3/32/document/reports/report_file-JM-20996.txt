Section Summary: The author and other teachers arrived in Manila and were struck by the city's cosmopolitan atmosphere, with people from various nationalities and professions. After a two-week wait, they received a notice instructing them to prepare for assignment to remote areas, which caused consternation and led to a mass meeting and a petition for aid. Eventually, the teachers were reassured and agreed to proceed to their stations, and they had a final joyful meeting before separating. The author then traveled to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros, where they arrived by ship and were struck by the town's remote and unassuming appearance. As they entered the town, they witnessed the departure of American troops and the beginning of a new era of peace, with the author and other teachers arriving to take on new roles.

Section section_05 (Chars 34890–43627):
Section Summary: The Philippines has two extremes of life: one is active, progressive, and cosmopolitan, while the other is inactive, decadent, and narrow. The former is characterized by a pleasant life with access to various amenities, while the latter is marked by a simple, traditional way of life in quiet hamlets. In these hamlets, life is slow-paced and unchanged for generations, with limited exposure to the outside world. The Filipino home life also varies greatly between the rich and the poor, with the wealthy enjoying comfortable homes and abundant food, while the poor, known as the "tao", live in simpler conditions with limited access to food and amenities. Overall, the Philippines presents a stark contrast between modernity and tradition, with a wide gap between the rich and the poor.

Section section_06 (Chars 43628–52106):
Section Summary: The narrator visited a leper settlement, initially receiving a hostile reception, but eventually gained access to the community with the help of guides and interpreters. The settlement was found to be a cluster of grass huts where people with leprosy lived, worked, and raised families, despite their debilitating condition. The narrator was struck by the contrast between the suffering and the normalcy of life in the settlement, where people experienced emotions like love, hatred, and joy. In a separate incident, the narrator joined a group of soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening a nearby town. The pursuit was ultimately unsuccessful, but it provided a glimpse into the primitive conditions and contrasts between traditional and modern life in the Philippines.

Section Summary: The narrator and others got on a cart pulled by a carabao, with the driver instructed to head back to their post without stopping.

Despite the rough ride, they slept soundly, only waking up when the sun was high in the sky, shining down on their faces. When they awoke, they were approaching a small village at the foot of the mountains. In the village, they procured ponies to take them back to their post.
