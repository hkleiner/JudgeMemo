They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful, and they are even misled by a mischievous street boy. The couple then decides to follow a man wearing a uniform with a badge that appears to be related to the Home for Lost Dogs, in the hopes that he will lead them to their destination. As they try to track the man discreetly, they find themselves in a series of awkward and humorous situations."

Later, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a loyal and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and developing into a unique-looking dog with a personality to match."

The curate revealed that he had limited financial means and felt they could not afford to marry, leading to a decision that he would have to leave for London to find work and build a future for them.
