In 1888, a number of clay tablets were unearthed near the ruins, which were found to be part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Amenophis III and IV. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealed that the Semitic language was used for diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and contained letters from Egyptian officials, Asiatic kings, and the Pharaoh's Foreign Office. The discovery of these tablets provided valuable insights into the language, culture, and politics of the ancient East, and shed light on the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, who introduced a new era of peace and cultural development in Egypt. The tablets also showed that the Egyptian court had extensive correspondence with other kingdoms, including Mitani, Alashia, and the Hittite kingdom."

The king's efforts to reform and secularize the royal power were met with resistance, prompting him to move the capital to Tell el Amarna and adopt a new name, Akhen-Aten. The new doctrine was not widely accepted, and the Asiatic provinces continued to enjoy self-government under Egyptian supremacy, but with many disadvantages, including constant struggles between native princes and the pressure of immigrant Bedaw√¨n tribes. The tribute system and the immigration of these tribes caused much hardship and conflict, leading to a complex web of alliances, treaties, and wars. The king's officials, including Yanhamu, the governor of Lower Egypt, played a significant role in maintaining order and collecting tribute, but their efforts were often hindered by the chaos and instability in the region."

The Egyptian government, despite being well-informed, took a middle course by sending inadequate military expeditions, which sometimes restored peace but ultimately failed to check serious hostilities. The knowledge of the pharaoh's distance and the chiefs' defiance led to open robberies and plundering, despite the continued flow of rhetorical devotion in letters. The letters from Asiatic kings, such as Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relationships, including matrimonial alliances and requests for gold, which were often marked by reluctance and evasiveness. The correspondence also highlights the strained relationships between the Egyptian pharaohs and their neighboring princes, including King Tushratta of Mitani, who sought to secure his kingdom's existence through alliances with Egypt."

The Egyptian king, Nimmuria, responded with gifts and promises, but his successor, Akhenaten, took a different approach, seeking new alliances and ignoring existing ones. Akhenaten's foreign policy was marked by impulsiveness and a lack of diplomacy, leading to strained relationships with other kingdoms, including Babylonia and Assyria.

Mitani's king, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, but the kingdom eventually fell, giving way to small Aramaic kingdoms and Assyrian control. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also faced a swift decline, with the city of Akhetaten being abandoned and the reforms of Pharaoh Akhenaten being reversed after his death. The clay tablets from this period, known as the Tell el Amarna tablets, were preserved by being hidden in the earth, providing valuable insights into the history of the region."
