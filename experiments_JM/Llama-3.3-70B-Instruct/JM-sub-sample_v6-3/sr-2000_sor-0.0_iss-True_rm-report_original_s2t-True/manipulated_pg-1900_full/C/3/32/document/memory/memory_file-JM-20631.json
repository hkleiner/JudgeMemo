Davis's work helped to revitalize the Hebrew language, which had been preserved as a ritual language but was not commonly spoken. The concept of a \"Chosen People\" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. The idea of special election is not unique to Judaism, as other groups, such as the Germans, have also developed similar doctrines. The section highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding the concept of a \"Chosen People\" and its implications for interfaith relations and national identity."

From the earliest literature, such as Genesis, God is shown to be a righteous and just deity who cares for all humanity, not just the Israelites. The biblical figures of Abraham, Moses, and others demonstrate a tradition of free thought and criticism of God's actions, emphasizing the importance of reason and conscience. Judaism's universal implications are evident in its acceptance of proselytes and its emphasis on the shared humanity of all people, regardless of race or nationality.

Over time, this mission evolved to become more spiritualized and universal, as seen in the writings of poets like Kipling, who presented Britain as a nation of pioneer martyrs serving a higher purpose. Ultimately, the idea of a national mission is often retrospectively constructed, with nations ascribing purposes to themselves that they were not originally conscious of, and using legend and mythology to explain and justify their achievements."

        "section_summary": "The author compares the German national anthem with a Jewish prayer, highlighting the difference between Germanism and Judaism. While German writers often glorify their nation, Jewish writers tend to rebuke theirs, seeking truth rather than heroics. The author notes that Jewish literature exposes the flaws of its own heroes, demonstrating a passion for veracity that is unique among nations. In contrast, German literature often glosses over the nation's flaws, and it is often Jewish critics, such as Maximilian Harden, who speak out against German militarism and nationalism. The author suggests that Judaism has a valuable contribution to make to the world, particularly in its emphasis on universalism and its potential to inspire a new era of peace and cooperation."

        "section_summary": "The speaker reflects on a quote from Lincoln about joining a church that values loving God and one's neighbor, and wonders what has been lacking in the Jewish community. The Jewish people have been silent for too long and must now choose to take action and make their voice heard. The speaker believes that Jews must fight for their own cause and work towards building a better world, as expressed in the poem by Nina Salaman. In the afterword, Dr. Israel Abrahams pays tribute to the memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar who was self-taught but had a great capacity for comradeship in studies. Davis' legacy lives on through his work, particularly his edition of the Festival Prayers, and through his daughters who continue his work."
