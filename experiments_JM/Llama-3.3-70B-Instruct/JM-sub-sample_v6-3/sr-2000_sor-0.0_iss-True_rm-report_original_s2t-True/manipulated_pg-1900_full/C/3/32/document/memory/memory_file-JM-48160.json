To gain access, the author seeks help from influential people, including a duchess who has established hospitals near the front lines. After a month of waiting, the author finally receives a carnet rouge, a permit that allows her to visit certain areas, but is initially only granted permission to visit Meaux and Rouen, which are not her desired destinations. She persuades the officials to consider other locations, including Bar-le-Duc, Verdun, and Nancy, but is warned that some of these areas may be too dangerous for an American lady. The author eventually visits Meaux with a French friend, where they witness the devastating aftermath of the Battle of the Marne, including vast fields of graves marked by flags and crosses."

        "section_summary": "The author met Miss Polk and Miss Ethel Crocker in Nancy, who are working with Princess Poniatowska on a project to rebuild war-torn towns in France. The author suggests that instead of rebuilding, the ruins should be left intact as a reminder of the war's destruction and a potential source of revenue from tourism. The author visited the ruined town of Gerbéviller, where they saw families living in cellars and women running businesses, and learned about the heroic Soeur Julie who saved her hospice from Prussian fury. The author was unable to visit the town of Arras due to constant bombardment, but was able to see other damaged towns and cities, including Sermaize, where some houses were spared because they were owned by Germans. The author reflects on the war's destruction and the German army's failed attempts to capture key cities, including Nancy."

Major C. attempted to secure permission for the group to visit certain towns near the front lines, but was unsuccessful. The narrator and her companions took a break to eat and rest, and she observed the conservative nature of the French people, as well as the unique individuality of the children they encountered. The group later visited the Lieutenant's home in Epernay, where they were shown a propaganda leaflet dropped by a German plane, which contained false and self-righteous claims about the French and English. The narrator and her companions were struck by the absurdity and danger of the German mindset, and they witnessed a military train passing by, carrying soldiers to the Somme."

The society, led by Mme. d'Andigné, aims to supply hospitals with delicacies such as chicken broth, fruits, and preserves, which are not provided by the military dietary kitchen. These items are essential for the recovery of wounded soldiers, who often have sensitive stomachs and cannot tolerate the standard military diet of milk and eggs. The society relies on voluntary subscriptions and donations to fund its efforts, and its work is crucial in boosting the morale and aiding the recovery of soldiers in the war zone. By providing these essential items, the society hopes to make a significant difference in the lives of wounded soldiers and support their recovery."

The author visited several military hospitals in France, where they observed the care and treatment of wounded soldiers, including the use of bathtubs to clean and refresh them before operations. The hospitals were well-run and clean, but the author notes that some smaller hospitals were in need of supplies, such as pillows. The author also highlights the generosity and gratitude of the French people, particularly the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who are working tirelessly to support the war effort despite their own financial struggles. The French people are appreciative of American support and generosity, which is helping to boost the morale and recovery of wounded soldiers."
