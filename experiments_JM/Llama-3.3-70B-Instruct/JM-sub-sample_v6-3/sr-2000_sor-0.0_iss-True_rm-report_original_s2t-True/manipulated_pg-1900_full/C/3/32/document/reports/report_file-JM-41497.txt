Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a successful portrait painter who enjoyed the patronage of high society and raised his prices as his reputation grew. He was a man of many interests and friendships, including with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke, which helped to broaden his intellectual and artistic horizons.

Section section_03 (Chars 17570–26248):
Section Summary: By 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds had established himself as a prominent painter, having painted many famous men and women of his time. He had also become a member of the Dilettanti Society and had made several pleasant journeys, including one to Devonshire with Dr. Johnson. Reynolds' studio in Leicester Square was a hub of activity, with a diverse range of sitters, including royalty, politicians, and actors, all seeking to have their portraits painted by him. Despite his success, Reynolds' paintings were not without their flaws, with many of his early works darkening and his later works cracking due to his use of experimental pigments. Overall, Reynolds' life was marked by his dedication to his art, his love of literature, and his ability to express the best in his sitters through his portraits.

Section section_04 (Chars 26249–34802):
Section Summary: After receiving a knighthood in 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds' social status and reputation continued to grow, and he became more selective with his portrait commissions.

Despite his success, Reynolds' activity as a painter came to a sudden end in 1789 when he lost the use of one eye while working at his easel. Throughout his life, Reynolds was known for his kindness, wisdom, and love of life, and he left behind a legacy of remarkable portraits and writings on art.

Section section_05 (Chars 34803–43401):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds spent his final years preparing for his death, sustained by memories of the past and surrounded by friends. He continued to work, delivering his final address to students in 1790 and sitting for a portrait by the Swedish artist von Breda. Reynolds' art was characterized by his ability to assimilate and synthesize the styles of other masters, including Titian, Rubens, and Rembrandt, and he sought to unite their excellences in his own work. Despite some limitations, Reynolds' portraits are still admired today for their beauty and technical skill, and he is considered one of the greatest masters of portraiture. Reynolds' approach to painting was analytical and diagnostic, and he brought a sense of detachment and reserve to his portrayals of women and children, often idealizing them rather than capturing their humanity.

Section section_06 (Chars 43402–46868):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children lack a sense of intimacy, suggesting he had no deep interest in them as subjects. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his exceptional skill and ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' portraits are masterful in their simplicity and directness, requiring his sitters to have strong character, whether good or bad. Unfortunately, many of his canvases have deteriorated over time, losing their original colors and harmony, but his reputation as a great artist remains unchanged. Despite some criticisms, Reynolds' name and fame continue to be a source of pride in British art and admiration worldwide.
