Section section_02 (Chars 8851–17509):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet was a philosopher-artist who focused on conveying the simplicity and hardships of rural life. His paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen" and "The Sower", showcased the loneliness and monotony of a peasant's labor, but also highlighted the importance of their work. Millet's art was not about technical skill or beauty, but about conveying a message and telling a story. He was more concerned with illustrating the human condition and the struggles of everyday life than with creating visually stunning works. Through his art, Millet aimed to make the viewer forget the painter and absorb the lesson, rather than being impressed by technical skill or artistic virtuosity.

Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, making it difficult for innovative artists to break through.

His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing significant roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, encouraged by his family, and eventually began to pursue art seriously.

Section section_04 (Chars 26478–35291):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father recognized his son's artistic talent and took him to meet a painter in Cherbourg, where he began to study art. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to support his move to Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre and developed his own unique style. In Paris, Millet briefly studied with Delaroche, but found the experience unsatisfying and eventually struck out on his own, determined to develop his art despite the challenges of poverty and criticism. Freed from the influence of others, Millet was now able to work towards establishing his own artistic identity and achieving recognition.
