Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" introduced the author to the concept of evolution and the idea that progress is a universal law that applies to all aspects of existence. The essay explains that progress is the result of differentiation, where simple things become complex through successive changes, and that this process is driven by the principle that every active force produces more than one change. The author notes that Spencer's work has had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and that his ideas have been widely assimilated into modern scientific thought. Overall, Spencer's philosophy of science emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the universal laws that govern their development."

He believed in the universality of law, applying to both the physical and mental realms, and that everything can be explained in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, Spencer also acknowledged the existence of an \"Unknowable\" or \"Unconditioned Reality\" that underlies all phenomena, which he saw as the ultimate source of all existence and activity. This concept is central to his philosophy, but its ambiguity and vagueness have led to criticism and confusion. Ultimately, Spencer's idea of the Unknowable differs from the scientific perspective, which avoids questions of ultimate origin and instead focuses on explaining phenomena within an orderly scheme."

Spencer distinguishes between the knowable effects of natural phenomena and their unknowable cause or source, which he calls the Unknowable. Bergson, on the other hand, draws a distinction between \"the evolved\" and \"evolution itself,\" and attributes the agency of evolution to Life. Both thinkers agree that the intellect can only provide a world of symbols, and that the ultimate reality or source of evolution can only be known through intuition. The discussion highlights the similarities and differences between Spencer's and Bergson's philosophical ideas, with both seeking to understand the source of change and evolution in the world."

In science, the concept of cause can be replaced by the idea of relatedness and change, where the co-presence of things in a certain relationship implies certain motions and changes. The concept of energy is also reevaluated, with some arguing that it is not an active agent that produces change, but rather a constant ratio of variables that describes the changes themselves. The idea of \"force\" is also examined, and it is suggested that it can be understood as a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness among things, rather than a causal agent. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the meaning of these concepts and remove ambiguity in order to better understand the world and the changes that occur within it."

The author identifies three main types of relatedness: physico-chemical, vital, and cognitive, each with its own unique properties that emerge through evolution. As new modes of relatedness occur, new constitutive properties emerge that are not simply the sum of the properties of the component parts. This concept is referred to as \"evolution\" and implies that there is more in the world today than there was in the beginning, not in terms of matter and energy, but in terms of varied relationships and new properties. The author suggests that these new properties are constitutive and characterize the higher evolutionary products, but science is unable to explain why they are so."

However, Spencer later recognized the limitations of a purely mechanical interpretation of nature, acknowledging the presence of specific vital characters in living organisms that cannot be conceived in physico-chemical terms. Spencer's view of cognition emphasizes the complex relationship between the organism and the environment, but his terminology and distinctions between internal and external relations are sometimes ambiguous. A truly scientific interpretation of cognitive relatedness is still lacking, and Spencer's work does not provide an adequate analysis of this complex problem. Ultimately, a scientific philosophy must deal with cognitive relatedness in a strictly analogous manner to other relational problems, without resorting to unscientific concepts like psychic entities or vital forces."
