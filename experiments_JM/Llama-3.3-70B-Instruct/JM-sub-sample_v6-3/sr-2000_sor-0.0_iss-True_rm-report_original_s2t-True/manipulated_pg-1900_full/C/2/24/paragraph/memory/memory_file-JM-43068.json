        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Elder, who is now recognized as one of the greatest masters of peasant painting. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are infused with a deep understanding of the struggles and troubles of the peasants he depicted. His unique style, which is marked by subtlety and restraint, is a result of his simple and earnest life, as well as his study of the Italian Renaissance masters. Overall, Millet's work is a powerful and enduring portrayal of peasant life, and his paintings continue to be appreciated for their intense earnestness and melancholy truth."

His paintings, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", showcased the loneliness and monotony of a peasant's labor, but also highlighted the importance of their work. Millet's art was not about technical skill or virtuosity, but about conveying a message and telling a story. He was inspired by the everyday life of peasants and the changing seasons, particularly spring, which symbolized new life and renewal. Overall, Millet's art was a reflection of his philosophical observations on life, and his brush was a means to an end, used to illustrate his thoughts and ideas."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art. His childhood was marked by a strong connection to nature and a simple, hardworking lifestyle, which would later influence his artistic style. Millet's early life was spent working on his family's farm, where he developed his observational skills and began to draw the people and objects around him. He eventually developed a passion for art, laying the foundation for his future career as a leading figure in the modern naturalistic school."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm to manage it, but he eventually returned to Cherbourg to pursue his art studies under M. Langlois. Langlois, who had a classical influence, tried to mold Millet's style, but Millet struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a modest pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a significant influence on his development. Millet eventually placed himself under the tutelage of Delaroche, but found his style and teachings to be unsuitable, leading him to cease attending the studio and strike out on his own once again."

He eventually moved to Barbizon, where he found inspiration in the peasant life and landscape, and began to develop his unique style. Millet's art career was marked by struggles, including poverty and rejection by the Salon, but he persevered and continued to produce works that showcased his talent. He was joined in Barbizon by other artists, including Rousseau, with whom he shared a passion for art but differed in style and subject matter. Ultimately, Millet found success and recognition in Barbizon, where he could focus on his beloved subjects of peasant life and landscape."
