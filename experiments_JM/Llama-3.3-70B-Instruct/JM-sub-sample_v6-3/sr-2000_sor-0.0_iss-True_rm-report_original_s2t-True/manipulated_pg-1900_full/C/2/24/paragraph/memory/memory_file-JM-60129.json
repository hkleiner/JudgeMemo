The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their language and culture showed similarities to Khirgis and Turkish, but they had no written language or recorded history."

The lamas are simple and poor, with limited knowledge of the Tangutan language and no involvement in medicine, instead relying on fortune-tellers to predict the future and pray for the sick.
