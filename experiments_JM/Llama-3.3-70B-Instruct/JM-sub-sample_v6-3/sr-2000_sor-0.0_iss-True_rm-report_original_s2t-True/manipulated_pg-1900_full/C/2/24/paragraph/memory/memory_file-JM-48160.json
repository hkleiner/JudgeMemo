        "section_summary": "The author visited several military hospitals in France and was impressed by their cleanliness, organization, and care for the wounded soldiers. Despite some shortages, such as pillows, the hospitals were well-run and the patients were well-cared for, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the hospital wards and boost morale. The author met with Mlle. de Sézilles, the infirmière major, who showed her around the Hôpital Central and highlighted the importance of appetizing food and comfortable surroundings for the convalescent soldiers. The author also noted that the wealthy in France were not as able to support relief efforts as they once were, due to the economic strain of the war, and therefore relied on international support. The author appeals to readers to contribute to the relief efforts, emphasizing the gratitude of the French soldiers and the importance of supporting \"The Eternal France\"."
