Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with evidence of Roman occupation, including roads, buildings, and artifacts. The Romans called the city Durovernum, and it was an important center, but it was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Anglo-Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral."

In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered attacks from the Danes, including a devastating raid in 1011, but it continued to grow and prosper, with the cathedral being rebuilt and the city remaining a major center of Christianity."

The new cathedral, completed in 1077, was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Years later, in 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in the cathedral by four knights, an event that made Canterbury a famous resort for pilgrims. The murder occurred after a long struggle between Becket and King Henry II, and it was sparked by a confrontation between Becket and the four knights, who had been sent by the king. The cathedral, with its Norman architecture, became a significant site for pilgrims and a testament to the city's rich history."

The knights, fueled by fury and a desire for revenge, attacked and killed Becket with multiple sword strokes. Despite being a divisive figure in life, Becket was quickly revered as a saint and martyr, with his blood and relics believed to have healing properties. King Henry II, who had inadvertently provoked the murder, later performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and receiving physical punishment from bishops and monks to atone for his role in Becket's death. This act of penance was seen as a way for Henry to appease God and restore his reputation, and he believed it contributed to his subsequent military successes."

A fire in 1174 damaged the cathedral, and it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, which combined Romanesque and Gothic elements. The cathedral was further modified over the centuries, with additions such as the shrine of Becket and the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style. Canterbury became a major center of ecclesiastical power and a popular destination for pilgrims and royal visitors, but its decline began with the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of Becket's shrine. The city's historic architecture and rich history have been preserved, and it remains a significant and fascinating destination to this day."
