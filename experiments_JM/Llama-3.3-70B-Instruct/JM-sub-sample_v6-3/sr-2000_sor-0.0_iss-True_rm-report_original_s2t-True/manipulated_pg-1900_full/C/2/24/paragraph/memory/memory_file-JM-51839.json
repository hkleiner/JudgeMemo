According to legend, the city was founded by a Caddo chief's twin sons, Natchitoches and Nacogdoches, who were instructed to build their homes and rear their tribes in different directions. The area was later visited by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle, and was also influenced by the Christian teachings of Mother Maria de Jesus de Agreda. The first permanent European settlement in Nacogdoches was established in 1716 by Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus, who founded the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches. The city has since been shaped by the interactions of Native American, Spanish, and French cultures, leaving behind a legacy of historic sites and landmarks."

The town grew rapidly and became a key location in the region, with Ybarbo serving as its leader until he was removed from office in 1792. In the early 19th century, Nacogdoches was involved in several significant events, including the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition and the Mexican Revolution against Spain. The town was also a hub for various expeditions and schemes, including the formation of the Republic of Texas, led by Dr. James Long in 1819. During this time, Nacogdoches was a center of activity, with multiple newspapers being published and various leaders vying for control of the region."

After the failure, Nacogdoches regained its prestige under the leadership of Alcalde James Dill, and American settlers began to arrive under the new Mexican government's colonization laws. However, tensions rose between Americans, Mexicans, and Cherokee Indians, leading to the Fredonian War in 1826, which resulted in the expulsion of prominent citizens. The Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution, as American settlers defeated the Mexican army, leading to the expulsion of Mexican troops from the territory east of San Antonio. This battle paved the way for the Texans to hold their Convention without interference, further solidifying American influence in the region."

Nacogdoches played a significant role in the revolution, with many of its citizens, including Sam Houston and Thomas J. Rusk, holding key positions in the new government. After the revolution, the town experienced a period of expansion, with the establishment of new towns and businesses, and became a hub for politics and commerce in the new Republic of Texas. The town's growth and influence were shaped by its prominent citizens, including leaders, businessmen, and politicians who played important roles in the development of the region."

The town suffered significantly during the Civil War, but began to recover with the arrival of the railroad, which brought new business and growth. The establishment of Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College after World War I further contributed to the town's prosperity and cultural development. Today, Nacogdoches is a thriving city with a rich history, having been under nine different flags throughout its existence."
