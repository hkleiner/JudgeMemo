They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. After arriving in Battersea, they try to find the dog home, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful, and they are misled by a street boy. They then spot an official from the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they continue to follow the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart."
