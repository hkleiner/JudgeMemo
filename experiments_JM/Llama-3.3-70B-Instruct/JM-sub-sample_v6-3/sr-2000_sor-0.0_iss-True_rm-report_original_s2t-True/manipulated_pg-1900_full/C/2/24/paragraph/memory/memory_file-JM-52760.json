Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy called for a two-pronged attack, with General Ulysses S. Grant leading the effort against Richmond and Petersburg, while General William T. Sherman marched towards Atlanta. Grant's army clashed with Confederate forces in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately failed to capture Richmond. The Union army then turned its attention to Petersburg, a vital transportation hub and supply center for the Confederacy, in an effort to isolate and capture the city, which would likely lead to the fall of Richmond."

The city's defenses, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates, led by General Beauregard, were initially outnumbered but received reinforcements from General Lee, and the battle continued for several days with intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces ultimately failed to break through the Confederate lines, and the battle became a prolonged siege of the city."

Despite this, the Union army continued to extend their lines and cut off supply routes, with the ultimate goal of capturing Petersburg through a process of attrition. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including former coal miners, devised a plan to dig a mine shaft under the Confederate lines and blow it up, which became known as the Battle of the Crater. The Union army spent several weeks digging the mine, using improvised tools and a clever ventilation system to overcome the challenges of digging a long tunnel."

The explosion created a large crater, but the Union charge that followed was delayed and disorganized, allowing the Confederates to rally and counterattack. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederates, led by Brig. Gen. William Mahone, were able to drive the Union troops back and eventually retake the crater. The Union army suffered heavy losses, with over 4,000 men killed, wounded, or captured, while the Confederates lost around 1,500 men. The battle was a decisive Confederate victory, with the Union army failing to achieve a breakthrough despite their initial advantage."

The Union army's relentless advance forced the Confederates to extend their defense lines, making them thinner and more vulnerable.

He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union fort near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through the Union lines and facilitate a retreat.
