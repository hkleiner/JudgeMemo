Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but later feels uncertain about its quality, especially after Corvick expresses his dissatisfaction with it. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, where Lady Jane praises the review and tries to get Vereker to read it, but he politely declines, taking the paper to read later. The narrator is left feeling anxious about Vereker's opinion of his review and unsure if he has truly understood the author's work."

        "section_summary": "The narrator reflects on a conversation with a man whose wife had knowledge of a secret about Hugh Vereker, but had not shared it with her husband. The narrator reveals to the man that his wife had told him about the secret, causing the man to become pale and distraught. The narrator then shares the story of how he discovered the secret, and the man listens with deepening attention, revealing that he would have been worthy of his wife's trust. The man's initial shock gives way to waves of wonder and curiosity, and the narrator notes that they are now both driven by an unappeased desire to uncover the truth. The narrator finds some consolation in the man's similar state of obsession, almost seeing it as a form of revenge."
