        "section_summary": "In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to the Egyptian court and administration. The tablets also revealed the complex system of writing and diplomacy used by the ancient Egyptians and their counterparts in Asia, with scribes using various scripts and languages to communicate."

He introduced a new doctrine, known as the Aten dogma, which was based on the worship of the sun disk and was seen as heretical by the traditional priests. The king's efforts led to a break with the old religion, and he established a new capital, Akhet-Aten, which was consecrated before it was even finished. The Asiatic provinces, which were under Egyptian supremacy, enjoyed self-government, but this led to constant struggles and conflicts between the native princes and chiefs, who were also affected by the immigration of Bedaw√¨n tribes. The Egyptian government struggled to maintain control and collect tribute, often responding with inadequate military force, which ultimately led to further instability and conflict in the region."

Meanwhile, Akhenaten had taken some of his father's archives to his new capital, which included letters from foreign sovereigns, such as the Babylonian ruler Kadashman-Bel, who addressed the Pharaoh by his prenomen \"Nimmuria\". These letters reveal that the Egyptian king was reluctant to give away his daughters in marriage to foreign kings, and instead preferred to keep them within the royal family. King Tushratta of Mitani, on the other hand, formed an alliance with Egypt through marriage, sending his predecessors' daughters to the Pharaoh's harem, and later requesting gifts and promises from Nimmuria. The letters between these kings demonstrate the diplomatic relationships and negotiations between ancient kingdoms, with requests for gold, marriage alliances, and declarations of affection and brotherhood."

The relationships between these rulers are further complicated by the involvement of other kingdoms, including Babylonia and Assyria, and the exchange of gifts and messengers. Napkhuria's behavior is seen as inexperienced and reckless, leading to strained relations with other kingdoms.

The king of Mitani, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, rather than just for material gain. The Mitani kingdom eventually vanished, replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms, while Assyria seized its eastern boundary. The Egyptian XVIIIth Dynasty also faced a swift downfall, with the city of Tell el Amarna being razed to the ground after the death of King Napkhuria in 1370 B.C."
