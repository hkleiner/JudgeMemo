Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style that was bold, free, and exuberant. The chapter \"The Boy Printer of Ishpeming\" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, from his early days in Lynn, Massachusetts, to his move to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he developed a passion for art and printing. Bradley's early life was marked by curiosity and creativity, with a strong desire to learn and become an artist. Through his determination and talent, Bradley went on to become a pioneering figure in American graphic design, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire new generations of artists."

This experience had a profound influence on his approach to typography, and he soon became a member of the Arts and Crafts Society of Boston. The author's use of Caslon type in his printing work, including his magazine \"Bradley: His Book,\" helped to revive interest in this classic typeface, which had fallen out of favor. He established the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, with the goal of producing high-quality, aesthetically pleasing publications. The press's first project was a sample book for the Strathmore Paper Company, which marked a new approach to showcasing paper samples and helped to establish the Wayside Press as a innovative force in the printing industry."

The author notes that today's young designers and printers have greater opportunities than they did in the late Victorian period, thanks to advances in typography, mechanical printing, and other technologies. With access to better training and resources, young designers can now create high-quality work that was not possible in the past. The author concludes by looking back on their own career, which spanned many years and included numerous achievements in design and printing."

He went on to work with prominent publications, including the Ladies' Home Journal and Collier's, and later transitioned to the motion picture industry. Bradley's work was celebrated in a 1954 portfolio, which was introduced at a luncheon sponsored by the Typophiles and Strathmore. The book about Bradley's life was assembled from his own writings, which were edited and connected into a narrative by others, including Peter Beilenson, who contributed to the design and printing of the book. Bradley's legacy is preserved in comprehensive collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Huntington Library, showcasing his colorful and innovative designs."
