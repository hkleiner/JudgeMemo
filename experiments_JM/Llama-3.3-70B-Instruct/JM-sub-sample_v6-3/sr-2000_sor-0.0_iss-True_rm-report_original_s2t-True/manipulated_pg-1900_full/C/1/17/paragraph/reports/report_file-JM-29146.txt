Section section_01 (Chars 0–8081):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially and has a family to support. Englander is worried about his future and that of his family, but Ramsey tries to reassure him by claiming he has some savings to fall back on. The situation is dire, with the Irwadian government seeking to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal, and only allowing Irwadian pilots to operate.

Section section_02 (Chars 8082–16018):
Section Summary: Ramsey lends 375 credits to his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and tells him to pay him back whenever he can. Later, Ramsey visits a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi, where he encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Security Police. Symm, who is hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen, insults Ramsey and tells him to leave, eventually sloshing a drink in his face. Ramsey, aware that he is in a precarious situation, chooses not to react aggressively, despite being insulted. The encounter highlights the tensions between Earthmen and Irwadians, with the latter resenting the former's economic and military power in the galaxy.

Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an administrator, encounters Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, who is drunk and harassing a Vegan girl, Mith Vegan.

They go to Ramsey's room in the Old Quarter, where they find an unexpected guest, an Earthgirl who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl, who is provocatively dressed, seems to know Ramsey and can read his mind, leaving him with limited options. Ramsey and the Vegan girl are now in a precarious situation, with Symm likely to come after them and the Earthgirl's intentions unclear.

Section Summary: Captain Ramsey meets a beautiful Earthgirl named Margot Dennison, a former tri-di star, who offers him a job to pilot her ship through hyper-space to Centauri in exchange for 1,000 credits. Ramsey agrees, on the condition that a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After spending the night in Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has disappeared, leaving them locked in. Ramsey searches the apartment, finding it furnished in a feminine style, but discovers no evidence of Margot's acting career on Irwadi. He does, however, find a mysterious letter in one of the compartments, which piques his interest.

Section section_05 (Chars 31945–40358):
Section Summary: Ramsey found a letter in Margot Dennison's apartment that seemed important to her, and as he read it, he discovered that it was from her father, who was dying of cancer. The letter spoke of a "proto-man" and a hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which could hold the key to immense power and influence in the galaxy. Margot's father had been searching for this secret and wanted Margot to continue his work, but warned her that presenting the information to scientists would be met with laughter and disbelief. Ramsey was perplexed by the letter and its references to proto-man and hyper-space, and he was soon joined by Margot, who had returned to the apartment. The two of them were on the run, with a wanted bulletin issued for their arrest, and they planned to work on a ship in a nearby Spacer Graveyard to make their escape.

Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are working on a 50-year-old Canopusian freighter in the Spacer Graveyard, trying to repair it to escape. Margot, who can read minds, senses that they are being watched, and Ramsey is anxious, trying to hide his thoughts and feelings from her. Meanwhile, Security Officer Ramar Chind reports to his boss, Garr Symm, who wants to let the trio escape so they can be followed, as they may lead them to something of immense importance found in Margot's apartment. Symm orders Chind to plant a fuel supply in one of the wrecks to aid their escape. The true purpose of their mission is not clear, but it seems to be connected to a letter that could give Irwadi a dominant position in the galaxy.

Section Summary: The Enterprise, piloted by Ramsey, is being followed by the Dog Star, crewed by Ramar Chind and Garr Symm. Margot Dennison, a passenger on the Enterprise, discovers that Ramsey knows about her father's letter and the existence of a world in hyper-space, which is said to be the home of proto-man. She forces Ramsey to land the ship on this world, despite his warnings about meddling with a power beyond human understanding. The ship lands, but the environment is hostile, with extreme cold and no atmosphere, making it impossible for Margot to explore outside without a spacesuit. Garr Symm, meanwhile, is hesitant to follow the Enterprise, due to a deep-seated fear that he believes may be an inherited response to the concept of proto-man.

Section section_09 (Chars 64904–72912):
Section Summary: Ramsey is struggling to think clearly, but Margot's presence helps him to focus and consider the possibility of going outside into the harsh environment of the timeless world. He realizes that the absence of time would protect them from the cold and lack of air, and Margot decides to go outside, intending to take Vardin with her. However, Ramsey eventually agrees to go with them, and they exit the ship, hearing a beautiful, un-Earthly music that seems to be the "Music of the Spheres". As they stand outside, the fog begins to clear, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot identifies as a matter transmitter, a device that could enable instantaneous travel across space. The group stands in awe, waiting to see what will happen next as the device begins to open.

Section Summary: As Margot approaches the mysterious box, Ramsey has a vision of her playing a cosmic game of chess, symbolizing the power of matter-transmission that could determine the fate of the galaxy. He tries to stop her, but Garr Symm intervenes, and despite Ramsey's efforts, Symm jumps into the box, which seems to have a profound effect on him, regressing him to a primitive state. Vardin, a proto-human, reveals that her ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, and she has been trying to prevent humans from accessing it. Ramsey and Margot escape, and as they leave the planet, Vardin disappears, having completed her mission to protect humanity from the dangers of matter-transmission. In the end, Margot and Ramsey find love for each other, and they blast off into space together.
