        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a true bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A bookman is born, not made, and is characterized by a deep love and appreciation for books, rather than just possessing them for show or financial gain. The author illustrates this point with a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, ornate bookcase, but is not a true bookman because he keeps his books locked away behind glass doors. In contrast, a true bookman values access to and intimacy with their books, and is often drawn to rare and unique volumes. The author also touches on the idea that some books are classics, standing the test of time and offering wisdom and inspiration to readers across generations."

He values books that are well-written and bring the past to life, and is not concerned with whether the writer's views are respectable or accurate. The bookman's love affair with literature began with classic novels like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\", and he later discovered authors like Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens. He returns to these favorite authors again and again, finding comfort and pleasure in their works. The bookman also admires French literature, particularly Balzac, who he considers the master of the realistic school and a founder of the art."

The concept of the \"swinging pendulum\" in history is discussed, where every idea or institution eventually gives way to its opposite. The writer also waxes poetic about the joys of book collecting and rearranging one's library, finding delight in the process of rediscovering old favorites and reminiscing about the past. A fantasy gathering of book lovers is imagined, featuring historical figures such as Cosmo Medici and Mary Queen of Scots, who would come together to share their passion for books. The writer's love of literature and books is evident throughout, as they celebrate the timeless beauty of great writing."

It tells the story of a bookman who is infected with the \"book disease\" from his father and becomes obsessed with collecting rare and valuable books. The bookman will make sacrifices to obtain the books he desires, and his love for books is compared to a disease that cannot be cured. The passage also touches on the idea that book lovers will go to great lengths to acquire the books they want, often justifying their purchases as a way to build a legacy for their families. Ultimately, the bookman's obsession with books is portrayed as a charming and relatable quirk."
