To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber and impressive sight."

The narrator had difficulty finding the Hotel du Commerce, but eventually arrived and was treated indifferently by the staff, who were busy catering to the many officers staying there. The dining room was crowded, dirty, and infested with flies, which the narrator imagined had come from the battlefields of Verdun.

The narrator then waited at the train station, where they witnessed a chaotic scene with soldiers and a drunken Algerian soldier, but remained calm and unaffected due to the desensitizing atmosphere of the war zone. Ultimately, they found a way to wait for their train on the platform, despite initial refusal from a petty official, and waited anxiously as the hour of 5 approached, when bombs were often dropped."

The narrator noted that the roads were in surprisingly good condition and that many soldiers seemed to be loafing, waiting to be called to the front. The trip provided the narrator with a unique perspective on the war zone, one that was different from what they would have seen by train."
