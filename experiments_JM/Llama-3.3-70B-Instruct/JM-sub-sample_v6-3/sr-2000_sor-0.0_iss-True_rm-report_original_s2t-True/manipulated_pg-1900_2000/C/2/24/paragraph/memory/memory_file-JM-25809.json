He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. He reads a letter from his sweetheart, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, which further adds to his despair. Jim's friend, Bud, the mail-carrier, arrives and tries to cheer him up, suggesting he take a break and go to town to have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too down and also mindful of Anne's expectations. Jim is deeply in love with Anne and hopes to one day be able to provide for her and make her happy."

Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him to ride. Bud agrees and tells Jim about his recent encounter with a humpbacked man who tried to rob him, but only got $10. After returning with the burro, Bud teases Jim about his new \"thoroughbred\" and the two friends prepare to part ways at the fork in the trail. Jim tries to thank Bud, but he brushes off the gratitude."
