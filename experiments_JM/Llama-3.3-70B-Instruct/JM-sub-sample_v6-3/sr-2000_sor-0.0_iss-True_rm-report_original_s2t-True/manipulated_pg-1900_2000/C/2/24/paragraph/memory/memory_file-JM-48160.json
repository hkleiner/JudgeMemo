        "section_summary": "The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After waiting nearly a month, the author finally received a permit, but it was not for the location she desired, Amiens, which was too close to the front lines. Instead, she was allowed to visit other base hospitals, including Meaux, where she witnessed the impressive and somber sight of the battlefield of the Marne. The author was determined to see more of the war zone, and her permit, known as a carnet rouge, would allow her to visit other locations, although some, like Verdun, were considered too dangerous for an American lady."

The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, listening to constant shellfire overhead. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Ch√¢lons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter of introduction to facilitate their trip. They traveled to these destinations, observing many soldiers at the train station and on military trains, and were struck by the height and confidence of the French officers they met. The narrator was eager to experience the reality of war firsthand, having been sheltered in Paris for three months."
