Section section_01 (Chars 0–8099):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is temporarily grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot license. The Irwadian government's move is seen as a power play to control the supply of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially, and offers to help him out with some credits. The situation on Irwadi is dire for non-Irwadian pilots like Ramsey and Englander, who must find a way to leave the planet and pursue other opportunities in the galaxy.

Section section_02 (Chars 8100–13144):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is ill, and gives him 375 credits to support his family. Englander is grateful, and Ramsey tells him to be careful with the money and not to gamble it away. Later, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter, but has a bad night and loses most of his money. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, dressed in flashy jewelry, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent.
