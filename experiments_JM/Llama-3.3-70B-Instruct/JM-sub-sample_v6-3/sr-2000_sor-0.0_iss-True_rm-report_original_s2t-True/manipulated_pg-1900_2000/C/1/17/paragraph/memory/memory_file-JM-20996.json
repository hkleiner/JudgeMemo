This event marked an epoch in history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to bring benefits to the conquered. The group traveled from San Francisco, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's beauty and culture, including visiting the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. As they crossed the International Date Line, they lost a day and celebrated with the traditional \"Revels of Neptune\". The group eventually arrived in Manila, where they navigated the rough waters of Manila Bay and were introduced to the local natives."

In contrast, it also discusses the development of art, citing the example of an artist who learned from others and honed his skills through dedication and technique. The city of Manila is also described, with its old and new parts, and its history of being protected by a wall from invaders. The scene is set with a bustling bridge, where people from various cultures and professions are moving about, creating a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The section also touches on the experiences of a group of teachers awaiting assignment in Manila, who receive a surprise notice with instructions to prepare for their postings."
