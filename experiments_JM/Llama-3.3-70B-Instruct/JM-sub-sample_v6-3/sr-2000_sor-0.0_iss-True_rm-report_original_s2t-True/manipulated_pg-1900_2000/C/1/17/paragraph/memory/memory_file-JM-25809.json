He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he's starting to lose hope. Jim is also troubled by a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability. As he sits there, feeling defeated, the mail-carrier, Bud, arrives and asks about Jim's progress, but Jim is pessimistic about finding gold. The scene is set for Jim's disappointment and frustration to continue, with his personal and professional struggles intertwining."

However, Jim declines, citing that he is \"busted\" and instead asks Bud to help him get a burro from a nearby herd. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim prepares to ride, tying a gunny sack to the animal. Before they part ways, Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but was only given $10 and warned not to bother Bud again. Jim and his new burro mount set off together, with Jim trying to thank Bud for his help."
