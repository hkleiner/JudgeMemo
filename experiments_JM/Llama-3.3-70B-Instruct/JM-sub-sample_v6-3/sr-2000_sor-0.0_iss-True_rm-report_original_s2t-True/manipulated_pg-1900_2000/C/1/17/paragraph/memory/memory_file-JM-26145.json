        "section_summary": "In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets were found to be from the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from Asiatic invaders and expanded its kingdom into Asia and Nubia. Amenophis IV introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, moving towards monotheism and worship of the sun disk, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes. The discovery of the tablets has provided valuable insights into the history and administration of Ancient Egypt during this period."

        "section_summary": "The Egyptian king changed his name to \"Akhen-Aten\" and introduced a new religion, with his courtiers and family members also adopting names related to the sun god Aten. The new capital, \"Akhet-Aten\", was built and consecrated, and the queen-mother Teye showed respect to her son's new beliefs by visiting the city. In contrast, the working class in England during the early 19th century faced extreme poverty and hardship, with many being illiterate and inarticulate. The government struggled to address these issues, implementing flawed solutions such as the system of doles, which ultimately worsened the situation. Meanwhile, in Paris, a young girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was born, destined to play a significant role in French history."
