Section section_01 (Chars 0–8463):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, feeling that the holiday has lost some of its original magic and excitement. In the past, Christmas was a time of great anticipation and joy, with a unique romantic quality that made even the most mundane tasks enjoyable. However, the author believes that today, people have to force themselves to get into the holiday spirit, and that the celebration has become somewhat artificial and lacking in genuine sentiment. The author suggests that children's enthusiasm for Christmas is a reflection of how adults used to feel about the holiday, and that the old Christmas hymns still evoke a sense of passion and faith that is missing from modern celebrations. Overall, the author is lamenting the loss of Christmas's original charm and authenticity.

Section section_02 (Chars 8463–12104):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who prioritized truth and skepticism over faith and tradition. Their discoveries and ideas led to an age of doubt, causing people to question and eventually dismiss long-held beliefs. As a result, faith and sentimentality have become undervalued, leaving people feeling lost and uncertain. Despite this, people still try to keep the Christmas spirit alive, suggesting that a deep-seated instinct reminds them of its importance. The author suggests that this instinct is a profound reminder that, without the Christmas spirit, people are lost and in need of something to believe in.
