        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary education, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen due to their wealth or social status, but lack a genuine love for reading and literature. Ultimately, a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless, meaningful works of literature."

        "section_summary": "The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and classic. A true classic is one that has enriched the human mind, spoken to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcended the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author believes that a critic's role is to distinguish between books that are merely entertaining and those that have lasting value. Ultimately, a book's subject matter is less important than its literary quality, and a true book lover will appreciate great works regardless of their personal beliefs or preferences."
