        "section_summary": "Jean Fran√ßois Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. Millet's style is influenced by the Dutch masters, particularly Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and the Italian Renaissance, and his paintings are marked by their incisive truth and absorbing sincerity. His depiction of peasant life is tinged with melancholy and fervor, reflecting his own struggles and temperament. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus\", are not sentimental but rather a truthful representation of the simple and devout life of peasants, and their subtleties can only be fully appreciated by those familiar with the countryside he painted. Overall, Millet's unique style and approach to painting have secured his place as a great master of peasant painting."

        "section_summary": "Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in \"La Baigneuse,\" his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and simplicity of rural life, often focusing on the loneliness and hardships of the peasant's labor. His work reveals a philosophical mind that grappled with the problems of life, and his interest in the everyday lives of peasants is evident in his paintings, drawings, and etchings. Overall, Millet's art is marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep understanding of the human experience."
