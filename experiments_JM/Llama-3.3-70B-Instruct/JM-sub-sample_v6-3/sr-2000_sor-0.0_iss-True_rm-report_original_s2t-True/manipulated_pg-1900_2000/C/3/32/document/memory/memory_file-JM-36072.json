        "section_summary": "The Victorian Age was a time of significant change, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which broke the continuity between the old order and the new. The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a stable equilibrium, where the masses had no voice in government but had a stake in the country. The aristocracy held political power and were highly cultivated, enlightened patrons of literature and art. The French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a period of isolation in England, causing a delay in democratic reforms and a shift in cultural influences from France to Germany."

        "section_summary": "The war did not significantly disrupt the intellectual life of the country, with notable literary figures like Scott, Wordsworth, and Jane Austen continuing to produce great works. In contrast, the condition of the working class was very bad, with poverty, illiteracy, and poor living conditions prevalent. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises, which were exacerbated by over-population and a low standard of civilization. Despite these difficulties, the country experienced rapid progress in the first half of the reign, with improvements in education, liberty, and economic growth. This progress was marked by a sense of complacency, with many writers and thinkers of the time celebrating the country's advancements and optimistic about its future."
