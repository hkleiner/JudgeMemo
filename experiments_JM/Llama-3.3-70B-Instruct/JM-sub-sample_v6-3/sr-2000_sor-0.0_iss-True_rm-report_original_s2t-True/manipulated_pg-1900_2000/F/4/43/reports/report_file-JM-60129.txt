Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, and left the Chinese town of Chint'a, heading southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team encountered a village called Machuangtzu, inhabited by people who called themselves Sarö Yögur, or "yellow Yögurs", who had a distinct culture and language. According to legend, the Sarö Yögur people originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and migrated to their current location to escape disease or other factors. The village had a small, poorly used temple, and the lamas who lived there earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, with minimal contributions from the villagers. The Sarö Yögur people had a unique language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but had no written language and were reluctant to share their history, songs, or legends with the expedition team.

Section section_02 (Chars 8356–12747):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style homes with Buddhist altars and heated sleeping stoves. Their household items and clothing are largely of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences, and are often made from home-spun materials. The women's traditional head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, coral, and copper rings, and are worn from marriage until death. The Sarö Yögur people have limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items during the cold season. They engage in some handicrafts, including weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men performing other tasks like basket-making.
