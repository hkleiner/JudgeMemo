Section section_01 (Chars 0–8726):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and military efforts, including the Brusilov offensive, saved Italy and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme and at Verdun. Germany's plan to win the war, led by Field Marshal Moltke, was nearly successful, but Russia's and France's efforts prevented a German victory. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was crucial, and its losses and sacrifices paved the way for the eventual defeat of Prussian militarism.

Section section_02 (Chars 8726–13144):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, relied on concentrating all forces against France, but this plan was foiled when Russia unexpectedly rushed into East Prussia, diverting German troops and preventing a potential German victory. The Russian Army's self-sacrifice during the early days of the war played a crucial role in the Allied cause, as it forced Germany to divide its forces and ultimately led to the failure of the German plan. Despite this, the true historic role of Russia in the war is often obscured, and some, like General Ludendorf, have attempted to discredit Russia's contributions through false data and distorted perspectives. Ludendorf's memoirs, in particular, have been criticized for their inaccuracies and misleading portrayal of the Russian Army's actions. The Russian Army's sacrifices and efforts were instrumental in the war, and it is essential to recognize their significance in the Allied victory.
