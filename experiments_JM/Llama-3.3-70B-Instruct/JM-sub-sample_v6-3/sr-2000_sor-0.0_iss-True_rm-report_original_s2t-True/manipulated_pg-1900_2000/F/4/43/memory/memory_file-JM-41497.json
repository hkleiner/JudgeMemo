        "section_summary": "Joshua Reynolds was a talented and determined individual who was born with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common-sense, which enabled him to achieve great success in his career as a painter. He was not a genius, but rather a clever and hardworking young man who was determined to make a name for himself in the art world. Reynolds' time in Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, was instrumental in shaping his technique and style, and he never forgot the debt he owed to the art of the old masters. Upon his return to England, Reynolds established himself as a prominent portrait painter, and his studio quickly gained popularity, thanks in part to the support of his patron, Lord Edgcumbe. Despite facing some physical challenges, including deafness and facial scars, Reynolds went on to become a leading figure in the English art world, playing a key role in the founding of the Royal Academy."

        "section_summary": "Joshua Reynolds quickly gained success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. As his career progressed, he moved to larger studios, raised his prices, and became a prominent figure in society. Reynolds was not only a talented artist but also a man of the world, who chose his friends wisely and was inspired by the company of notable individuals such as Dr. Johnson and Edmund Burke. However, he also had his flaws, including a touch of snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which he partly overcame through his associations with refined and distinguished people. Despite his imperfections, Reynolds remains an interesting and accomplished figure, both as an artist and as a person."
