        "section_summary": "By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to the siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key step towards ending the war, as it would cut off Richmond's supplies and likely lead to the city's abandonment."

        "section_summary": "Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" was constructed around Petersburg, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line's length and size proved to be a disadvantage, requiring more troops to defend it than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River to face a significantly smaller Confederate force under General Beauregard."
