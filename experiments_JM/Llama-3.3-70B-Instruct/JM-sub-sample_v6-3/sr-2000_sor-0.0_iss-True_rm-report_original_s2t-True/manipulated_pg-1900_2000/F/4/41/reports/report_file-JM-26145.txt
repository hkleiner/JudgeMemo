Section section_01 (Chars 0–8315):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The tablets provide valuable insights into the administration and court of the Egyptian pharaohs during this period, including their relationships with other kingdoms and their internal affairs.

Section section_02 (Chars 8316–12794):
Section Summary: The Egyptian king, Amenophis IV, later known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion that worshipped the sun disk, Aten, as the chief deity. He attempted to reform the traditional Egyptian religion, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, leading to open strife and the eventual relocation of the court to a new city, Akhet-Aten. The king and his officials adopted the new religion, and those who accepted it were rewarded, while the old religion was still practiced by officials in Syria and Palestine who were not formally informed of the change. The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was consecrated and became the center of the new religion, with the queen-mother Teye showing respect for her son's opinions by visiting the city. The Aten dogma represented a shift towards a more natural and spontaneous form of worship, but its impact on religious thought is still a matter of interpretation.
