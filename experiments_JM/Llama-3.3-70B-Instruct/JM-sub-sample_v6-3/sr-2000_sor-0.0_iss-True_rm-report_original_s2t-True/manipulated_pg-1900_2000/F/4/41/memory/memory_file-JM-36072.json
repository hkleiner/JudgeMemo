The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a self-contained village system, a sparse population, and a genuine aristocracy that held political power. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and kindled a strong sense of patriotism in England, isolating it from European thought. The Victorian Age was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order."

        "section_summary": "During the early 19th century, England's intellectual life continued to thrive despite the war, with notable literary figures like Scott, Wordsworth, and Jane Austen. However, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and poor living conditions prevalent, as described by Byron and others. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises, which were exacerbated by over-population and a low standard of civilization. The introduction of food from America and Australia later helped to alleviate some of these issues. Despite these challenges, the country experienced significant progress during the first half of the reign, with advancements in education, liberty, and economic growth."
