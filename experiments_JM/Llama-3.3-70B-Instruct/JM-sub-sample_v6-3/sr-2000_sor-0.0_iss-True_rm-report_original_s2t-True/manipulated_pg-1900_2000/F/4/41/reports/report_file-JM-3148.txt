Section section_02 (Chars 7935–11543):
Section Summary: Anthony, a curious and inquisitive boy, often slipped out of his classroom to snap a tuning fork, which was hidden under a thistle, to momentarily escape the monotony of his lessons. Despite being considered the laziest boy in the village, Anthony was actually driven by a desire to learn and understand the world around him, constantly asking "why" and "how" about the natural phenomena he observed. He spent much of his free time in the woods, educating himself and gathering knowledge about the natural world, including the locations of rare flowers and the songs of wild birds. Anthony's mother acknowledged that he had a wealth of "useless information" about the natural world, which he had acquired through his own explorations and observations. Through his self-directed learning, Anthony developed a deep connection with nature and a sense of wonder about the world.
