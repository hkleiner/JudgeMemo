Section section_01 (Chars 0–8051):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front lines, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a "carnet rouge" allowing her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, Révigny, and Bar-le-Duc, with the possibility of visiting other areas later. The author visits Meaux with a French friend, where they witness the devastating aftermath of the Battle of the Marne, with fields of graves marked by flags and crosses.

Section section_02 (Chars 8051–11523):
Section Summary: The village of Barcy was heavily damaged during the war, with its church and several houses reduced to ruins. The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, listening to constant shellfire overhead. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter of introduction to facilitate their trip. They traveled to these destinations alone, observing many healthy and contented soldiers at the train station and on the trains. The narrator was impressed by the height and demeanor of the French officers they met during their journey, who seemed confident and capable of leading their country.
