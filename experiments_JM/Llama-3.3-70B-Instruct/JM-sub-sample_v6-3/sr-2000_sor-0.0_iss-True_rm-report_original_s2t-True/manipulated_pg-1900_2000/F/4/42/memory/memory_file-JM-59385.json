Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits this street with her grandmother, mother, and a relative to purchase her dowry jewels. At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered tea, and then begin the process of selecting and bargaining for the finest pearls.
