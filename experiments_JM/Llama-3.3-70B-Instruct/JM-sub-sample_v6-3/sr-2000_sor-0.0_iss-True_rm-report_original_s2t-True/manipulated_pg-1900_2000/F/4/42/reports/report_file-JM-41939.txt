Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a drawing master and her mother Sophie Marquis a music teacher. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After trying various occupations, including dressmaking and school, Rosa's father allowed her to focus on art, and she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which showed promise of her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to art, spending hours copying the works of great masters at the Louvre and embarking on a path to become a renowned artist.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, also known as "the little hussard," spent her early years studying art at the Louvre and in her father's studio, where she developed a strong foundation in line-work and anatomy. She lived in various locations in Paris, including the Rue Rumford, where she was surrounded by farms and animals, which sparked her passion for painting animals. Rosa's dedication to her craft led her to study animal anatomy, sculpture, and dissection, and she even kept a menagerie in her home to observe and draw her subjects. In 1841, at the age of 19, she submitted her first paintings to the Salon, which were accepted, and she continued to exhibit her work annually, eventually gaining recognition from critics for her sincere and vigorous talent. Through her hard work and perseverance, Rosa established herself as a skilled painter of animals, known for her attention to detail and ability to capture their physiognomies and actions with fidelity and art.
