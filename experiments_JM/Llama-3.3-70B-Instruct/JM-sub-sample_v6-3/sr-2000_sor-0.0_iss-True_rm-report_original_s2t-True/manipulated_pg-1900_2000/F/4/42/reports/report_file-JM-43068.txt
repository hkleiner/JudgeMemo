Section section_01 (Chars 0–8846):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is considered one of the greatest painters of peasant life, alongside masters like Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, which can be attributed to his gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters like Andrea Mantegna. His paintings, such as "The Angelus," capture the struggles and simple faith of rural life, and are not sentimental but rather infused with intense earnestness and melancholy truth. Millet's unique style, which is subdued and restrained, is deeply rooted in his connection to the natural world and the people he depicted. As a painter, Millet's strength lies not in technical brilliance, but in his ability to convey a profound message and emotional depth in his work.

Section section_02 (Chars 8847–12750):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and simplicity of rural life, often focusing on the loneliness and hardships of the peasant's labor. His work reveals a philosophical mind that grappled with the problems of life, and his poverty and connection to the natural world likely influenced his artistic perspective. Overall, Millet's art is marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep understanding of the human experience.
