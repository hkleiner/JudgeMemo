Her father, a drunkard, is forced to leave the town and join a group of men headed to Boston, leaving Debby behind. Despite her desire to go with him, Debby is bound out to Mrs. Lane, a strict and proper woman, who tries to teach her discipline and useful skills. Debby is miserable in her new home, longing for her father and her old life, and finds comfort in secretly playing her drum, a childhood treasure. As she navigates her new life, Debby remembers her mother's words and promises, and struggles to come to terms with her difficult past."

Debby is defiant and refuses to obey Mrs. Lane's orders, including a ban on speaking to her friend Jack Martin. As a punishment, Debby is sent to her room, where she reflects on her life and thinks about her mother and father, who is away and possibly fighting in a battle against the King's men. Debby's thoughts are filled with resentment towards Mrs. Lane and the King, and she longs to be free and independent. As the evening approaches, Debby awaits Mrs. Lane's return, knowing she will face further punishment if she doesn't show repentance."
