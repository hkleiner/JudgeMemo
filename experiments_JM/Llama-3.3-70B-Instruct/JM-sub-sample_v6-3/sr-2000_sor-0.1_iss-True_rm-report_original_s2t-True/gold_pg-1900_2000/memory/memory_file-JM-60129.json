        "section_summary": "The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, and left the Chinese town of Chint'a, heading southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team crossed a barren landscape and eventually arrived at the village of Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people, also known as the \"yellow Yögurs\". The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape disease or other factors. The team was hosted by the local lamas, who lived in small wooden houses and earned a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the village's administration and tax payments to the Chinese government. The Sarö Yögur people had a distinct language and culture, but lacked a written language and were reluctant to share their history, legends, or songs with the expedition team."

        "section_summary": "The Sarö Yögur people's homes were traditionally furnished with Chinese-style sleeping stoves, Buddhist altars, and brick fireplaces for preparing tea. Their household utensils and clothing were also largely of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences. The women's traditional head dresses were particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Yögur people engaged in basic handicrafts such as weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men making baskets and knitting stockings. Their woven cloth was one of their few saleable items, which they would sell in nearby markets."
