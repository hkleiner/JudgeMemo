Section section_01 (Chars 0–8188):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers, also known as Huang Fantzu or "yellow barbarians," have a legend that their forefathers came from a city in the west over a thousand years ago. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique language and culture, but their history and traditions are not well-documented, and they were hesitant to share their stories with the expedition team.

Section section_02 (Chars 8188–12747):
Section Summary: The houses visited were generally clean and built in Chinese style, with traditional features such as a sleeping stove and Buddhist altar. The people's clothing and household items were also largely Chinese in origin, with some Mongolian influences. The women's head dresses were particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, copper rings, and metal ornaments. The Sarö Yögur people had limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items as they only sold old, worn-out items. The women were skilled weavers, producing cloth of good quality, which was one of the few saleable items they possessed.
