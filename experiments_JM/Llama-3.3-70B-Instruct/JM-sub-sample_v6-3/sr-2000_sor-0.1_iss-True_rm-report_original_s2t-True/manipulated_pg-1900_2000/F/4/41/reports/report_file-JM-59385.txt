At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a reputable dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered a selection of precious stones, including pearls, which Madame Yen and Kuei Ping prefer.

Section section_02 (Chars 8381–11996):
Section Summary: Kuei Ping cherished a memory of her time in school, particularly a conversation with her American teacher, Miss Porter, who inspired her with ideas of freedom and equality. However, Kuei Ping's family had already planned her marriage, and she felt bound by her family ties and unable to pursue her own desires. She had made the difficult decision not to follow her dreams, and this conflict had caused her inner turmoil. As she sat with her grandmother, Madame Yen, and others, discussing her engagement, Kuei Ping's mind wandered back to her conversation with Miss Porter and the ideals that had stirred her heart. The meeting ultimately ended with the engagement arrangements being finalized, and the group prepared to leave.
