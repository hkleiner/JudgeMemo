Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when Englander gets back on his feet. The planetarization of the Transfer Service has left many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, stranded and without a means of income on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–13232):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Englander is grateful and promises to use the money wisely, while Ramsey heads out to a gambling hall, feeling good about his kind deed. However, his luck is bad, and he loses most of his money, leaving him with only three credits. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, dressed in flashy jewelry, arrives at the hall and starts insulting Ramsey, blaming outworlders like him for bringing poverty and trouble to Irwadi. The situation becomes tense, with the Irwadian ordering Ramsey to leave the hall.
