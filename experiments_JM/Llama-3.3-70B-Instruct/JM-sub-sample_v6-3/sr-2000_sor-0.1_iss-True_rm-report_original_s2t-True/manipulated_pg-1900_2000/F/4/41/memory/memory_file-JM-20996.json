This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to bring benefits to the conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's natural beauty and cultural attractions, such as the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. As they crossed the International Date Line, the crew and passengers celebrated with the traditional \"Revels of Neptune\". Upon arriving in Manila, the group was introduced to the local culture and customs, including the unique clothing and habits of the native people."

The city of Manila was built by the Spaniards and has a rich history, with an old walled city and a new city that has sprung up around it. The narrator observed the bustling city life on the old stone bridge, where they saw a diverse mix of people, including foreigners and Filipinos of different classes and backgrounds. The city was filled with activity, including pedestrians, vehicles, and boats in the river, showcasing its cosmopolitan nature. After spending two weeks in Manila, the narrator and others received a notice instructing them to prepare for assignment to their stations, which caused consternation among them."
