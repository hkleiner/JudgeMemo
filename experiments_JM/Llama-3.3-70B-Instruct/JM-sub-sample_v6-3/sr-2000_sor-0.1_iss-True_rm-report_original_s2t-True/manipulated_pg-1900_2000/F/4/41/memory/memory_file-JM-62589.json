Mrs. Lane tries to discipline Debby and teach her to seek forgiveness for her sins, but Debby is rebellious and uninterested. When Mrs. Lane discovers that Debby has been seeing a boy named Jack Martin, she forbids Debby from speaking to him and physically punishes her. Debby is sent to her room to reflect on her behavior, where she thinks about her mother and her absent father, wondering if he may have been involved in the battles at Lexington or Bunker Hill. As the evening approaches, Debby awaits Mrs. Lane's return, knowing she will face further punishment if she doesn't show repentance."
