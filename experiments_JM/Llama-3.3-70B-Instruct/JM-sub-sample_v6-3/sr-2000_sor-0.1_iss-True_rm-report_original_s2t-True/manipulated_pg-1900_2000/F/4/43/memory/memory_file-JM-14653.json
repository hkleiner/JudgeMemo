        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this decline in enthusiasm is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how people perceive the holiday. Children, who still wholeheartedly embrace the spirit of Christmas, are a reminder of how adults once felt about the holiday, and their enthusiasm is a testament to the fact that Christmas was once a more deeply meaningful and passionate celebration. The author argues that acknowledging this decline is necessary to understand and address the issue, rather than simply denying or ignoring it."

        "section_summary": "The traditional Christmas spirit has been lost among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. Their discoveries led to an age of doubt and skepticism, causing people to question long-held beliefs and ultimately losing faith in principles and ideals. However, the core principles of Christmas, such as goodwill and charity, remain intact and are essential to humanity. Despite the decline of traditional beliefs, people still instinctively try to keep the Christmas spirit alive, suggesting that it holds a deeper significance. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit has not been lost, but rather, it has been reevaluated in the face of new knowledge and understanding."
