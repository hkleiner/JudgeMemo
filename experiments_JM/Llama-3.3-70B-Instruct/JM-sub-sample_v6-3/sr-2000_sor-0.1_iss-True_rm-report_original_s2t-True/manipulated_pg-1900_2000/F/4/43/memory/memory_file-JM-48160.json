To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the devastating effects of war, including mass graves and cemeteries."

The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, enduring constant shelling. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Ch√¢lons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter asking the military authorities to show them every civility. As they traveled to these destinations, they observed many soldiers at train stations, all appearing healthy and contented, and were struck by the height and confidence of the French officers. The narrator was eager to experience the reality of war, having been in Paris for three months with little evidence of the conflict beyond the presence of wounded soldiers."
