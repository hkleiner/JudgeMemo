        "section_summary": "The introduction to Will Bradley's chap book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts, bringing a fresh and modern style to a field that was previously stagnant. Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style that was bold, free, and exuberant. The chapter \"The Boy Printer of Ishpeming\" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, growing up in Massachusetts and later moving to Northern Michigan with his mother. Bradley's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was driven by a desire to become an artist and was fascinated by printing and design from a young age. Through his determination and talent, Bradley went on to become a pioneering figure in American graphic arts, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire new generations of artists and designers."

        "section_summary": "The narrator, a young boy, is sent home from school for not having the correct answer to an arithmetic problem and instead asks his mother if he can go to work to earn money to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. He starts working at the Iron Agitator newspaper office, washing and feeding the press, and eventually learns the trade from an itinerant job printer. As he gains experience, his wages increase, and he becomes responsible for setting jobs, advertising, and presswork. The narrator faces challenges, including a poorly heated workspace and frequent power failures, but he perseveres and eventually becomes a skilled job printer, earning a man's wages by the time he is 15. He works under the guidance of George A. Newett, the owner and editor of the Iron Agitator, and later Iron Ore, newspaper."
