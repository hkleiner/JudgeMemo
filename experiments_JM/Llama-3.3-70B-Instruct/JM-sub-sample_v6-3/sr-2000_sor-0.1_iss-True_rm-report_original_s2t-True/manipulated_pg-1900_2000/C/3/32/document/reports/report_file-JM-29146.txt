Section section_01 (Chars 0–8003):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government's decision is seen as a power play to control the flow of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ship construction, and to charge higher prices for it. Ramsey, now stranded on Irwadi, is left to find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene. He has some savings to tide him over, but his future as a pilot is uncertain.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16069):
Section Summary: Chind Ramar, the Irwadi Security Officer, has ordered the crew and passengers of the Polaris to assemble, announcing that the planet has been "planetarized" and all outworld ships are stranded indefinitely. This means that only Irwadian pilots will be allowed to transport titanium, a vital metal, through hyper-space, giving Irwadi control over the market. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is among those affected and has surrendered his pilot license, but he's not too concerned as he has some savings to tide him over. An Earthgirl, who has the ability to read minds, has also left the ship and is heading to the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, trying not to panic. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially and worried about supporting his family, and they discuss their uncertain futures on the planet.

After leaving Englander's place, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is left with only three credits.
