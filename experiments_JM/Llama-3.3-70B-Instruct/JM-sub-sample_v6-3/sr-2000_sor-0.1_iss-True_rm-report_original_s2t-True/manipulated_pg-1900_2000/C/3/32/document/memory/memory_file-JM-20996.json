This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping in Honolulu, where they experienced the city's natural beauty and unique cultural practices. Along the way, they crossed the International Date Line, resulting in the loss of a day, and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs. The author describes the challenging landing in Manila Bay and the group's initial impressions of the city and its people."

The city of Manila was built by the Spaniards and has a rich history, with an old walled city and a new city that has sprung up around it. The narrator observes the bustling activity on the old stone bridge, where people from all over the world, including Americans, Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos, are going about their daily business. The scene is one of great diversity and energy, with pedestrians, vehicles, and boats all moving together in a lively and chaotic mix. After spending two weeks in Manila, the narrator and their fellow teachers receive a notice instructing them to prepare for assignment to their stations, which causes them consternation."
