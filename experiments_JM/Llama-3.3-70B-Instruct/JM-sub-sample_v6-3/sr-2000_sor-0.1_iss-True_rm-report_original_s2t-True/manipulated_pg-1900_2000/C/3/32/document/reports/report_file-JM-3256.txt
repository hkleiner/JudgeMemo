Section section_01 (Chars 0–8137):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare and Milton demonstrates a natural instinct for good literature, despite his lack of formal education. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting, popular books and timeless, classic literature.

Section section_02 (Chars 8137–11560):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and classic. A true classic is one that has enriched the human mind, spoken to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcended the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author believes that a critic's role is to distinguish between books that are merely entertaining and those that have lasting value. Ultimately, a book's subject matter is less important than its literary quality, and a true book lover will appreciate great works regardless of their personal beliefs or preferences.
