They take a tram to Battersea and, upon arrival, try to find the home without asking for directions, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful. A street boy they consider asking for help instead plays a trick on them, and they are left to continue their search. They then spot an official from the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart."
