        "section_summary": "The author recounts how they became a teacher by chance, without a clear aspiration or preparation, and how this was a common experience among their peers. The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession: one who was uninterested and unprepared, and another who was enthusiastic and dedicated to making a positive impact. The second young man's attention to detail and commitment to creating a comfortable learning environment ultimately led to his success and advancement in the field. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, and notes that a pleasing and forceful personality is a key factor in inspiring and educating students. By sharing these experiences, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession."

To be successful, a teacher needs a good general education and should specialize in their chosen field, while also continually broadening their knowledge. When applying for positions, teachers should be careful and thorough in filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A teacher's motivation for applying for a position should be understood by their current superintendent, who can then provide support and assistance. Ultimately, a teacher's goal should be professional growth and improvement, rather than just seeking a higher-paying job."
