Section section_01 (Chars 0–8406):
Section Summary: The story begins by describing the aristocracy of 1785, who were highly cultivated and enlightened patrons of literature and art. The narrator then shifts to the present, where he and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, as they have decided to buy a dog for five shillings. They get off the tram and try to find the home, but instead of asking for directions, they decide to follow a man who appears to be an official of the home, wearing a uniform with the organization's name on his hat. They attempt to track him surreptitiously, but it proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they follow the man, they find themselves in awkward situations, trying to avoid collisions and conversations with him.
