        "section_summary": "The author participated in a historic movement, sending 499 trained men and women from the United States to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands. This event marked an epoch in history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to bring benefits to the conquered. The group traveled from San Francisco, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's beauty and culture, including visiting the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. As they crossed the International Date Line, they lost a day and celebrated with the traditional \"Revels of Neptune\". The group eventually arrived in Manila, where they navigated the rough waters of Manila Bay and were introduced to the local natives."
