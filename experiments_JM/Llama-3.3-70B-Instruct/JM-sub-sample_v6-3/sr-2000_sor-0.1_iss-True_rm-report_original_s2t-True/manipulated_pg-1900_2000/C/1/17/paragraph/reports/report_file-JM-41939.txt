Section Summary: Raymond Bonheur, a talented but impoverished painter, married Sophie Marquis and they had several children, including Rosalie, known as Rosa Bonheur. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After her mother's death in 1833, Rosa's father encouraged her to pursue art, and she began sketching in his studio, producing her first painting, a still life of cherries. With her father's mild encouragement, Rosa became determined to become an artist, and she started copying the works of great masters at the Louvre. This marked the beginning of her artistic journey, driven by her energy, ambition, and courage.
