The scene is set on the Street of Precious Pearls, a narrow side street in a Chinese town where women buy their dowry jewels. Yen Kuei Ping, a young girl, accompanies her grandmother and mother to a jewelry shop on this street to select pearls for her dowry. The family engages in a traditional bargaining process with the shop owner, Wong Lui, to select the finest pearls. As Kuei Ping handles the pearls, she is drawn to their beauty and feels a sense of connection to them, and the scene shifts to a memory of her graduation day at a mission school."

        "section_summary": "Kuei Ping, a Chinese girl, had been inspired by her American teacher, Miss Porter, and the idea of freedom and equality in the United States. However, her family had already planned her marriage and she felt bound by her family ties, making it impossible for her to pursue her dreams. Kuei Ping had to decline Miss Porter's offer to help her, and the decision was a difficult one, causing her inner conflict. Meanwhile, in a separate storyline, a young girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was born in Paris to a family with a questionable reputation, unaware of the significant role she would play in the future. Kuei Ping's decision was finalized as she handed over the pearls to her grandmother, symbolizing her acceptance of her arranged marriage."
