        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for literature and is not made by mere possession of books. The author illustrates this point with an anecdote about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but is not a bookman because he keeps his books locked away and values them for their monetary worth rather than their literary value. In contrast, a person who reads and appreciates classic literature, even if they don't have a large collection, can be considered a bookman. The author also touches on the idea that true appreciation for literature is not about external validation or education, but about a genuine love for reading and learning."

        "section_summary": "The subject of the passage appears to have spent time in Paris, where he produced a number of religious pictures that were well-received by critics. A French critic, likely referring to a different subject, describes a book as a classic that has enriched the human mind and will be cherished for generations. The book is compared to a cathedral, a stately merchantman, and other enduring symbols, highlighting its timelessness and wisdom. The French Revolution and subsequent war caused a panic that delayed necessary changes, with many fearing a similar outbreak in England. The passage also briefly mentions a darker scene, where guards would descend into a pit to drag out prisoners for execution."
