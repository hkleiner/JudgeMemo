The author, determined to visit the front, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions, but eventually gets help from a duchess who introduces her to a high-ranking official. After a month of waiting, the author receives a carnet rouge, a permit that allows her to visit certain areas, but is initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which are not her desired destinations. She persuades the officials to consider other locations, including Vitry-Bar-Duc and Verdun, but is warned that the latter may be too dangerous. The author ultimately visits Meaux, where she witnesses the devastating aftermath of the Battle of the Marne, including vast fields of graves marked by flags and crosses."

        "section_summary": "The author visited several hospitals in France, including the Hôpital Central, which was well-organized and clean. The hospital was run by women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who worked tirelessly to care for the wounded soldiers. The author was impressed by the efforts to make the hospital wards more cheerful, with decorations and amenities to boost the morale of the patients. Despite the wealth and generosity of the French people, many are struggling financially due to the war, and the author appeals to Americans to contribute to the relief efforts. The French people are grateful for the support of Americans, and the author hopes that those who can afford to give will respond to the needs of the soldiers and the people of France."
