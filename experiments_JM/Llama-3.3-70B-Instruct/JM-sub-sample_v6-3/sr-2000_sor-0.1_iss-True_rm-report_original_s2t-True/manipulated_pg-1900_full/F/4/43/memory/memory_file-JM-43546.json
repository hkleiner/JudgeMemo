The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane and decides to take it home. Donald's father, a doctor, suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising it in the paper and giving notice at the police station, but if no one claims it, Donald can keep it. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, complete with shortbread, scones, and cakes, and discusses plans to visit Donald's uncle, Uncle Alan, for a birthday party.
