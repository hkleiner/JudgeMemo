The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a legend that their forefathers came from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and they still retain their language, although some have become amalgamated with the Chinese. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who are responsible for the local administration and education, and learned about the village's customs and way of life. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique culture and language, which resembles Khirgis and Turkish, but they have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history or legends with the expedition team."

The women's head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, copper rings, and metal ornaments.

The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'ang-lung-ssu, was challenging, with a difficult road and slippery ice, but they eventually arrived at the monastery, which was a collection of buildings with a large, impressive temple. The monastery was situated on the lower slopes of small hills, surrounded by grassy shores and slopes, and was the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs."

The lamas, who numbered only around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading services.

They rode through the valleys of Kluadjek-gol and Mör-gol, following a narrow path with steep grassy slopes, and eventually arrived at the Lansor's or Neiman-gol valley. The valley led them to the Chinese town of Li-yen, which they reached after a scenic ride along the river. The town, surrounded by hills and willow trees, was unchanged since Potanin's expedition 20 years prior, and the narrator received a warm welcome from the friendly old mandarin. The mandarin showed his hospitality by sending the narrator a delicious dinner and presenting him with five sable skins as a parting gift."
