Section section_03 (Chars 17495–26466):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged and picturesque landscape shaping his perspective. Millet's family encouraged his early interest in drawing, and he spent his spare time reading and sketching the people and objects around him. As he grew older, Millet's passion for art only intensified, and he eventually made the decision to leave his rural home and migrate to Paris to pursue a career in art. This marked a significant turning point in his life, as he transitioned from a life of agricultural labor to one of artistic expression.

Section section_04 (Chars 26467–35277):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father took him to meet a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, who was impressed by the young artist's drawings. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, leading him to study with M. Langlois in Cherbourg. Langlois, who had a classical style, tried to mold Millet in his own method, but the young artist eventually struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a profound influence on his style. Millet eventually placed himself under the tutelage of Delaroche, but found the experience unsatisfying and soon ceased to attend his studio, instead working to develop his own unique style.
