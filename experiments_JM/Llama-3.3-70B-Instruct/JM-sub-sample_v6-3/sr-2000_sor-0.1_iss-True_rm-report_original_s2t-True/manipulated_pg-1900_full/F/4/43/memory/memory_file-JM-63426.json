Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style, characterized by bold and free typography. The author reflects on Bradley's career, noting that he was a pioneer who broke down barriers and paved the way for future generations of designers. Bradley's early life is also described, including his childhood in Lynn, Massachusetts, and his move to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he developed a passion for art and printing. The author concludes by expressing gratitude to Bradley for his contributions to the field of graphic design."

He starts working at the Iron Agitator, a local newspaper, where he learns the printing trade and quickly becomes skilled, earning a steady income and even being offered a position as job printer. After saving enough money, he travels to Chicago to study art, where he meets Frank Bromley, a landscape painter, and attempts to find work as an artist, but initially ends up working at Rand McNally as an apprentice engraver. However, he soon realizes that designers do not engrave their own blocks and returns to his printing job in Michigan. He later returns to Chicago, where he again works at Rand McNally, this time with a better understanding of the industry and new technologies emerging, such as line photo-engraving and halftones."

In 1895, he visited the Boston Public Library and discovered the noble ancestry of Caslon through the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience had a profound impact on him, and he became inspired to create typography that was spontaneous and joyful. He later established the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, and began printing with Caslon type, which was initially met with skepticism by other printers. The author's passion for typography and printing led to the creation of unique and beautiful publications, including a Strathmore deckle-edge sample book, which showcased his skill and artistry."

        "section_summary": "At the age of 62, Will Bradley retired to southern California in 1930. A quarter-century later, his work experienced a renaissance, culminating in the 1954 Portfolio, a significant design accomplishment. The portfolio was introduced at a luncheon in New York, where several notable figures paid tribute to Bradley's work. The book about Bradley's life and work was assembled from separate papers he wrote between 1949 and 1954, with some editing to create a continuous narrative. The project was a cooperative effort, with significant contributions from Peter Beilenson, who helped with design, printing, and editing."
