Davis's work contributed to the revival of Hebrew, which is becoming a living and spoken language again in Palestine after being preserved as a ritual language for centuries. The concept of the \"Chosen People\" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. However, this idea has also been distorted and adopted by other groups, such as the Germans, who have used it to justify their own claims of superiority. The lecture series aims to explore Jewish thought and culture, starting with the concept of the \"Chosen People\" and its implications."

However, these passages are often set in an ethical framework, emphasizing righteousness and justice, and must be understood within their historical conditions. The Bible is a collection of national literature, written over many generations, and contains both higher and lower strands, with some passages reflecting primitive stages of thought that have been surpassed by later spiritual evolution. Judaism has evolved over time, incorporating the fruits of centuries of spiritual growth, and has replaced more primitive practices and concepts with nobler ones. Ultimately, the Bible must be interpreted in the context of human nature and history, rather than being judged by modern standards or allegorized to fit preconceived notions."

The concept of a \"chosen people\" is often misunderstood, as it refers to a people chosen to serve a greater purpose, not for their own superiority. The Old Testament is filled with metaphors and lyrics that express a noble and idealistic vision, such as the suffering servant and the kingdom of priests. The Jewish people's mission is to bring justice, righteousness, and light to the nations, and their election is designed solely for world-service. The Old Testament's universalism is evident in its cosmic poems and passages, which extend God's benevolence to all creation, contradicting the myth of a tribalistic Jewish God."

The biblical account of Abraham and Moses shows a God who is concerned with justice and morality, and who is willing to listen to human criticism and appeal. The Jewish tradition has always emphasized the universal implications of its religion, and has welcomed proselytes and encouraged the spread of its teachings to all nations. This universalism is reflected in the writings of Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides, Spinoza, and modern Reform Judaism, which emphasize the shared humanity and common God of all people. The idea of a narrow, tribal God is not supported by the biblical text or the historical development of Jewish thought and practice."

        "section_summary": "The period of English history from the 16th to the 18th century was marked by a struggle with France for control of India and the New World, with seven wars fought between the two nations. This era saw the establishment of the East India Company, the founding of British colonies in Virginia and New England, and the growth of British naval power. The concept of England as a \"Chosen People\" emerged during this time, with poets like Thomson and Kipling expressing a sense of national destiny and mission. The idea of a national mission is not unique to England, but is a universal tendency that can be seen in other nations, including ancient Israel. Over time, England's mission evolved from a self-centered focus on expansion and trade to a more universal vision of serving a higher purpose, with its poets and writers playing a key role in shaping this narrative."

The modern German state is characterized by its militarism and glorification of war, which is a departure from its past ideals of peace and righteousness. In contrast, Jewish literature and tradition emphasize the importance of truth, morality, and self-criticism, with the Bible often portraying Israel as the villain of its own story. The difference between Judaism and Germanism can be summed up by the word \"Recessional\", with Jewish writers rebuking their nation and seeking truth, while German writers glorify theirs. Overall, Germanism is more analogous to the militarism of other maritime countries, such as England, rather than Judaism."

In contrast, the Bible acknowledges the violent history of Israel's occupation of Palestine, and English literature has a tradition of self-criticism and awareness of the flaws of nationalism. The author argues that Judaism has a unique contribution to make to the world, particularly in its emphasis on universalism and its potential to inspire a new world order. However, this potential has been hindered by the quarrel between Judaism and Christianity, which the author believes is exaggerated and based on misunderstandings. Ultimately, the author calls for Judaism to reassert its voice and values in the world, and to play a role in shaping a new world order that prioritizes peace, justice, and universalism."
