In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and foreign kings. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The two pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna period, Amenophis III and IV, belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had expanded Egypt's borders through conquest, but under these kings, the focus shifted from war to other pursuits, including a religious reform introduced by Amenophis IV."

The king's efforts were met with resistance, leading to open strife and the eventual removal of the court to a new city, Akhet-Aten. The new doctrine was not widely accepted, and many officials and vassals continued to refer to the old gods, with some even correcting the king's new name to reflect the old religion. The Asiatic provinces, which enjoyed self-government under Egyptian supremacy, were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute disputes, and the immigration of Bedaw√¨n tribes, leading to a state of chaos and instability. The king's attempts to maintain control and collect tribute were often unsuccessful, and the region was marked by constant struggles and alliances between various factions and tribes."

The Egyptian government, despite being well-informed, took a middle course of sending small, inadequate forces to quell disturbances, which sometimes failed to check serious hostilities. The letters from Asian kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relationships, with the Egyptian king being asked for gold and hesitant to give away his daughters in marriage due to their perceived divine status. These letters, including those from Kadashman-Bel and King Tushratta of Mitani, provide valuable insights into the politics and alliances of the time, with the Egyptian king seeking to maintain his power and prestige. The correspondence also highlights the tensions and misunderstandings between the Egyptian king and his foreign counterparts, particularly with regards to marriage alliances and gift exchanges."

After Nimmuria's death, Tushratta's relationship with the new Egyptian king, Akhenaten (also known as Napkhuria), deteriorated due to Akhenaten's insolent tone and neglect of traditional diplomatic etiquette. Akhenaten's actions also strained Egypt's relationships with other kingdoms, including Babylonia, which led to retaliatory measures and a decline in diplomatic relations.

The city of Tunip and Rib-Addi of Gebal sent complaints to Pharaoh about Aziru's aggressive actions, but he managed to evade punishment by conspiring with Egyptian officials and inventing news of Hittite invasions. Eventually, Aziru was summoned to the Egyptian court and arrested, but his appearance had brought a measure of stability to the region, ending a period of lawlessness and petty raids by other chiefs. Despite his troublesome nature, Aziru's actions were seen as beneficial by some Syrian and Phoenician princes, who preferred his rule to the previous state of chaos."

The kingdom of Mitani, which was a major power in Western Asia, was on the verge of collapse and was eventually overtaken by the Hittites and Assyria. The Mitani kingdom was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms, and its eastern boundary was seized by Assyria, marking the beginning of Assyria's rise to power. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also met a swift end, with Napkhuria's city at Tell el Amarna being razed to the ground after his death in 1370 B.C."
