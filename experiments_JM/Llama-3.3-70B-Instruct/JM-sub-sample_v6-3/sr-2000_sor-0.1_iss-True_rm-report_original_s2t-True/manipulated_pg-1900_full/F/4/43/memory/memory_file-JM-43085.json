        "section_summary": "Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying the effects of cavalry on a field of grain. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier's early life was marked by a humble beginning, with his father being a dealer in colonial products and his mother being a fragile woman with a talent for painting on porcelain. Meissonier's own artistic journey began when he discovered his mother's old paint-box, and despite not being a good student, he showed a natural talent for drawing. His father, however, was initially hesitant to encourage his artistic pursuits, given the tumultuous state of the art world at the time, and instead attempted to steer him towards a more practical career as a druggist's apprentice. Meissonier's dedication to realism and his commitment to capturing the truth of nature would become the hallmark of his artistic career."

Despite facing financial struggles, Meissonier persevered and eventually gained recognition for his work, exhibiting for the first time at the age of 16. He began to gain success as an illustrator, particularly with his work on \"The Indian Cabin\", which showcased his attention to detail and realistic style. This success led to more opportunities, and Meissonier was able to establish himself as a talented artist, no longer needing to solicit work. His early success paved the way for his future career, marked by meticulous and detailed artwork that would become his signature style."

His paintings, often small in scale, were initially met with rejection, but he eventually gained recognition, with his work \"Monk Consoling a Dying Man\" being purchased by the Duke of Orleans. Meissonier's small-scale paintings were a hallmark of his style, with some critics arguing that their size was a key factor in their intensity and detail. Despite initial concerns that his paintings were too small, they were ultimately praised for their vividness and ability to draw the viewer in. Meissonier's unique approach to scale and composition allowed him to create intricate and expressive works that continue to be admired."

Fortunately, he was discouraged from continuing down this path by Jules Chenavard and instead focused on his genre painting, such as \"The Reader\", which received praise from critics. Meissonier's success grew rapidly, with each subsequent painting earning him increasing distinction and acclaim, including a second-class medal and a significant purchase by collector Paul Périer. His paintings were notable for their attention to detail, realism, and ability to capture the individuality of his subjects, as described by critic Théophile Gautier. Meissonier's unique style and talent earned him recognition as a master artist, with his paintings offering a window into the lives and characters of his subjects."

Meissonier's paintings also include military scenes, such as \"Napoleon III at Solférino\", which he created after attaching himself to the Imperial Staff of the French army in 1859. He was known for his attention to detail and his desire for accuracy, often going to great lengths to get his subjects to pose for him.

Despite criticism of his lack of color and grace, Meissonier's work was notable for its realism and exactitude, which he achieved through meticulous observation and documentation. He was particularly fond of painting horses, which he saw as a subject of great beauty and complexity. Meissonier's dedication to his craft and commitment to honesty and accuracy earned him great respect and admiration, culminating in his election as president of the Exposition Universelle des Beaux-Arts in 1889."

He had a vast collection of relics and clothing from the Imperial Epoch, which he used to inform his paintings. Meissonier's attention to detail was so intense that he even researched the way linen was cut in the 18th century to achieve more realistic folds in his subjects' clothing. Despite his thorough preparation, he was often dissatisfied with his finished paintings, and was known to have destroyed works that others considered perfect. This level of dedication and self-criticism defines Meissonier's talent and glory as an artist."
