Corvick has to leave suddenly for Paris to assist a woman named Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill, and entrusts the narrator with the task. The narrator writes the review, but later worries that it may not have done justice to Vereker's work, especially after Corvick implies that he wants a more profound understanding of the author. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but doesn't get a chance to discuss the review with him directly. Lady Jane, the host, eventually brings up the review and praises it, which the narrator hopes will lead to Vereker reading and appreciating it."

Vereker revealed that he had long been frustrated by critics' inability to understand his writing, and that the narrator's review, despite its cleverness, was no exception. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kind and humble words, and felt a sense of relief and newfound respect for the author. Vereker's apology and explanation marked a turning point in their interaction, as he began to open up to the narrator about his writing and his feelings about criticism."

However, the man claims he has no knowledge of the secret, and the narrator is shocked to discover that Mrs. Deane never shared it with him. The narrator realizes that Mrs. Deane must not have thought her husband worthy of trusting with the secret, which is a surprising revelation given that she married him. The narrator shares his own story of searching for the secret with the man, who becomes increasingly curious and desirous of knowing the truth. The two men are now united in their unfulfilled desire to uncover Vereker's secret."
