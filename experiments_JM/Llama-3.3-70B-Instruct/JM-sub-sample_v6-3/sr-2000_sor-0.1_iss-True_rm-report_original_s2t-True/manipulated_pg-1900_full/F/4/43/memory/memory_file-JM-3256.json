        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of formal education, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen due to their wealth or social status, but they lack the genuine love and understanding of literature that defines a true bookman. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless, meaningful works of literature."

In contrast, popular but fleeting works, like \"Twice Murdered and Once Hung\", may entertain the masses but lack lasting value. The bookman's own literary tastes are eclectic, ranging from essays by Lamb and Hazlitt to the works of De Quincey and Milton, and he delights in discovering new authors and revisiting old favorites. Ultimately, he seeks literature that is a source of joy, inspiration, and connection to the human experience."

As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works have remained a staple in their library of fiction. The author notes that these classic authors have a timeless appeal, offering a welcome respite from modern novels with a purpose, and that their works continue to be a source of pleasure and inspiration. In particular, the author highlights the mastery of Balzac and the enduring charm of Thackeray's \"Henry Esmond\" and Scott's \"Heart of Midlothian\", which they revisit annually. These classic works have a lasting impact on the author, evoking powerful memories and emotions that remain vivid to this day."

The author then shifts to discussing the joys of being a bookman, rearranging books on shelves, and spending time in a library surrounded by favorite authors and titles. The author imagines a holiday where they can spend a week in their library, free from distractions, and surrounded by books and a beautiful garden. The author also fantasizes about hosting a meeting of fellow book lovers, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Mary Queen of Scots, to share their passion for books."

The author notes that a bookman's wife often suffers as a result of his obsession and may try to intervene, but the bookman's desire for new acquisitions can be too strong to resist. The author humorously describes the bookman's struggles to resist temptation, including making a pledge to abstain from buying rare books, but ultimately succumbing to his desires. The section is a lighthearted and relatable portrayal of the joys and pitfalls of being a book lover."
