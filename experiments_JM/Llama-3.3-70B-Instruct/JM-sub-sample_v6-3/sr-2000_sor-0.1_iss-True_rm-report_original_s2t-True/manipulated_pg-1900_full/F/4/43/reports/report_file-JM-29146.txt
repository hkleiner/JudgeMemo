Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is stranded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot's license. With no ship to pilot, Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the vital metal titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–16009):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Later, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi, where he encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Security Police. Symm insults Ramsey and orders him to leave, and when Ramsey refuses, Symm throws a drink in his face. The situation is tense, with many outworlders present, but Ramsey chooses not to react violently. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations of the Irwadian government, which is trying to reduce outworld influence.

Ramsey intervenes when Symm mistreats a Vegan girl, and they escape together, with Symm vowing to get revenge. Ramsey takes the girl to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, and she teases him about his situation with the Vegan girl.

After a night at Margot's apartment, she disappears, leaving Ramsey and the Vegan girl locked in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter from someone who claims to have discovered the origin of humanoid life in the galaxy, specifically the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth. The letter hints at a significant discovery related to the simultaneous appearance of humanoid types on thousands of stellar worlds millions of years ago.

Margot decides to venture out onto the world, taking Vardin with her, and uses the threat of an m.g. gun to ensure Ramsey's compliance. However, Ramsey points out that the gun is useless in the timeless continuum of hyper-space, where time-based processes like radioactive breakdown cannot occur.
