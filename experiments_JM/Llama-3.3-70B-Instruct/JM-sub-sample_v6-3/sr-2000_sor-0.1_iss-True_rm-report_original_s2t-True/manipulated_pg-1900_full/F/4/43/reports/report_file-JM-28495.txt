Section section_01 (Chars 0–8256):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the dog home, but their attempts at getting directions are thwarted, including a humorous encounter with a mischievous street boy. The couple then spots a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decides to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to the dog home. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and comical.

Section section_02 (Chars 8257–16452):
Section Summary: Stella and the narrator attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but their pursuit ended in failure when the man escaped into his home. After their unsuccessful adventure, they decided to advertise for a dog instead. However, their plans changed when they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick by a string near a pond on the golf course. The narrator cut the string, and they took the puppy home, eventually naming it Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grew up, he became a unique and loyal companion, often accompanying the family on walks and exhibiting a respectful pertinacity despite his humble and awkward appearance.

Section section_03 (Chars 16453–24740):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but awkward companion. Despite being told to go home, Excalibur follows the narrator on a walk and eventually meets up with them at a crossroads. Excalibur is a gentle giant, fond of children and babies, and is often the subject of playful games and activities. However, his memory is poor, as evidenced by an incident where he forgets where he buried a bone, leading to a frantic search and eventual lockdown in the washhouse. Excalibur's antics often cause chaos, including a notable incident where he hides a bone in a cushion behind a guest, Lady Wickham, during a dinner party.

Section section_04 (Chars 24741–32990):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various shopkeepers and animals. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, who was having breakfast. Eileen followed and introduced herself, and the curate was immediately smitten with her. As Eileen and the curate spent more time together, Excalibur found himself acting as a chaperon, and his usual routine was disrupted, including his favorite spot on the tennis lawn, which was now being used for tennis matches between Eileen and the curate. Excalibur was good-natured about the changes, but his slow mind and forgiving nature made him a patient, if sometimes bewildered, observer of the new developments.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a pet, often got in the way of Eileen and the curate's games, including tennis and golf, and they had to work around him.

On a country walk, Excalibur encountered a hare and later found Eileen and the curate sitting together, holding hands and discussing their future. The curate revealed that he had limited financial means and felt they couldn't marry and live on his small income, deciding that he would have to leave for London to find work. Eileen and the curate agreed to keep their plans private, putting on a cheerful facade despite their concerns about their future.

Excalibur was taken to London by Eileen, where he was reunited with the curate, and then accompanied the curate on a train to the north.

Lord Caversham later tracks down the curate and offers to reward him for his heroism, but instead, the curate asks for a better-paying job so he can marry his fiancée. Lord Caversham is moved by the curate's request and considers helping him. The story then shifts to the curate's future, where he is seen living a peaceful life with his family, while a tramp arrives at the rectory gate, marking a new development in the story.

Section section_08 (Chars 57840–59854):
Section Summary: A burly and unpleasant tramp visited the home of a lady, Eileen, looking for the rector. The tramp asked Eileen for money, claiming he hadn't eaten or drunk anything since the previous day, and refused to leave until she gave him some. Eileen left the tramp with Mary Ellen and went into the house, returning with a large dog, Excalibur, which she used to threaten the tramp. The tramp quickly fled the scene after Eileen warned him that she couldn't hold the dog back much longer. Once the tramp was gone, Eileen released her grip on the dog's collar, and Excalibur calmly went to sleep.
