Section section_04 (Chars 26342–34995):
Section Summary: After receiving a knighthood in 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds' social status and reputation continued to grow, and he became more selective with his portrait commissions. He remained a prominent figure in the art world, and his Discourses on art continued to be widely read and influential. In the 1780s, Reynolds traveled to the Low Countries, where he studied the works of Dutch masters, and he continued to paint notable portraits, including those of Mrs. Siddons and the Duchess of Devonshire. However, his productivity began to slow down, and in 1789, he suffered a sudden loss of vision in one eye, which forced him to stop painting. Despite his retirement from painting, Reynolds' legacy as a leading artist and art theorist of his time remained unchanged.

Section section_05 (Chars 34996–43598):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds spent his final years preparing for his death, sustained by memories of the past and surrounded by friends. He delivered his final address to students in 1790 and sat for a portrait by the Swedish artist von Breda, before passing away in 1792 at the age of 69. Reynolds' art is still admired today, and his ability to assimilate and learn from other masters, such as Rembrandt and Titian, contributed to his success. He sought to unite the excellences of various artists, while avoiding their defects, and developed a unique style through years of study and practice. Reynolds' portraits are notable for their beauty and technique, although some critics argue that they often lack a sense of humanity, particularly in his depictions of women and children.

Section section_06 (Chars 43599–47064):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children lack a sense of intimacy, suggesting he had no deep interest in them. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his exceptional skill and ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' vision was comprehensive, and his portraits were masterful in their simplicity and directness, making it difficult for other artists to approach the same subjects. However, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it challenging to appreciate his work at its best. Despite this, Reynolds' name and fame remain a source of pride in British art and a subject of admiration worldwide.
