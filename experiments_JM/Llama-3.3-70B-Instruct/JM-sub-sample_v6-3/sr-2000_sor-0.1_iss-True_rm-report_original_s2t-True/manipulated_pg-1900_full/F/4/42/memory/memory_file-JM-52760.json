Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to ending the war, as it would likely lead to the abandonment of Richmond and deal a significant blow to the Confederacy."

The city's defenses, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates, led by General Beauregard, were initially outnumbered but received reinforcements from General Lee, and the battle continued for several days with intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces ultimately failed to break through the Confederate lines, and the battle became a prolonged siege of the city."

The Confederate defense line held, and the Union army was forced to settle for a siege, with 111,000 Union troops facing 47,000 to 51,000 Confederates. The Union army then attempted to encircle Petersburg, with a failed attempt to capture the Weldon Railroad, but this marked the beginning of a series of attempts to encircle the city. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including coal miners, devised a plan to dig a mine under the Confederate lines and blow it up, which became known as the Battle of the Crater. The mine was successfully dug, and on July 30, 1864, it was detonated, destroying a key Confederate strong point, Pegram's Salient."

Grant's strategy shifted to extending his siege lines and cutting off Lee's supply lines, starting with the capture of the Weldon Railroad in August. The Union army made further gains in late September and October, including the Battle of Peebles' Farm, which extended their lines west of the Weldon Railroad but failed to capture the Southside Railroad.

The Union army, led by General Grant, continued to push west, extending their lines and forcing Lee to lengthen his defenses, with the Battle of Hatcher's Run in February 1865 being a key example. The campaign was marked by boredom, hardship, and disease, with both sides suffering, but the Confederates were particularly plagued by hunger and despair.

He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union fort near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through the Union lines and allow for a retreat. The attack, led by General Gordon, initially succeeded in capturing the fort, but was ultimately repelled by Union forces, resulting in over 4,000 Confederate casualties.
