This event marked a milestone in civilization and an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's beauty and unique culture, including the famous sport of surf-shooting. Along the way, they crossed the International Date Line, resulting in the loss of a day, and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs. The author describes the challenging landing in Manila Bay and the group's initial impressions of the city and its people."

Upon arrival, they found a town of several thousand people with limited infrastructure, and witnessed the departure of troops and the beginning of a new era of peace.

They had to build schools, secure supplies, and overcome difficulties in introducing a new system of education. The teachers eventually made progress, with two schools operating successfully in Talisay, and they were also welcomed by the local community, as evident from the \"baile\" invitation they received from the town of Silay."

In these rural areas, life is marked by a lack of effort and a focus on leisure, with people spending their days lounging and enjoying the natural beauty of their surroundings. The homes of Filipinos also reflect their social class, with the rich having large, well-furnished houses and the poor, known as the \"tao\", living in simple conditions with limited access to food and other necessities.
