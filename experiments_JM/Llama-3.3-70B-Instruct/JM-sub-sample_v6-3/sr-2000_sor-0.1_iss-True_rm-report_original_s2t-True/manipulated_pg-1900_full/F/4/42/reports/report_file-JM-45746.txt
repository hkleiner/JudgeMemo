Section section_08 (Chars 64822–70105):
Section Summary: Helping students choose the right vocation is a significant challenge for homes and schools. To address this, schools are implementing vocational guidance programs, trade schools, and part-time schools to prepare students for their future careers.

Many parents and community members are unaware of the resources and opportunities available in schools, leading to misconceptions about the value of education.
