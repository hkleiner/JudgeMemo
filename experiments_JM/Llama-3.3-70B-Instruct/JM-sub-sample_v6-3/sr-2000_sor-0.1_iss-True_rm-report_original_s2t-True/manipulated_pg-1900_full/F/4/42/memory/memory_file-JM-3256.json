        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than just collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary education, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen due to their wealth or social status, but they lack the genuine love and understanding of literature that defines a true bookman. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless, meaningful works of literature."

He distinguishes between books that are fleeting and those that are classics, which have a timeless quality and wisdom that transcends generations. The bookman's taste in literature is eclectic, ranging from essays by Lamb and Hazlitt to the works of Milton, Gibbon, and De Quincey. He is drawn to books that are well-written, thought-provoking, and offer a unique perspective, regardless of their subject matter or the author's reputation. Ultimately, the bookman's love affair with literature is a lifelong journey, with a deep appreciation for the classics that first sparked his passion for reading, such as \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\"."

As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, and the classics - Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works remain a staple in their library. The author holds a special place for Thackeray's \"Henry Esmond\" and Scott's \"Heart of Midlothian\", two books that they revisit annually, and struggles to choose between the two due to their unique charms. These classic novels offer a sense of comfort and pleasure, allowing the author to escape the intensity of modern literature. The author ultimately concludes that both Thackeray and Scott are masters of their craft, each with their own strengths and memorable characters."

The author also references a passage from Scott's \"The Heart of Midlothian\" where Jeanie Deans pleads with the Queen to spare her sister's life, showcasing the power of eloquent and true-to-life writing. The text then shifts to the bookman's love of rearranging his books, finding joy in the process of organizing and rediscovering favorite passages and authors. The author imagines a gathering of bookmen, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Mary Queen of Scots, to share their passion for books and literature. Ultimately, the section celebrates the delight of immersing oneself in a personal library, surrounded by the spirit of books and the beauty of nature."

A book collector, or \"bookman,\" can become so enamored with books that it becomes an obsession, similar to a disease, and can lead to financial and personal sacrifices. The author humorously compares this obsession to dipsomania, or alcoholism, with the bookman's wife often suffering as a result of his habits. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to make sacrifices and even practice deceit in order to obtain the books he desires."
