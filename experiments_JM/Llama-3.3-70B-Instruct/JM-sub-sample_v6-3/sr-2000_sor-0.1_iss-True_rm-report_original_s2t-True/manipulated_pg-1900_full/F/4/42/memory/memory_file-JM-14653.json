        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has lost its magic and excitement for adults, who now have to force themselves to enjoy the holiday. In contrast, children still experience the wonder and joy of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what keeps the spirit of the holiday alive. The author argues that Christmas was not always a children's holiday, but was once a deeply meaningful and exciting celebration for adults as well. The fact that children now cling to traditional Christmas practices and customs suggests that these things were once deeply valued by adults, but have since been diminished. The author believes that acknowledging the decline of Christmas's magic is a necessary step towards understanding and addressing the issue."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. This has led to a decline in faith and a loss of enthusiasm, spontaneity, and sentimentality, with people now seeking something to believe in. However, the author argues that the principles of faith, goodwill, and morality remain intact, and that the Christmas spirit, which embodies these principles, is still alive. The celebration of Christmas on December 25 was actually influenced by the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which symbolized the triumph of light over darkness and the birth of hope. Despite the changes brought about by science and modernity, the author believes that the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas will endure."

Despite differences, mankind is a fellowship of brothers, and the idea of social justice, which means putting goodwill into practice, is a flourishing faith. The concept of universal goodwill is alive and well, inspiring many people, including literary artists, to work towards a better world. Christmas, with its traditions and spirit of peace and goodwill, is a fitting festival to celebrate this faith, and its customs, such as gift-giving and sending cards, can be powerful symbols of sympathy and goodwill. By embracing these traditions with sincerity and imagination, people can foster a sense of brotherhood and goodwill, even in a world filled with uncertainties and challenges."

While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and embrace the ridiculous. The author also argues that attempting to replace traditional festivals with more modern or intellectual celebrations would be futile and likely ridiculous. Instead, the author suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas festival is to focus on cultivating goodwill among people, which is a fundamental element of the holiday's spirit. By doing so, the festival can regain its genuine significance and become more than just a perfunctory tradition."

Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill towards a specific individual, such as a family member or someone who frequently annoys them. This can be done by imagining oneself in the other person's shoes and sympathizing with their feelings, pains, and pleasures. The author emphasizes the importance of using one's imagination to understand and connect with others, and suggests that this can be achieved by thinking frequently about the person and reflecting on their existence with empathy. By doing so, one can increase their goodwill towards others and contribute to a more harmonious and happy life."

Regular practice of this exercise can result in a new attitude of mind, characterized by increased sympathy and understanding of others. As one cultivates goodwill, the \"superior person\" within oneself, who is prone to egotism and criticism, begins to decline, and one's relationships with others become more meaningful and interesting. This discipline can also lead to a greater sense of connection and companionship with others, making special occasions like Christmas more personal and significant. Ultimately, the systematic cultivation of goodwill can lead to an increase in one's own happiness."

However, the disparity between one's aims and achievements can be significant, leading to feelings of failure and shame. Ultimately, people are driven to keep striving, fueled by a deep-seated optimism and a desire to transcend their current circumstances."
