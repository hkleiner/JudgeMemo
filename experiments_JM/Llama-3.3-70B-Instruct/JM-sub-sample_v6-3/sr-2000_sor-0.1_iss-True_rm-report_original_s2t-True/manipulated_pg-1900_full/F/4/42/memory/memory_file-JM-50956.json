Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and military efforts were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan to defeat France quickly was thwarted by Russia's intervention. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was instrumental in the Allied victory, and its contributions should not be underestimated."

By advancing into East Prussia, Russia diverted German troops from the French front, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory in the First Battle of the Marne. German General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to distort this fact, falsely claiming that he defeated a large Russian force with a small German army, when in reality, he had a significant numerical advantage. Ludendorf's own admission that the transfer of German troops to East Prussia had \"fatal consequences\" for Germany underscores the importance of Russia's actions. Russia's self-sacrifice and efforts during the early years of the war were instrumental in preventing a German victory, and their contributions should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts."

In October and November 1914, Russia's military operations in Galicia, Poland, and East Prussia forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers from the Western front, abandoning their offensive at Ypres and delaying their attack on France for over a year. The Russian Army's efforts compelled the Germans to focus on the Eastern front, restricting their operations in the West to a defensive stance. This strategic shift was a significant turning point in the war, as it prevented the Germans from crushing France and ultimately contributed to their defeat. Russia's sacrifices and military successes played a decisive role in the war, despite being understated by German General Ludendorf in his memoirs."

Despite this, the Russian Army played a crucial role in diverting German forces and resources away from the Western front, allowing the Allies to prepare and accumulate new reserves. The Russian front tied up significant German forces, with 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions deployed against Russia in May 1917, compared to only 142 divisions on the Anglo-French front. This diversion of German resources ultimately contributed to the failure of their offensives in France, including the battle of Verdun. The Russian Army's efforts, although often overlooked, were a significant factor in the ultimate defeat of Germany."

In 1916, Russia launched a crucial offensive, led by General Brusilov, which helped the Italians by forcing the Austrians to abandon their offensive and transfer troops to the Russian front. This offensive also had a significant impact on the French front, allowing the Allies to launch a successful counter-offensive at the Somme and Verdun. Russia continued to provide assistance to its allies, including helping to defend Romania from invasion in late 1916, despite its own military exhaustion and supply shortages. Even in 1917, during the Russian Revolution, Russia's presence on the Eastern front still tied up significant enemy forces, preventing them from being deployed to the French front."
