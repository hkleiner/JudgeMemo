Vardin, a proto-man, reveals that his ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and Ramsey has helped him succeed. With the crisis averted, Ramsey and Margot leave the planet together, and Margot confesses her love for Ramsey. They blast off into space, ready to start a new life together, free from the dangers of the matter-transmission technology."
