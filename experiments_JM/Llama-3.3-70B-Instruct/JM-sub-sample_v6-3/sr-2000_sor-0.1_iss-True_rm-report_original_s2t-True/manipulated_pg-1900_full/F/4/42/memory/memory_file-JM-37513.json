Spencer's philosophy of evolution, which describes the transformation of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations, had a profound impact on the author. The author notes that Spencer's idea of differentiation as the cardinal law of evolution implies a universal cause, and that every active force produces more than one change. Spencer's work, particularly his Synthetic Philosophy, contains the germ of his best teachings and has had a significant influence on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics. The author acknowledges Spencer's contributions to these fields, but also notes that his narrow focus on biological relationships sometimes limited his perspective on other important relationships."

Despite this, he had established a significant position in the philosophy of life and mind. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the universality of law and evolution, and he is known for his concept of the \"Unknowable,\" or the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. He believed that this Unknowable force is the source of all phenomena, but it is beyond human understanding. Spencer's idea of the Unknowable is distinct from the scientific concept of unknown or unexplained phenomena, as it implies a positive and active power that drives the world, rather than simply a lack of knowledge."

Both Spencer and Bergson agree that the source of evolution is unknowable by the intellect, but Bergson criticizes Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution from the fragments of the evolved. Spencer's philosophy posits the existence of an ultimate Power or Source, which he calls the Unknowable, while Bergson's philosophy attributes this power to Life. The section also touches on Spencer's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, but notes that his statements on this topic can be puzzling. Ultimately, both thinkers seek to understand the Source or ultimate reality that underlies the world of change and phenomena."

Clifford, who argued that an exact knowledge of facts can supersede the need to inquire about their causes. In science, relatedness and change are key concepts, and formulas can be used to express the rate of change in certain systems, making the concept of cause unnecessary. The idea of energy as an active agent that produces change is also misleading, and energy is better understood as a constant ratio of variables that describes the changes themselves. The distinction between cause and conditions is also problematic, and philosophers like Mill have argued that the cause is the sum total of all conditions, both positive and negative. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the meaning of these concepts and remove ambiguity in scientific interpretation."

These types of relatedness are hierarchical, with cognitive relatedness implying vital relatedness, and vital relatedness implying physico-chemical relatedness.

Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science has undergone changes, including a recognition of specific vital characters in living organisms that cannot be conceived in physico-chemical terms. Spencer's view on cognitive relation emphasizes that knowledge involves a complex relationship between the organism and the environment, and that cognition is a network of relatedness involving many terms. However, his analysis of cognitive relatedness is considered inadequate, and his terminology can be perplexing. Ultimately, a scientific interpretation of cognitive relatedness must be dealt with on lines strictly analogous to those on which any other relational problem is treated, without relying on non-scientific entities."

Cognitive relatedness is complex and involves multiple terms, and the author notes that it is effective, meaning that it can bring about changes in the system without interfering with physical principles.
