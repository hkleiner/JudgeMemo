Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "it seemed at that time that the artist would enjoyed" should be "enjoy"
* [GRAMMAR] "the concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity" is a bit awkwardly phrased
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the artist's painting to her death and funeral is somewhat abrupt
* [CLARITY] The sentence "And this innumerable cort√®ge that followed her bier testified more eloquently than any panegyric to the goodness of this admirable artist who had been able to lead a long and glorious career without creating a single enemy" is a bit long and confusing
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
