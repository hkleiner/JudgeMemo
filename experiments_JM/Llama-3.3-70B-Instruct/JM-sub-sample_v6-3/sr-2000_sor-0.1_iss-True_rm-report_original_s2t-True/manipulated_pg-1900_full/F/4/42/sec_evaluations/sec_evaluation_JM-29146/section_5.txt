Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "He read it and do not looked up" should be "He read it and did not look up"
- [LEXICON] "man-tailored jumper" is an unusual phrase, potentially distracting
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, affecting readability
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story jumps abruptly from discussing the proto-man letter to Margot's return and the want bulletin
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the scene with the letter and the scene with Margot's return could be smoother
- [CLARITY] Some sections, such as the description of working on the ship, feel a bit disjointed from the rest of the narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
