The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a stable equilibrium, characterized by self-contained villages and a sparse population. The aristocracy held political power and were highly cultivated, but the French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a period of isolation for England, which became more disconnected from European thought. The Victorian Age was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order."

In contrast, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and overpopulation being major issues, as highlighted by writers like Byron and Disraeli. Despite the struggles of the poor, the country as a whole experienced significant progress and growth during the first half of the 19th century, leading to a sense of complacency among the upper classes. However, this complacency was met with a violent protest from social critics like Carlyle and Ruskin, who denounced the social and economic conditions of the time and advocated for a return to simpler, more idealistic ways of living. These critics saw the Industrial Revolution as a blunder that had led to the decay of art, beauty, and morality, and called for a re-evaluation of societal values."

The army, however, was in a state of disarray, with poor discipline, brutal treatment of soldiers, and incompetence in leadership, as revealed during the Crimean War. Despite these challenges, the reign saw unprecedented progress in many areas, including finance, education, and science, leading to a sense of optimism and good governance. Overall, while there were still issues, particularly in foreign politics, the period is often regarded as a time of significant improvement and reform in England."

The settlement after 1815 led to the restoration of despotic governments in Europe, and the democratic movements of 1848 were ultimately unsuccessful. Britain's period of prosperity and security during the Victorian era was due to temporary advantages, such as its geographical location and industrial lead, which are now passing. The era also saw significant intellectual and literary movements, including the Romanticist revolution and the emergence of great Victorian writers like Alfred Tennyson. The Victorian era was marked by an unprecedented output of literature and a galaxy of great poets and thinkers, whose legacy continues to be felt today."

His work, such as the Idylls of the King, was an allegory that explored themes of ideal manhood and the struggle between sense and soul. Tennyson's poetry reflected his age, with its mix of conservatism and liberalism, and he was concerned about the social and political upheavals of his time, foreseeing many of the evils that would come to pass. He represented the Victorian mood in religion, which was characterized by a distinctively Victorian attitude towards faith, with many intellectuals embracing doubt and questioning traditional dogma. Overall, Tennyson's work continues to offer insights into the human condition, and his poetry remains relevant despite the passing of time."

The era's greatness was due to a combination of transient circumstances, and its decline was marked by the disintegration of society and the rise of antagonistic movements. The fusion of social classes and the growth of industry also had both positive and negative effects, including the creation of a new type of worker who was no longer valued for their craftsmanship. The author believes that the Victorian Age, along with the Elizabethan Age, represents a peak in English civilization, and that the country's grand-scale work on the world stage is likely coming to an end. The future of England now depends on the younger generation, who will shape the country's destiny in the years to come."
