Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "made up their minds" should be "made up their minds" but "the little girls to made up" is incorrect, it should be "the little girls made up"
- [SPELLING] "mighted" is not a word, it should be "might"
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the visit to Melrose Abbey and the description of the "Border" land could be smoother
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the story of Grey Friars Bobby to the visit to Abbotsford
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
