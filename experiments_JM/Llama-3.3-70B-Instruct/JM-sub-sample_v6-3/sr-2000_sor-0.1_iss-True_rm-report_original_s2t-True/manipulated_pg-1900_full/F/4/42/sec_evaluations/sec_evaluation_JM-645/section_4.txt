Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] missing article in "I had been indiscreet—my compunction was great.  I _have_ told somebody"
- [LEXICON] word choice "minister to his mirth" may be unclear to some readers
- [SYNTAX] sentence structure in "I told him about Corvick’s cleverness, his admiration, the intensity of his interest in my anecdote; and without making too much of the divergence of our respective estimates mentioned that my friend is already of opinion that he saw much further into a certain affair than most people" is complex and may cause reading difficulty
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] abrupt transition from discussing the narrator's failure to understand Vereker's work to Corvick's interest in the same topic
- [TRANSITION] lack of clear connection between the narrator's visit to Vereker's house and the preceding events
- [CLARITY] some sentences, such as "He was quite as fired as I had been at Bridges", are unclear or worded vaguely
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
