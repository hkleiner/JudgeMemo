After Mason's death, Robert waits for Morley to return, but instead, he's found by two British riders, Norton and Harding, who mistake him for Morley due to their resemblance.

Despite his injuries, Robert tries to make his way back to Washington's army, but instead, he comes across Morley, who is also wounded and dying. Morley asks Robert to deliver a message to his mother in London, and also to find a girl named Deborah Mason in Plymouth and tell her that all will be forgiven. Robert promises to fulfill Morley's requests and, after Morley's death, he sets out to reach Washington's army, guided by the sound of heavy firing in the distance. Weakened by his wound, Robert struggles to stay on his feet, fearing that he may not survive to deliver the messages or report back to Washington."

As Robert recovers, he eventually reveals to Doctor Bell that he is actually a woman who had disguised herself as a man to fight in the war. Doctor Bell is sympathetic and offers to help Debby, writing a letter to explain her situation to General Washington, who has requested to meet with her to thank her for her bravery. Debby, still weak and fearful, meets with Washington and presents the letter, trusting that Doctor Bell has explained her situation in a way that will help her.
