Vereker's death soon follows, and the narrator is left feeling shut out of the secret he had been seeking. The narrator's friend, Drayton Deane, marries the widow of a man who had also been searching for the secret, and the narrator expects Deane to reveal the truth, but he never does. The narrator becomes obsessed with the idea that Deane knows the secret but is not sharing it, and he tries to engage Deane in conversation to no avail. The narrator's frustration and curiosity continue to grow, even after Deane's wife dies, leaving him to wonder if he will ever uncover the truth."

        "section_summary": "The narrator meets Drayton Deane, whose wife had recently passed away, at a small club. The narrator assumes that Deane's wife had shared a valuable secret about author Hugh Vereker with her husband, and he offers to make a deal with Deane to learn the secret. However, Deane claims to have no knowledge of the secret, which surprises the narrator and makes him realize that Deane's wife may not have thought him worthy of trusting with the information. The narrator then shares his own story of searching for Vereker's secret with Deane, who listens with interest and curiosity. Deane's reaction suggests that he is capable of understanding the secret, but his wife's lack of trust in him has left him feeling disturbed and curious."
