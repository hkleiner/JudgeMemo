Section section_01 (Chars 0–8188):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. As they traveled, they encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs, also known as "yellow barbarians" by the Chinese, claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago. The village has a small temple, where seven or eight lamas live and earn a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history, legends, or songs with the expedition.

Section section_04 (Chars 24382–32480):
Section Summary: The author bid farewell to their host and began their journey to the village of Yench'i, accompanied by their men and two packhorses. Along the way, they observed the poor soil and coarse grass, as well as thin and small cows, and noted the lack of energy and manliness among the local Turkish tribe, the Shera Yögurs. The author then traveled to Kanchow, where they obtained a letter of introduction to the Tangutan Prince and prepared for their visit to the "Yellow Tanguts". With a small group of followers, they set out on a winter morning, following a dry river bed and navigating a ravine with icy and stony terrain. As they journeyed deeper into the mountains, they encountered Chinese homesteads, guardhouses, and Buddhist towers, and eventually approached the river Kiito-gol.

Section section_05 (Chars 32481–40609):
Section Summary: The author arrived at K'anglungssu, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, and was struck by the large, massive temple with its gilded Buddha roof-decorations. The monastery's buildings were made of timber, with small, dark rooms and simple furnishings, and the temple itself was decorated with Buddhist pictures and banners. The author noted that the lamas living in the monastery were friendly, but few in number, and that the gegen, or Great Lama, was still a child living in the mountains. The lamas were supported by voluntary contributions and played an important role in the community, but only a small percentage could read the Tangutan language. The author ultimately left the monastery after being unable to persuade the lamas to participate in anthropological measurements, and departed with the t'umu, Rentshen Nurgo, as his guide.

Section section_07 (Chars 48427–55967):
Section Summary: The Yögurs, a Mongolian tribe, believe they share a common ancestry with the Sarö Yögurs, despite linguistic differences. The Chinese government had previously exterminated a tribe called the Hung maotzu, and the Yögurs were later settled in the area, provided with cattle, and considered a kind of irregular troop. The tribe has significantly diminished in size due to death and assimilation with the Chinese, with women outnumbering men and many families having few or no children. The Yögurs have a unique system of "bones" or clans, which determines relationships and marriage eligibility, and they follow traditional customs such as sky burial and arranged marriages. The tribe's administrative division and social practices, including marriage and inheritance customs, are also influenced by their history and cultural traditions.

Their traditional costume consists of a sheepskin coat, scarf, and trousers, with women wearing a distinctive head-dress and ornaments. The Shera Yögurs also have a unique culture, with Chinese influences in their weights, measures, and domestic appliances, but with some traditional practices, such as weaving and joinery, still maintained.

Section Summary: The Yögur people live in uncomfortable tents, but despite their difficult living conditions, they maintain a relatively clean and tidy lifestyle. Their diet consists of traditional nomadic foods such as tea, roasted flour, and meat, which they eat with Chinese chopsticks or their fingers. The Yögurs are a peaceful and content people, with no evidence of quarreling or dissatisfaction, and they spend their evenings singing, praying, and socializing around the fire. Their livestock, including yaks, sheep, and horses, appear to be of good quality, but the Yögurs have not fully recovered from the losses they suffered during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs do not seem to engage in sports or hunting, and their only notable activity is target practice with rifles, which they obtain from Sinin.
