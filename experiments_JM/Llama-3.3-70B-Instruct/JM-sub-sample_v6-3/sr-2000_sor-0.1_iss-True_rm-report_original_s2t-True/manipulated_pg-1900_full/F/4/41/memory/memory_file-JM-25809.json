Meanwhile, Jim, a miner, was working in a tunnel, and his carelessness with the timbering led to a catastrophic collapse. Ches, a young boy, was left alone to rescue Jim, and despite his fear and the danger, he bravely crawled through the rubble to find his injured partner. Ches managed to locate Jim and tended to his wounds, but they were trapped and in need of help. Just as Ches was trying to find a way to signal for help, he heard the sound of the mail rider, Bud, approaching, and he desperately tried to get his attention to rescue Jim."
