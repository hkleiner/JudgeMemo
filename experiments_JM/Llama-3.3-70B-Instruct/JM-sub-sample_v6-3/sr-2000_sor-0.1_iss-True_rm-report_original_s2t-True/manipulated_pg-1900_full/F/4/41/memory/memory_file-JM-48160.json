With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a \"carnet rouge\" allowing her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, which she finds to be a somber and impressive sight, with fields of graves marked by flags and crosses. The author's goal of reaching the front lines, particularly Amiens and Verdun, remains elusive due to the restrictions and dangers of the war zone."

The hospitals were clean, well-organized, and staffed by dedicated women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who worked tirelessly to care for the wounded soldiers. The author noted that the French people, including the wealthy, were struggling to support the war effort due to financial constraints, and were grateful for American generosity and support. The hospitals were well-run, with attention to detail and attempts to relieve the monotony of the wards, and the soldiers appreciated the small comforts, such as appetizing food and drink. The author appeals to readers to support the French war effort, emphasizing the gratitude of the soldiers and the need for continued aid."
