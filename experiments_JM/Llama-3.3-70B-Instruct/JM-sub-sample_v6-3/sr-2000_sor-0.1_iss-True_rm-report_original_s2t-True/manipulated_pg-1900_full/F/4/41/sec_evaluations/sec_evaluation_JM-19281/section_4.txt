Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] typos and spelling mistakes (e.g. "thw", "rathrr", "lroclaiming", "wikl", "inextinguishable" is correct but "unworthy--or even debased" has two dashes instead of one, "inheritor" is correct but "equally available to all the earth's peoples" could be rephrased for better flow)
- [GRAMMAR] minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g. "What all such differing conceptions have in common is the extent to which a phenomenon that is acknowledged to completely transcend human reach has nevertheless gradually been imprisoned within conceptual limits--whether organizational, theological, experiential or ritualistic--of human invention" is a long sentence that could be broken up)
- [LEXICON] some words or phrases may be unclear or overly complex for general readers (e.g. "ever-advancing civilization", "evolution become conscious of itself")
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] some paragraphs or sentences seem disconnected from the main idea or jump abruptly to new concepts (e.g. the transition from discussing the nature of religion to the concept of "evolution become conscious of itself")
- [STRUCTURE] the text could benefit from clearer transitions and a more logical flow of ideas between paragraphs
- [CLARITY] some sentences or phrases are wordy or unclear, making it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning (e.g. "the process is not simply repetitive, but progressive, and is fully appreciated only when perceived in this context")
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
