The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his father, Doctor Gordon, who suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he is overjoyed at the prospect of having a new pet. The story concludes with the family enjoying afternoon tea and discussing plans to visit Donald's uncle, Alan, who has invited them to a birthday party for his daughter Marjorie."

The children also participated in traditional Scottish activities, such as egg-rolling at Easter and Hallowe'en parties with games and treats. During the summer holidays, the Gordons and their friends took a picnic trip to Loch Katrine, where they enjoyed good food and heard stories about the area's history and legends. They learned about famous Scottish figures, including Rob Roy and Robert Burns, and visited Burns' birthplace, a small house in Ayr. The trip was a fun and educational experience for the children, who were proud of their Scottish heritage."

They also learned about Annie Laurie, a real person who lived near Dumfries, and saw her portrait at Maxwelton House. The group then returned to Glasgow, a city with many exciting excursion opportunities, and took a steamer cruise around the nearby islands, passing ship-building yards and historic sites. During their trip, they visited various islands, including the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye, and enjoyed sailing and picnicking together. The children had a wonderful time exploring Scotland and creating lasting memories with their cousins."
