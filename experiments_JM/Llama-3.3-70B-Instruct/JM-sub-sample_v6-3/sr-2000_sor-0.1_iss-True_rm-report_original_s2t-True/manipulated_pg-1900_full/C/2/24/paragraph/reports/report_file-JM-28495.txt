Section section_03 (Chars 16668–24955):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but awkward companion. Despite being told to go home, Excalibur insists on following the narrator, and his persistence is eventually rewarded with attention and affection. Excalibur has a unique personality, being fond of children and babies, and is known for his courtly manners and affectionate nature. He also has a tendency to get into trouble, such as when he was given a shoulder of mutton and then forgot where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's daily walks in the village are also eventful, as he tries to make friends with other dogs, but is often rebuffed, and instead visits a rabbit and receives treats from the butcher and baker.

Section section_04 (Chars 24956–33205):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he was known and loved by the locals. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, who was having breakfast. Eileen followed and introduced herself, and the curate was immediately smitten with her. As they talked, Excalibur caused chaos, eating food and knocking over objects, but the curate was too enchanted with Eileen to mind. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself acting as a chaperon for Eileen and the curate, who spent time together playing tennis and getting to know each other.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a gentle creature, often found himself in awkward situations while accompanying Eileen and the curate on their outings, including games of tennis and golf. During these games, Excalibur would sometimes get in the way, and the players would have to work around him. On a country walk, Excalibur had a frightening encounter with a hare, and upon returning to Eileen and the curate, he found them deeply engrossed in a serious conversation about their future together. The curate had confessed something to Eileen, and they were discussing the challenges of living on a limited income, with the curate ultimately deciding to leave for London to find work and build a better life for them. Eileen and the curate agreed to keep their plans private, and they put on a cheerful facade to hide their true feelings.
