The tablets, known as the Tell el Amarna tablets, were part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of kings Amenophis III and IV, and were written in Babylonian cuneiform. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and included letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The tablets provided valuable insights into the administration and court of the Egyptian kings, including the shift from a warlike spirit to a more peaceful and indulgent era under Amenophis III and IV. The discovery of the tablets has been significant in understanding the history and culture of Ancient Egypt and the Ancient East."

The old priests of Amon in Thebes resisted this change, leading to a conflict between the two groups. Akhenaten's officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and the pharaoh's mother, Teye, also showed respect for his opinions. The Asiatic provinces under Egyptian rule enjoyed self-government, but were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute demands, and immigration of Bedawìn tribes, which led to a complex web of struggles and power struggles. The Egyptian authorities struggled to maintain control and collect tribute, often resorting to force, but ultimately failing to bring lasting peace to the region."

The Pharaoh's government was well-informed about the situation, but its response was inadequate, sending small bodies of men to quell the disturbances, which ultimately led to the defeat of the Egyptian mercenaries, the Shirtani. The letters from Asian kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relations, with the Egyptian king being asked for gold and hesitant to give away his daughters in marriage. The correspondence between Kadashman-Bel and the Egyptian king, Nimmuria, shows a mix of friendship, mockery, and tension, with the Babylonian king pushing for a marriage alliance and the Egyptian king resisting. The kingdom of Mitani, ruled by King Tushratta, was also a significant player in the region, with its dominion extending from Cappadocia to Nineveh, but facing threats from Babylonia and the Hittites."

Tushratta's letters to the Egyptian pharaohs, such as Nimmuria, were filled with requests for gold and declarations of affection, but his later letters became increasingly greedy and insincere. The accession of the reforming king Akhenaten, also known as Napkhuria, brought unrest to Egypt's foreign relations, and he adopted an insolent tone in his responses to Tushratta and other leaders. Akhenaten's actions, including neglecting to send sympathy to the Babylonian king Burnaburiash and sending gold to the Assyrian prince Assurnadinakhi, strained Egypt's relationships with other nations. This marked a significant shift in Egypt's foreign policy, leading to tensions and conflicts with its former allies."

The Hittite king and Tushratta, King of Mitani, also exchanged letters with the Egyptian king, Napkhuria, with Tushratta requesting golden statuettes that had been promised by Napkhuria's father, Nimmuria. Napkhuria sent wooden models instead, leading to a dispute between the two kings. The correspondence ultimately ended with Napkhuria threatening to close his land to Mitani's subjects, and it is likely that all intercourse between the two kingdoms ceased."

Despite his questionable loyalty and conspiring with the Hittite foes of the Egyptian Court, Aziru managed to evade punishment for many years, but was eventually summoned to Egypt and arrested. The political activity of Aziru was seen as a stabilizing force by some Syrian and Phoenician princes, who preferred his rule to the chaos and raiding that existed before his rise to power. Ultimately, Aziru's actions led to a significant shift in the balance of power in the region, with some chiefs benefiting from his rule and others suffering as a result of his expansionism."
