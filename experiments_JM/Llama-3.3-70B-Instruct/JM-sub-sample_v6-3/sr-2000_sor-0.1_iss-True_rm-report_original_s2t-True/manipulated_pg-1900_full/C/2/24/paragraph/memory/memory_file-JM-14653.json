In contrast, children still experience the wonder and joy of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what helps adults to pretend to feel the same way. The author argues that Christmas was not always a children's holiday, but was once a meaningful and exciting celebration for adults as well. The fact that children still believe in the magic of Christmas suggests that it was once a powerful and significant holiday for adults, who have since lost their faith and enthusiasm. The author believes that acknowledging the decline of Christmas is the first step to understanding and addressing the issue, rather than simply denying or ignoring it."

Despite this, the author argues that the core principles of faith, goodwill, and morality remain intact and are essential for humanity to live with dignity. The celebration of Christmas on December 25 was actually influenced by the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which symbolized the triumph of light over darkness and the birth of hope. The author suggests that the true meaning of Christmas is not about facts, but about the spirit of faith and goodwill that is necessary for human existence. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit is immortal and continues to be felt, even in modern times, as a reminder of the importance of mutual trust and fellowship in the face of life's mysteries and uncertainties."

Despite the decline of other faiths, the idea of universal goodwill is alive and vibrant, inspiring many literary artists and social reformers. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster faith in goodwill, providing a concrete symbol of an intangible idea. Christmas, with its traditions and spirit of peace and goodwill, is particularly well-suited to promote this faith, and its customs, such as gift-giving and sending cards, can be powerful expressions of sympathy and kindness. By embracing these traditions, people can reconnect with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood that underlies the holiday."

However, the author also emphasizes the importance of moderation and dignity, warning against taking excess to extremes. The author suggests that the spiritual benefits of feasting, including the acceptance of ridiculousness and the expansion of one's common sense, are essential to the human experience. To revitalize the Christmas festival, which has lost its old vitality, the author proposes focusing on the cultivation of goodwill, a element that unites people across different sects and beliefs. By concentrating on goodwill, the festival can acquire a fresh and genuine significance without overthrown traditions or causing controversy."

Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill in their own heart by thinking thoughts of kindness and compassion towards others. The author suggests starting with a small group of people, such as those in your daily life, and specializing in one person who often annoys you. To cultivate goodwill towards this person, one must use their imagination to understand and sympathize with their feelings, difficulties, and struggles. By doing so, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the other person, and ultimately increase their goodwill towards them."

Despite this, individuals will continue to strive for their goals and ideals, even if they seem unattainable, as it is human nature to do so. The concept of New Year's resolutions is explored, with the understanding that people will inevitably fall short of their ideals, but will continue to make new attempts, driven by their innate optimism and self-conceit. Ultimately, this cycle of striving and falling short is seen as a fundamental aspect of human nature, driven by a deep-seated desire to improve and live a fuller life."
