Section Summary: After returning from a holiday, Sir Joshua Reynolds opened a studio in St. Martin's Street and quickly gained success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received.

Section section_03 (Chars 17467–26069):
Section Summary: By 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds had established himself as a prominent painter, having already created many famous works and exhibited at the Society of Artists. He had also expanded his social circle, joining the Dilettanti Society and befriending notable figures such as Dr. Johnson. Reynolds' painting style had become characterized by strong drawing, firm modeling, and vibrant color, although he struggled with achieving permanent coloring. Despite his success, some of his works began to fade or crack over time, a fact that would later be lamented by critics. Reynolds' personal life was marked by a sense of calm and self-control, with friendships and acquaintances that spanned a wide range of society, including a close but seemingly platonic relationship with the artist Angelica Kaufmann.

Section section_04 (Chars 26070–34796):
Section Summary: After becoming the President of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds received the honor of knighthood in 1769, which solidified his social standing. He continued to paint, but at a slower pace, producing 70 portraits in 1771, and focused on enjoying life and fulfilling his duties as President. Reynolds traveled to the Low Countries multiple times, where he was exposed to the works of other artists, including Franz Hals, but remained indifferent to their influence. He continued to produce notable works, including portraits of General Oglethorpe, the Ladies Horatia, Laura, and Maria Waldegrave, and Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse. Despite some failures, such as "The Infant Hercules", Reynolds remained a prominent figure in the art world, receiving commissions from notable patrons, including Catherine, Empress of Russia.

Section section_05 (Chars 34796–43475):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' artistic career came to an end when he lost the use of one eye in 1789, and he spent his remaining years preparing for his death.

He passed away in 1792 at the age of 69, and his body was laid to rest in St. Paul's Cathedral.

Section section_06 (Chars 43476–47398):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children, although beautiful, lack a sense of realism and intimacy, suggesting that he had no deep interest in them as subjects. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' unique vision and comprehensive approach to portraiture set him apart from his contemporaries, making him the leading painter of great men in the 18th century. Unfortunately, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it difficult to appreciate his work in its original form. Despite this, Reynolds' reputation as a master artist remains, and his name is still revered in the art world.
