Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy, making it possible for the Allies to eventually defeat them. Russia's sacrifices and contributions to the war effort were crucial, as they diverted German and Austrian forces, allowing the Allies to prepare and counterattack. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but Russia's efforts, along with those of France, prevented this from happening. Ultimately, Russia's role in the war was instrumental in the Allied victory, and its sacrifices should not be overlooked."

By advancing into East Prussia, Russia diverted German troops from the French front, ultimately contributing to Germany's defeat in the First Battle of the Marne. German General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to downplay Russia's role and slander the Russian Army, but his accounts are false and misleading. In reality, Russia's sacrifices, including the loss of the Battle of Tannenberg, helped to divert German forces and secure the Allied victory. Russia's actions during the early weeks of the war were instrumental in preventing Germany's win, and their contributions should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts."

The Russian Army's victories, particularly at Warsaw in October 1914, forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers from the Western front to the Eastern front, abandoning their operations in France. This strategic shift compelled the Germans to adopt a defensive stance in the West for over a year, giving the Allies a significant advantage. Russia's efforts, although often underappreciated, played a decisive role in thwarting the German plan to crush France and ultimately changing the course of the war. By the end of 1914, the Germans were forced to triple their forces on the Russian front, further weakening their position in France."

In 1915, Russia's single-handed fight against Germany, Austria, and Turkey allowed France and England to prepare for the war and accumulate new reserves. The Russian front drew in German reserves, preventing them from being used in France, and ultimately contributed to the failure of the German offensive at Verdun. Ludendorf's memoirs acknowledge that the German Army was unable to crush the Russian Army, despite several attempts, and that the lack of reserves prevented them from fully exploiting their successes. The Russian Army's resistance in 1915 was a significant factor in the war, allowing the Allies to gain a crucial advantage and ultimately contributing to the German defeat."

The offensive led by General Brusilov in 1916, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of prisoners and significant trophies, forced the Austrians to abandon their offensive in Italy and transfer troops to the Russian front. This, in turn, allowed the Italians to launch a counter-offensive and relieved pressure on the French front, enabling the Allies to launch an offensive at the Somme. Russia's assistance to its allies continued in 1916, with the Russian Army providing support to the French at Verdun and later helping to defend Romania against invasion. The Russian Army's efforts ultimately weakened the German and Austro-Hungarian forces, setting the stage for a potential decisive victory in 1917."
