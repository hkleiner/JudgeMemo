Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" introduced the author to the concept of evolution and the idea that progress is a universal law that applies to all aspects of existence. The essay explains that progress is the result of differentiation, where simple things become complex through successive changes, and that this process is driven by the principle that every active force produces more than one change. The author notes that Spencer's work has had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and that his ideas have been widely assimilated into modern scientific thought. Overall, Spencer's philosophy of science emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the universal laws that govern their development."

He believed in the universality of law, applying to both the physical and mental realms, and that everything can be explained in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, Spencer also acknowledged the existence of an \"Unknowable\" or \"Unconditioned Reality\" that underlies all phenomena, which he saw as the ultimate source of all existence and activity. This concept is central to his philosophy, but its ambiguity and vagueness have led to criticism and confusion. Ultimately, Spencer's idea of the Unknowable differs from the scientific perspective, which avoids questions of ultimate origin and instead focuses on explaining phenomena within an orderly scheme."

Spencer distinguishes between the knowable effects of natural phenomena and their unknowable cause or source, which he calls the Unknowable. Bergson, on the other hand, draws a distinction between \"the evolved\" and \"evolution itself,\" and attributes the agency of evolution to Life. Both thinkers agree that the intellect can only provide a world of symbols, and that the ultimate reality or source of evolution can only be known through intuition. The discussion highlights the similarities and differences between Spencer's and Bergson's philosophical ideas, with both seeking to understand the source of change and evolution in the world."

In science, the concept of cause can be replaced by the idea of relatedness and change, where certain modes of relatedness imply certain kinds of change. The term \"energy\" is also often misunderstood as an active agent, but it can be seen as a constant ratio of variables that describes the changes in a system. The idea of \"force\" can be redefined as a measure of change or the degree of activity in a system, rather than a causal agent. Ultimately, the goal is to understand the meaning of these concepts clearly and avoid ambiguity in scientific interpretation."

As new modes of relatedness occur, new constitutive properties emerge that are not simply the sum of the properties of the component parts.

However, Spencer later recognized the limitations of a purely mechanical interpretation of nature, acknowledging the presence of specific vital characters in living organisms that cannot be conceived in physico-chemical terms. Spencer's view of cognition emphasizes the complex relationship between the organism and the environment, but his terminology and distinction between the external world and the mind are somewhat perplexing. An adequate analysis of cognitive relatedness on scientific lines is still lacking, and Spencer's teaching suggests that it must be dealt with in a strictly scientific manner, without resorting to non-scientific entities. Ultimately, understanding cognition requires a comprehensive approach that considers the complex interactions between external and internal relations, and the prior cognition that leads to behavior."

Cognition is characterized by awareness, but the author notes that it is unclear what exactly is being awareness of, and that science should approach this question by tracing the connections and implications of awareness. The author also critiques the concept of psycho-physical parallelism, arguing that it is a misleading term that oversimplifies the complex relationships between physiological and cognitive processes.
