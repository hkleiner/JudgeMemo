        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary education, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen due to their wealth or social status, but they lack the genuine love and understanding of literature that defines a true bookman. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless, meaningful works of literature."

The author holds these classic authors in high esteem, finding comfort and pleasure in re-reading their works, which offer a welcome respite from more modern and intense literature. They also praise Balzac as a master of French literature and the founder of the realistic school, whose works will endure long after many modern realists are forgotten. The author's love for classic literature is evident in their fond memories of reading and re-reading beloved books, such as Thackeray's \"Henry Esmond\" and Scott's \"Heart of Midlothian\"."

The author also imagines a holiday spent in a library, surrounded by books and a beautiful garden, as the perfect retreat. Additionally, the author fantasizes about hosting a meeting of bookmen, inviting historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Charles Lamb to share their passion for books."

A book lover's passion for collecting rare and beautiful books can lead to financial struggles and neglect of family responsibilities. The author draws a parallel between bibliomania and dipsomania, suggesting that the only cure for a bookman is total abstinence from buying rare books. Despite the best intentions, a bookman may struggle to resist the temptation of buying more books, often leading to clever attempts to hide new purchases from their spouse. Ultimately, the author portrays the bookman's wife as the sufferer and good angel, trying to intervene and save her family from the consequences of her husband's obsession."

As he grows older, the book collector becomes even more grateful for the comfort and wisdom of his books, which bring him peace and contentment. Ultimately, his love for books is a lifelong passion that brings him joy and fulfillment until the end of his life."
