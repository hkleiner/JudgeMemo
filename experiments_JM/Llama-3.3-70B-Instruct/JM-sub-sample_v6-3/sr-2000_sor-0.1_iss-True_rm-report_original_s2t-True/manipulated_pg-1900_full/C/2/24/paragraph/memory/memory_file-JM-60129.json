The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their language and culture showed similarities to Khirgis and Turkish, but they had no written language or recorded history."

The lamas living in the monastery are few, around 15, and are supported by voluntary contributions for their services as prayer-readers. The lamas are simple and poor, with limited knowledge of the Tangutan language and no involvement in medicine, instead relying on fortune-tellers to predict the future and pray for the sick.

They rode through the valleys of Kluadjek-gol and Mör-gol, following a narrow path with steep grassy slopes, and eventually arrived at the Lansor's or Neiman-gol valley. As they followed the river, they came across the Chinese town of Li-yen, also known as \"the garden of peartrees\", which was surrounded by picturesque hills and willow trees. The author was warmly received by the friendly old mandarin, who sent them a delicious dinner and showed them great courtesy. The author continued their journey the next day, riding to Kanchenp'u and then back to Kanchow."
