The narrator is eager to meet Vereker, a renowned author, and sees this as an opportunity to make a good impression. After writing the review, the narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unsure if he has read the review and is hesitant to bring it up. Vereker's pleasant and affable nature makes the narrator want him to read the review, which he believes does justice to his work. Ultimately, it is Lady Jane who brings attention to the review, praising it and potentially doing for the narrator what he couldn't do for himself."

Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the true point of his work. He confided in the narrator, sharing his feelings of being a failure despite his success, and the two connected over their shared love of literature. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kindness and sincerity, and his initial hurt was replaced by a deeper understanding and appreciation of the author."

However, Gwendolen Erme brought news that Corvick had sent a telegram from Bombay, claiming to have discovered Vereker's secret, which sparked the narrator's excitement and curiosity once again.

        "section_summary": "The narrator is seeking information about Hugh Vereker's secret, a general intention behind his books, which he believes was shared with George Corvick and then with Corvick's wife, Mrs. Deane. However, when the narrator approaches Mrs. Deane's husband, he discovers that the husband was not privy to this information, despite being married to her. The husband is genuinely unaware of Vereker's secret, which surprises the narrator and leads him to realize that Mrs. Deane did not think her husband worthy of sharing the information with. The narrator shares his own story of searching for Vereker's secret with the husband, who becomes increasingly interested and curious. The husband's newfound desire for knowledge creates a sense of solidarity between him and the narrator, who are now both driven by an unappeased desire to uncover Vereker's secret."
