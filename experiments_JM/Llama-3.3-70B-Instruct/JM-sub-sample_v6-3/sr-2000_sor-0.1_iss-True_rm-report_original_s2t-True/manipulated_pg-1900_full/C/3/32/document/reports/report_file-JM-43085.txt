Section section_01 (Chars 0–8472):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature to accurately depict scenes. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier's early life was marked by a humble beginning, with his father being a dealer in colonial products and chemicals. Meissonier's artistic talent was apparent from a young age, but his father, alarmed by the tumultuous art scene in France, initially discouraged his son's creative pursuits and instead apprenticed him as a druggist. However, Meissonier's passion for art prevailed, and he eventually pursued his artistic career. Meissonier's approach to art was characterized by his devotion to reality and his refusal to depict scenes he had not personally witnessed, such as battles.
