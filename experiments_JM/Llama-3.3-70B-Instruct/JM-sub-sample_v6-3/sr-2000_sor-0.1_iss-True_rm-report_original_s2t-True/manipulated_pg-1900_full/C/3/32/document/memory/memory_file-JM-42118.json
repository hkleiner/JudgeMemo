Growing up in a picturesque and romantic environment, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a career in painting. He was eventually allowed to follow his artistic bent, setting him on a path that would lead to his future success as a master painter."

Fragonard initially struggled under Chardin's tutelage, but after being dismissed, he spent time studying and painting the masterpieces in Parisian churches, which helped him improve significantly. He later returned to Boucher's studio, where he worked on decorative cartoons and enlargements for tapestries, receiving ideal training for his future career. Fragonard went on to win the Prix de Rome and spent time in Italy, where he was influenced by the works of Tiepolo and ultimately developed his own unique style. Through his experiences, Fragonard formed lasting friendships with artists Hubert Robert and the Abbé de Saint-Non, which helped spread his name and establish his reputation as a talented painter."

He initially painted in the academic style, but soon turned to depicting the life and beauty of his native France, which brought him great success. His painting \"Les hazards heureux de l'Escarpolette\" (The Happy Accidents of the Swing) became particularly famous, and he became the mirror of the court and the age of Du Barry. Fragonard's art was characterized by his love of landscape and his use of subjects as an excuse for glorious pictures of trees and natural settings. He went on to produce many works, becoming one of the great decorative painters of France, known for his ability to create delightful and pleasing pictures that brought joy to those who lived with them."

The rejection of his work did not hinder Fragonard's career, and he continued to produce exquisite pieces, eventually coming under the influence of Dutch landscapists. Fragonard's life took a turn when he married Marie Anne Gérard, and his art began to reflect the beauty of domestic life, as he painted scenes of family and rural surroundings. His marriage and newfound influences led to the creation of some of his most notable works, showcasing his unique genius and style."

Fragonard's life came to an end on August 22, 1806, when he died of brain congestion after becoming overheated on a sultry day. His legacy, along with that of other great painters like Watteau and Boucher, was initially neglected but has since been rediscovered and celebrated. Fragonard's art is seen as embodying the spirit of 18th-century France, capturing its elegance, gaiety, and romance, and serving as a lasting testament to the era's beauty and significance."
