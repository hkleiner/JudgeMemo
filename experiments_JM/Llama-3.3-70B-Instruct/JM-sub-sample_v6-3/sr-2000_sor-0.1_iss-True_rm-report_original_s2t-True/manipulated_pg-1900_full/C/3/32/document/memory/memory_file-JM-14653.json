        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder and enthusiasm of Christmas, but adults have lost some of that faith and excitement, and now often view the holiday as a time of indulgence and obligation. The author argues that this decline in the significance of Christmas is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. This has led to a decline in faith and a focus on facts, causing people to question the validity of Christmas and its traditions. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, such as faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are essential for human dignity and existence. The celebration of Christmas on December 25th, coinciding with the winter solstice, is a symbolic moment that represents the triumph of light over darkness and the birth of hope. Despite the changes in human understanding and knowledge, the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas remains a constant and essential part of human experience."

Despite differences, people are coming together to promote social justice, which is a testament to the power of faith in goodwill. Celebrating festivals like Christmas is essential to foster and express this faith, as it provides a concrete symbol of our shared values and promotes a sense of community and brotherhood. The traditions and customs of Christmas, such as exchanging gifts and cards, are designed to symbolize the spirit of peace and goodwill, and can be a powerful way to connect with others and express our faith in humanity. By embracing these traditions with sincerity and imagination, we can rekindle our faith in goodwill and promote a more harmonious and compassionate world."

While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and connect with others. The author also critiques the idea of replacing traditional Christmas celebrations with more modern or intellectual pursuits, arguing that festivals are affairs of the emotions, not the intellect. Instead, the author suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas festival is to focus on cultivating goodwill among people, which is a core element of the holiday's spirit. By doing so, the festival can regain its genuine significance and become more than just a perfunctory tradition."

Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those who annoy or challenge them the most. The key to cultivating goodwill is to use one's imagination to understand and sympathize with others, putting oneself in their shoes and reflecting on their experiences with empathy. This requires effort and a willingness to set aside one's own biases and prejudices, but it can lead to deeper connections and greater understanding. By practicing goodwill towards those around them, individuals can create a positive impact without needing to advertise their intentions or join large organizations."

As a result, one's relationships with friends and acquaintances become more meaningful, and even everyday interactions, such as gift-giving and celebrations like Christmas, take on a deeper significance. The author argues that this practice can ultimately lead to an increase in one's own happiness, as it fosters a sense of companionship and mutual understanding. By cultivating goodwill, one can transform their relationships and find greater joy and appreciation in life's experiences."

Ultimately, the decision to find life worth living despite its drawbacks is a personal one, and many people are motivated by the \"golden moments\" of life and the joy of human friendship."
