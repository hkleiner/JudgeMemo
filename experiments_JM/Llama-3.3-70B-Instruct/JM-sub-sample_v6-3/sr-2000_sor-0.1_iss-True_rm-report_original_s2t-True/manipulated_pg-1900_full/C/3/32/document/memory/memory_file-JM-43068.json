        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. Millet's style is influenced by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a 16th-century painter who is now recognized as a great master of peasant painting. Unlike Brueghel's contemporaries, such as Adrian Brouwer and Jan Steen, Millet's work is marked by a more subdued and melancholic tone, reflecting the changing times and the struggles of the French peasant. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" are not sentimental but rather a truthful and earnest depiction of peasant life, conveying the importance of religion and the struggle for existence. Overall, Millet's unique style and approach to painting have secured his place as a significant figure in the world of art."

His artwork often featured lonely, laborious scenes, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", which highlighted the monotony and importance of rural work. Millet's brush was a means to an end, used to illustrate his philosophical observations and convey a message rather than showcase technical skill. He was particularly inspired by the spring season and the themes of hard work, duty, and the cycle of life. Millet's unique approach to art, prioritizing meaning over technical brilliance, sets him apart from other painters and makes his work enduring and thought-provoking."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Normandy and grew up surrounded by the harsh yet beautiful landscape, which would later influence his art. His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing significant roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family encouraged his artistic pursuits. He eventually began to develop his skills as an artist, laying the foundation for his future success, before making the decision to leave for Paris to pursue his artistic career."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm to manage it, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue his artistic passion, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to support his move to Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre and developed his own unique style. However, his time in Paris was not without challenges, and he struggled to find his place in the art world, even briefly studying with the unsuitable Delaroche. Ultimately, Millet was freed to pursue his own artistic vision, despite the difficulties of poverty and the dominant artistic styles of the time."

However, his health began to decline due to a persistent cough, and he eventually passed away on January 20, 1875. Millet's art is characterized by his passionate sympathy with the common people, particularly peasants, and his ability to convey the struggles and hardships of their daily lives. His work had a profound influence on other artists, including Segantini, and his sincere and profound art continues to be admired for its purity and truth. Millet's legacy is that of a poet, philosopher, and great thinker who expressed himself through his art, leaving a lasting impact on the world."
