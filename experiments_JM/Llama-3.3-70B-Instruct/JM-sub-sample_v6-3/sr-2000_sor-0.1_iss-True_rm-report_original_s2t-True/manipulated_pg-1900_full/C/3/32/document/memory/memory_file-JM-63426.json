Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style that was bold, free, and exuberant. The chapter \"The Boy Printer of Ishpeming\" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, growing up in Lynn, Massachusetts, and later moving to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he developed an interest in art and printing. Bradley's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was driven to pursue his passion for art and design. Through his determination and talent, Bradley went on to become a pioneering figure in American graphic arts, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire new generations of artists and designers."

After saving enough money, he traveled to Chicago to pursue his dream of becoming an artist, where he met Frank Bromley, a landscape painter who introduced him to Rand McNally. However, his first attempt at working at Rand McNally was unsuccessful, and he returned to his printing job in Northern Michigan. A few months later, he returned to Chicago and was rehired at Rand McNally, where he worked in exchange for a small wage.

This experience influenced his typographic style, and he became a member of the Arts and Crafts society, contributing to its first exhibition. The author's use of Caslon typeface was initially met with criticism, but it eventually gained popularity, and he established the Wayside Press, where he printed his first project, a Strathmore deckle-edge sample book.

However, the author soon found himself overwhelmed and struggling to manage the business, leading to a breakdown and the eventual closure of the Wayside Press. The author then moved to New York, where he attempted to start a new magazine and sought out the writer Richard Harding Davis, who agreed to write a story for the magazine without expecting payment. The author's encounter with Davis was a highlight of his time in New York, and marked a new chapter in his career as a designer, printer, and publisher."

The author reflects on the current state of illustration and design, praising modern illustrators and their use of imaginative composition and color.

        "section_summary": "Will Bradley, a renowned designer, retired at the age of 62 in 1930. A quarter-century later, his work was celebrated with the 1954 Portfolio in the Strathmore designer series, which was introduced at a luncheon with notable speakers paying tribute to his accomplishments. The book about Bradley's life and work was assembled from separate papers he wrote between 1949 and 1951, with some editing to create a continuous narrative. The project was a cooperative effort, with significant contributions from Peter Beilenson, who helped with design, printing, and editing. Despite his advanced age, Bradley offered to develop the typographic plan and rewrite the text, but his original recollections were deemed sufficient to reflect his remarkable career."
