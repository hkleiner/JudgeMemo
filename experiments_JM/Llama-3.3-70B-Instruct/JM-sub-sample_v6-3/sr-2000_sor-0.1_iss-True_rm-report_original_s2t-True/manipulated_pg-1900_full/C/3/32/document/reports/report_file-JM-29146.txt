Section section_01 (Chars 0–8004):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government has taken this step to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships, and to charge high prices for it. Ramsey, now stranded on Irwadi, must find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene. He has some savings to tide him over, but his future is uncertain.

The Irwadi Security Officer, Chind Ramar, informs the crew and passengers that they will be stranded indefinitely, causing anger and resignation among them. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, tries to help his friend Stu Englander, who is struggling financially, by giving him 375 credits to support his family. Ramsey then visits a gaming table, but loses most of his money and is left with only three credits. He encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who challenges him, but Ramsey remains calm and uninterested in escalating the situation.

Section section_10 (Chars 72949–81134):
Section Summary: Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with a being known as proto-man, which makes him realize that humanity is not ready for the power of matter-transmission. He tries to stop Margot from reaching a black box that contains the secret of matter-transmission, but Garr Symm intervenes and jumps into the box, which transforms him into a primitive, caveman-like creature. Vardin, a being who is a guardian of the galaxy, explains that her ancestors discovered the power of matter-transmission but did not understand it, and it ultimately led to their downfall. Ramsey and Margot escape the planet, and Vardin disappears, leaving them to return to their ship and blast off into space.
