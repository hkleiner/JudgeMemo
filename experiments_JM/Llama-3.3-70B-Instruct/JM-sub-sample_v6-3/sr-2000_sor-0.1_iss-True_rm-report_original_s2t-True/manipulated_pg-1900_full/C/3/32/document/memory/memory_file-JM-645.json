Corvick warns the narrator not to simply praise Vereker as \"awfully clever\", but to try to truly understand and critique his work. The narrator writes the review, but later feels uncertain about its quality, especially after Corvick expresses disappointment with it. The narrator meets Vereker at the social gathering, but doesn't get a chance to discuss the review with him, although Lady Jane eventually brings it up and praises the narrator's work."

Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the true point of his work. He confided in the narrator, sharing his feelings of being a failure despite his success, and the two connected over their shared love of literature.

However, the man claims he has no knowledge of such a secret, despite the narrator's assumption that his wife would have shared it with him. The narrator is shocked and disappointed, realizing that Mrs. Deane must not have thought her husband worthy of trusting with the information. The narrator then shares his own story of trying to uncover Vereker's secret, and the man listens with growing attention and curiosity. The man's desire to know the secret is now ignited, and the narrator finds some consolation in the fact that they are both victims of unappeased desire."
