Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin.

As Davy describes the scene, Anthony is inspired to play his violin, and the music fills the air with harmony and beauty. Anthony's past is also revealed, showing his dislike for school and his love for music and the outdoors, which ultimately led him to become a skilled violinist despite losing his eyesight."

Despite being considered lazy by the villagers, Tony was actually a diligent and industrious learner, teaching himself about music, instruments, and repair. He developed a particular passion for music and instruments, and by the age of 15, had taken apart and repaired numerous instruments in the village. Through his self-directed learning, Tony gained a unique set of skills and knowledge that set him apart from his peers."

As he worked, Anthony was driven by a desire to create something beautiful and to use his gifts to make a positive impact on the world. He was inspired by the example of Antonius Stradivarius, a master violin maker, and sought to follow in his footsteps by cherishing his sight and touch and striving for perfection in his work. Through his dedication and hard work, Anthony was able to develop a deep understanding of music and the art of violin making, despite his limited formal education."

Despite Lyddy's troubled past and Anthony's disability, they found love and comfort in each other, with Anthony seeing beyond Lyddy's physical appearance and loving her for who she truly was. As they sat together in the apple orchard, Anthony worked on composing music using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs, which Lyddy would transcribe into written form. The music was a reflection of their love and the beauty of nature surrounding them, with Lyddy interpreting it as a dream of the future and a celebration of new life and hope. In this peaceful and idyllic setting, Lyddy and Anthony shared a deep connection and love for each other, with their relationship filled with joy, promise, and sweetness."
