Section section_05 (Chars 34929–43507):
Section Summary: The Philippines has two extremes of life: one of ease and leisure, and the other of simplicity and hardship. The wealthy Filipinos live in large, polished houses with many servants, while the poor, known as the "tao", live in humble homes and struggle to find enough food to eat. The tao's diet consists mainly of rice and fish, which they eat with their hands, and they often go hungry. In contrast, the middle class of Filipinos fills the gap between the rich and the poor, with a more moderate lifestyle. The author also describes a visit to a leper colony, where they received a hostile reception from the inhabitants, highlighting the challenges and hardships faced by those living on the margins of society.
