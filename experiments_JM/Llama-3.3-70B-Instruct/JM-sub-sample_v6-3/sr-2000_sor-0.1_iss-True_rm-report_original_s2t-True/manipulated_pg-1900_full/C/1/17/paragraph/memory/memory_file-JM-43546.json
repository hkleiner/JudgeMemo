The main story starts with Donald, a young Scottish boy, finding a lost puppy in a lane near his home and deciding to take it in. He shows the puppy to his friend Sandy and then to his parents, who advise him to try to find the puppy's owner by advertising it in the paper and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he is excited at the prospect of training it to be a sheep-dog. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, discussing the puppy and making plans to visit Donald's uncle for a birthday party celebration."
