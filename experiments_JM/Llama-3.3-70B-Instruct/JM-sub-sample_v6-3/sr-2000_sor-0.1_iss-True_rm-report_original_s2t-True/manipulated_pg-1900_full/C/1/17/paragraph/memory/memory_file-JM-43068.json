        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among other great artists of his time. His work is characterized by a profound understanding of the struggles and simplicity of rural life, which he experienced firsthand through his own life of struggle and hardship. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" are marked by a sense of earnestness and melancholy truth, capturing the dignity and poverty of peasant life. Despite some critics labeling his work as sentimental, Millet's art is a powerful portrayal of the human struggle and the importance of religious faith in the lives of rural people. His unique style and perspective were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters and his own gentle disposition."

To fully appreciate his work, one must be familiar with the countryside he depicted, as the subtleties of atmosphere and line are unique to each region. Millet's paintings often capture the loneliness and simplicity of peasant life, highlighting the importance of their labor and daily struggles. He is more of a philosopher than a painter, using his brush to illustrate the fruits of his observations and convey a deeper meaning. Millet's greatness lies in his ability to portray the human side of rural life, making his paintings more than just technical exercises, but rather a window into the lives of the people he depicted."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing amidst the rugged and picturesque landscape had a profound impact on his artistic style. Millet's family encouraged his early interest in drawing, and his father even took him to meet a local painter, Mouchel, to showcase his work. As he grew older, Millet developed his skills through self-study and practice, drawing inspiration from the people and landscapes around him, as well as from literature and the Bible. Eventually, Millet's talent and passion for art led him to leave his rural home and migrate to Paris to pursue a career in the arts."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his passion for art led him to continue his studies in Cherbourg and later in Paris, where he was influenced by the works of Mantegna, Michel Angelo, and Nicolas Poussin. In Paris, Millet briefly studied under Delaroche, but their styles clashed, and he eventually stopped attending the studio due to neglect and financial difficulties. Despite the challenges, Delaroche secretly admired Millet's talent and provided him with financial assistance. Freed from his obligations, Millet was determined to pursue his artistic vision, but he faced significant struggles to make a living from his work, which was not yet appreciated by the public."

Despite facing rejection and financial difficulties, he continued to produce art, including classical and peasant-themed works, and eventually became a regular contributor to the Salon. In 1848, he moved to Barbizon, where he found a more suitable environment to focus on his art, surrounded by like-minded artists such as Rousseau. Millet's life in Barbizon was marked by simplicity and tranquility, allowing him to devote himself to his work and produce some of his most notable pieces. He found inspiration in the everyday lives of peasants, which became a central theme in his art, and was able to live a happy and fulfilling life surrounded by nature and friends."

His paintings were initially sold for low prices, but later became highly valued, with \"The Angelus\" being sold for 800,000 francs. Millet's later years were marked by personal losses, including the death of his friend Rousseau, and declining health, which ultimately led to his death on January 20, 1875. Throughout his life, Millet remained true to his artistic vision, driven by his genius and passion, despite the challenges he faced."
