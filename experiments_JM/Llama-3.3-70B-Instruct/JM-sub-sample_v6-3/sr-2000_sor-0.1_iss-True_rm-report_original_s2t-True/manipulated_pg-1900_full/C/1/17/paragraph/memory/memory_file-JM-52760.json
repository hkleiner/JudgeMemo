Despite various Union generals' attempts to capture Richmond, the war remained unresolved, with Confederate General Lee successfully defending the city. In 1864, Union General Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to lead the Union armies and devised a two-pronged attack, with General William T. Sherman targeting the Confederate Army of Tennessee and Grant focusing on Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Grant's campaign began with a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but ultimately shifted to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for Richmond. The siege of Petersburg marked a turning point in the war, as Grant's strategy aimed to isolate Richmond and wear down Lee's army, ultimately leading to the city's fall."

The city's capture would have severely impacted the Confederacy's ability to supply its troops, making it a key target for Union forces. In June 1864, Union troops under General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the city's defenses, known as the Dimmock Line. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederate troops were able to hold off the initial attacks, but were eventually forced to withdraw to new positions closer to the city. The Union forces continued to press the attack, but were ultimately unable to break through the Confederate lines, leading to a prolonged siege of the city."

On June 22-24, a Union attempt to capture the Weldon Railroad was repelled by the Confederates, but the Union lines were extended across the Jerusalem Plank Road, cutting off its use to the city. The Union plan was to reduce Petersburg by a process of attrition, which would last for 9 months, but some troops were also working on a unique plan to take the city by direct assault, including digging a mine shaft under the Confederate lines. The 48th Regiment, Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteer Infantry, led by Lt. Col. Henry Pleasants, began digging the mine shaft on June 25, with the goal of blowing up the Confederate position and creating a gap in the enemy's line."

The explosion was followed by a Union charge, but the attack was delayed and disorganized, allowing the Confederates to rally and counterattack. Despite initial gains, the Union troops became mired in the crater, where they were subjected to heavy artillery and mortar fire, and were ultimately unable to break through the Confederate lines.
