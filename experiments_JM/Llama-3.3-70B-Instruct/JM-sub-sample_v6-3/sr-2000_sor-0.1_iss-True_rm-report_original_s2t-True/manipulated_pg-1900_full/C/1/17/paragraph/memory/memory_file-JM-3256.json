        "section_summary": "The section \"BOOKS AND BOOKMEN\" explores the difference between a book owner and a true bookman, highlighting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A bookman is someone who has a deep love and appreciation for books, and is not just a collector. The author illustrates this point through a personal anecdote about a wealthy host who owns an impressive library, but is not a true bookman. The section also touches on the idea that a critic's role is to distinguish between books that are fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact on the human mind. Ultimately, a true bookman is someone who values the content and wisdom of books, rather than just their physical appearance or monetary value."

He values books that are well-written and bring the past to life, and is not concerned with whether the writer's views are respectable or accurate. The bookman's love affair with literature began with classic novels like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\", and he later discovered authors like Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens. He returns to these favorite authors again and again, finding comfort and pleasure in their works. The bookman also admires French literature, particularly Balzac, who he considers the master of the realistic school and a founder of the art."

The concept of the \"swinging pendulum\" in history is discussed, where every idea or institution eventually gives way to its opposite. The writer also waxes poetic about the joys of book collecting and rearranging one's library, finding delight in handling and reading old books. A fantasy meeting of bookmen is imagined, featuring historical figures such as Cosmo Medici and Mary Queen of Scots, who would gather to discuss and share their love of books. The writer's passion for literature and book collecting is evident throughout, highlighting the timeless pleasure and satisfaction of immersing oneself in great works of fiction."

It tells the story of a bookman who is infected with the \"book disease\" from his father and becomes obsessed with collecting rare and valuable books. The bookman will make sacrifices to obtain the books he desires, and his love for books is compared to a disease that cannot be cured. The passage also touches on the idea that book lovers will go to great lengths to acquire the books they want, often justifying their purchases as a way to build a legacy for their families. Ultimately, the bookman's obsession with books is portrayed as a charming and relatable quirk."
