Section section_05 (Chars 33333–41968):
Section Summary: The author's interest in typography, particularly the Caslon typeface, was sparked by a visit to the Boston Public Library in 1895, where he discovered a collection of colonial-era books. This experience had a profound influence on his approach to typography, and he soon became a member of the Arts and Crafts Society of Boston.

The press's first project was a sample book for the Strathmore Paper Company, which marked a new approach to showcasing paper samples and helped to establish the Wayside Press as a innovative force in the printing industry.
