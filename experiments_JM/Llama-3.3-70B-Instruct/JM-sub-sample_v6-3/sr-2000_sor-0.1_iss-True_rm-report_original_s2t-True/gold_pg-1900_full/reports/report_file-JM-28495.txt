Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief from a street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and humorous.

Section Summary: Stella and the narrator attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but their pursuit was unsuccessful and they ended up exhausted and discomfited.

They took the puppy in and spent several days deciding on a name, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grew up, he became a unique and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and exhibiting a persistent and determined personality.

Section section_03 (Chars 16453–24740):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but dim-witted companion. Despite being told to go home, Excalibur insists on following the narrator, and his persistence eventually earns him a scolding. Excalibur is a gentle giant, fond of children and babies, and is often the subject of playful games and activities. He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then forgets where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often cause embarrassment, as when he hides a bone in a cushion at a dinner party, but his affectionate nature makes him a beloved member of the family.

Section section_04 (Chars 24741–32990):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various friends and acquaintances. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, who was having breakfast. Eileen followed and introduced herself, and the curate was immediately smitten with her. As Eileen and the curate spent more time together, Excalibur found himself acting as a chaperon, and his usual routine was disrupted, including his favorite spot on the tennis lawn, which was now being used for tennis matches between Eileen and the curate. Excalibur was good-natured about the changes, but his slow mind and forgiving nature made him a patient, if sometimes bewildered, observer of the new developments.

Section section_05 (Chars 32990–41195):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a gentle creature, often found himself in awkward situations while accompanying Eileen and the curate on their outings, including a game of golf where he was struck by balls and a country walk where he encountered a hare. Meanwhile, Eileen and the curate were preoccupied with their own concerns, discussing the curate's limited financial prospects and the challenges of living on a small income. The curate decided that he must leave the village to find work in London, where he can make a better life for himself and Eileen. The pair agreed to keep their plans a secret, sharing a cheerful but likely forced smile as they parted ways. Excalibur, oblivious to their conversation, remained focused on his own comfort and avoiding further mishaps.
