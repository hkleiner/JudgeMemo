Spencer's essay outlined the concept of evolution, where the simple develops into the complex through successive differentiations, and this law applies to all aspects of existence, from the universe to human society. The author was drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, leading to a higher level of complexity and progress. Spencer's work had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and his contributions are still recognized today. The author notes that while Spencer's focus on biological relationships was a strength, it also led to a narrowness of intent that sometimes limited his perspective on other important relationships."

Despite this, his philosophy had a significant impact, and he is remembered for his contributions to the concept of evolution as a universal principle. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the idea of a universal law governing all things, from matter and motion to mind and society. He also introduced the concept of the \"Unknowable,\" a fundamental reality that underlies all existence, but is beyond human comprehension. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy aimed to provide a unified understanding of the world, but his ideas about the Unknowable have been subject to interpretation and criticism."

The two philosophers differ in their approaches, with Bergson criticizing Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution from the fragments of the evolved. Spencer's philosophy of science emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, but his statements on this topic are often puzzling and ambiguous. Ultimately, Spencer's thought is underpinned by the notion of a noumenal Source of phenomena, which is beyond human understanding."

Clifford, who argued that an exact knowledge of facts can supersede the need to inquire about their causes. In science, relatedness and change are key concepts, and simple types of relatedness, such as gravitation, can be expressed in formulae that describe the rate of change. The idea of energy as an active agent that produces change is also problematic, and a more modern understanding of energy as a constant ratio of variables is preferred. The author suggests replacing the word \"cause\" with \"source\" to remove ambiguity and using the term \"effective\" to describe modes of relatedness that imply certain changes. Ultimately, the concept of force can be understood as a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness, rather than an active agent that produces change."

The author argues that Spencer's attempt to explain the cognitive relation is ambiguous and perplexing, and that an adequate analysis of cognitive relatedness is not found in his works.

In the case of biological organisms, cognitive processes imply a higher type of relatedness that is grounded in the constitution of the organism and is selective, implying a relationship to prior experience. Awareness is a characteristic feature of cognitive knowledge, but it is unclear what exactly is being awareness of, whether it be the cognitive relation itself, the underlying cortical process, or something else.

Instead, the author suggests that cognitive relatedness is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves the relatedness of many terms and is effective in bringing about changes in the system. The author concludes that Spencer's work, although influential, failed to bring cognition and conscious awareness into close touch with the rest of his philosophy of science, and that a more satisfactory approach is needed to understand this complex phenomenon. Ultimately, the author emphasizes the importance of treating cognitive relatedness as a natural phenomenon that can be studied scientifically, rather than invoking immaterial or non-physical entities."
