        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has lost its magic and excitement for adults, who now have to force themselves to enjoy the holiday. In contrast, children still experience the wonder and joy of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what helps adults to pretend to feel the same way. The author argues that Christmas was not always a children's holiday, but was once a meaningful and exciting celebration for adults as well. The fact that children still believe in the magic of Christmas suggests that it was once a powerful and significant holiday for adults, who have since lost their faith and enthusiasm. The author believes that acknowledging the decline of Christmas is the first step to understanding and addressing the issue, rather than simply denying or ignoring it."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. This has led to a decline in faith and a sense of uncertainty, causing people to question the meaning of Christmas. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, such as faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are still essential for humanity to live with dignity and purpose. The celebration of Christmas on December 25 was actually influenced by the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which symbolized the triumph of light over darkness and the birth of hope. Despite the changes in human understanding and the passage of time, the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas remains a timeless and universal concept."

Despite differences, people are coming together to promote social justice, which is the practice of goodwill and recognition of the brotherhood of mankind. The idea of universal goodwill is alive and thriving, inspiring many to work towards a better world. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster this faith in goodwill, providing a concrete symbol of an intangible idea. By participating in Christmas traditions, such as gift-giving and good-wishing, people can reaffirm their commitment to goodwill and mutual support."

While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and connect with others. The author also critiques the idea of replacing traditional Christmas celebrations with more modern or intellectual pursuits, arguing that festivals are affairs of the emotions, not the intellect. Instead, the author suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas festival is to focus on cultivating goodwill among people, which is a core element of the holiday's spirit. By doing so, the festival can regain its genuine significance and become more than just a perfunctory tradition."

Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those who annoy or challenge them the most. This can be done by using imagination to understand and sympathize with the other person's feelings and experiences. By doing so, one can build genuine connections and increase goodwill, which is essential for human happiness. The author emphasizes that this process requires effort, self-reflection, and a willingness to understand others, rather than just going through the motions of being polite or charitable."

As a result, one's relationships with friends and acquaintances become more meaningful and interesting, and even everyday interactions, such as gift-giving and celebrations like Christmas, take on a new significance. The author argues that this cultivation of goodwill can ultimately lead to an increase in one's own happiness. By practicing sympathetic imagination, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of others, leading to a more fulfilling and joyful life."
