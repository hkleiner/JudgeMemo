        "section_summary": "By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to ending the war, as it would cut off supplies to Richmond and likely lead to the city's abandonment."

The city's defenses, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates, led by General Beauregard, were initially outnumbered but received reinforcements from General Lee, and the battle continued for several days with intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces ultimately failed to break through the Confederate lines, and the battle became a prolonged siege of the city."

The Confederate defense line held, and the Union army was forced to settle for a siege, with 111,000 to 113,000 Union troops facing 47,000 to 51,000 Confederates. The Union army then attempted to encircle Petersburg, with a failed attempt to capture the Weldon Railroad on June 22-24, but this marked the beginning of a series of attempts to encircle the city. A unique plan was devised by a group of Union soldiers, led by Lt. Col. Henry Pleasants, to dig a mine shaft under the Confederate lines and blow it up, which was approved by Grant and began on June 25. The mine shaft, which was completed on July 27, was a remarkable feat of engineering, with a ventilation system that allowed the diggers to work in a long tunnel without suffocating."

Despite the initial success, the Union army's subsequent charge was delayed and disorganized, allowing the Confederates to regroup and counterattack, ultimately repelling the Union forces. The battle resulted in a significant Union defeat, with over 4,000 casualties, compared to around 1,500 for the Confederates. The failed assault marked another unsuccessful attempt by the Union army to breach the Confederate stronghold at Petersburg."

Grant's strategy shifted to extending his siege lines and cutting off Lee's supply lines, starting with the capture of the Weldon Railroad in August. The Union army made further gains in late September and October, including the capture of Fort Harrison and the extension of their lines west of the Weldon Railroad, but were unable to cut off Lee's railroad supply lines. The Confederates continued to resist, but their defense lines were becoming increasingly thin and vulnerable to Union attacks."

The Union army continued to push west, extending their lines and forcing the Confederates to lengthen their defenses, which now stretched over 37 miles.

Lee considered three options: negotiating peace terms, retreating from Richmond and Petersburg to unite with Johnston, or attacking Grant to facilitate a retreat. He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union work near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through the Union lines and allow his army to retreat. The attack, led by General Gordon, initially succeeded in capturing the fort, but was ultimately repelled by Union forces, resulting in over 4,000 Confederate casualties. The failed attack left Lee with only one option: to retreat, as Grant was planning to launch a final assault on the Confederate lines."

The next morning, Union troops discovered that the Southern earthworks had been abandoned, and they took possession of Petersburg and Richmond.
