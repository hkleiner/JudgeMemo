        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and focuses on reading the classics, such as Shakespeare and Milton, demonstrates a more authentic connection to literature. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless, meaningful works of literature."

As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, and the classics - Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works remain a staple in their library. The author holds a special place for Thackeray's \"Henry Esmond\" and Scott's \"Heart of Midlothian\", two books that they revisit annually, and struggles to choose between the two due to their unique charms. These classic novels offer a sense of comfort and pleasure, allowing the author to escape the intensity of modern literature. The author ultimately concludes that both Thackeray and Scott are masters of their craft, each with their own strengths and memorable characters."

The text then shifts to the bookman's love of rearranging his books, finding joy in the process of organizing and rediscovering favorite passages and authors. The author imagines a gathering of bookmen, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Mary Queen of Scots, to share their passion for books and literature. Ultimately, the section celebrates the delight of immersing oneself in a personal library, surrounded by the spirit of books and the beauty of nature."

A bookman's obsession with books can lead to neglect of his family and finances, with his wife often suffering as a result. The author draws a parallel between bibliomania and dipsomania, suggesting that the only cure for a bookman is total abstinence from buying rare or expensive books. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to make sacrifices and even practice deceit to obtain the books he desires."
