Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings.

After arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with difficulty, including a misleading suggestion from a street boy to "bite a policeman." They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including encounters with shopkeepers and pedestrians.
