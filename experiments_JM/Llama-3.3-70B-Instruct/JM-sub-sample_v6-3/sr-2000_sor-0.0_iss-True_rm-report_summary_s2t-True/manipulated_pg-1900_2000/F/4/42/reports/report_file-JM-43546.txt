Section section_01 (Chars 0–8145):
Section Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his parents, and they decide to try to find the owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station, but if no one claims it, Donald can keep it. The family enjoys afternoon tea together, discussing the puppy and making plans for a future visit to Donald's uncle's home, where they will celebrate his cousin Marjorie's birthday. The boys are excited about the upcoming visit and the possibility of learning about sheep-dogs and shepherding from Donald's uncle.
