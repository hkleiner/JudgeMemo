        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point through anecdotes, including a story about a wealthy man who owns an impressive library but lacks a genuine love for books, and a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognizes the value of classic literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both high and low literature, and that the ability to distinguish between truly great books and fleeting popular novels is a key characteristic of a true bookman. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, discerning reader who can appreciate the timeless classics of English literature."

A true book lover, or \"bookman,\" can distinguish between these two types of books and appreciates those that have a classic quality, enriching the human mind and speaking to all ages. According to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, a classic book is one that has wisdom, a unique style, and transcends the limitations of its time. A bookman's taste is eclectic and not limited by subject matter, and they value books that have a timeless quality, such as the works of Bunyan, Milton, and A'Kempis. Ultimately, a bookman seeks to collect and cherish books that are like cathedrals, providing inspiration and peace for generations to come."
