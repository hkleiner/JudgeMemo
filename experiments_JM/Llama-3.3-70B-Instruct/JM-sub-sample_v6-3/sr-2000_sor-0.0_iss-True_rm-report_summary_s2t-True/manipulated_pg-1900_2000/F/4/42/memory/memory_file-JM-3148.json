        "section_summary": "The teacher often struggled to keep her students engaged, especially on hot afternoons, and Anthony would sometimes sneak out of the window to play with a tuning fork. As he grew older, Anthony was considered the laziest boy in the village, but this was because he was more interested in pursuing his own interests and learning through personal experience. He was a curious boy, always asking questions about the world around him, such as why the sun drives away the stars and what makes seeds grow. Despite not being in school for the full year, Anthony educated himself by exploring the woods and learning about nature, discovering hidden gems like Mayflowers and rare flowers. He spent his free time listening to and imitating the sounds of wild birds, demonstrating his unique and self-directed approach to learning."
