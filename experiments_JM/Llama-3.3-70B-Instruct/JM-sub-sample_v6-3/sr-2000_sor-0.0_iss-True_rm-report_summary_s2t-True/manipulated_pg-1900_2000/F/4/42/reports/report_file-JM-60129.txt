Section section_01 (Chars 0–8346):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their houses were built in Chinese style, with only a few being considered poor.

Section section_02 (Chars 8346–12732):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people's homes were traditionally Chinese, with a sleeping stove, Buddhist altar, and Chinese-style utensils. Their clothing was also influenced by Chinese fashion, but made from home-spun materials, with men wearing long coats, fur coats, and trousers, and women wearing similar dresses with distinctive headpieces. The women's headpieces were decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings, and were only worn by married women. The Yögur people had limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items. They engaged in basic handicrafts like weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men making baskets and knitting stockings.
