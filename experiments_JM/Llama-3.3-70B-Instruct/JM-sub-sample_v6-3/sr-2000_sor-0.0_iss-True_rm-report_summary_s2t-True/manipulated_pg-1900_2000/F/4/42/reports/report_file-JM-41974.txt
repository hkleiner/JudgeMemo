Section Summary: Veronese, born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, was a great painter known for his absurd yet adorable style, which disregarded logic and historical truth in favor of vibrant colors and fantasy. He was trained by his uncle, Antonio Badile, and developed his skills through diligent practice and study of masters like Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden. Veronese's early works already showed promise, and he quickly gained recognition in Verona and beyond, including a commission from Cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga to paint a picture for the cathedral at Mantua. He eventually outgrew the limitations of his native city and moved to Venice, where he became the chosen painter of the Most Serene Republic, capturing the city's splendor and joy in his works. Veronese's unique style, which blended fantasy and reality, has made him one of the most celebrated painters of all time.
