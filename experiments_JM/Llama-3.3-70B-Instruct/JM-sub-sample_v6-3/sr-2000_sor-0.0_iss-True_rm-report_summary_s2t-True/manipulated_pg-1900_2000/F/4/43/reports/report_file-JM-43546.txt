Section section_01 (Chars 0–7923):
Section Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his parents, and they decide to care for it until they can find its owner, with the possibility of keeping it if no one claims it. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, complete with shortbread, scones, and other sweet treats. Donald is excited to learn that his family will be visiting his uncle, Alan, soon, and he hopes to learn about training the puppy as a sheep-dog from his uncle's experiences.

Section section_02 (Chars 7923–11783):
Section Summary: When Mrs. Gordon announced that their cousins, Janet and Marjorie, would be visiting, Don and Sandy were overjoyed. The boys began planning all the fun activities they would do together, with Don sharing stories of his uncle's estate, Skylemore, in the Highlands. Uncle Alan, who had made a fortune in America, had returned to Scotland and bought a beautiful estate with a big park, woodland, and a loch, where Don had many exciting adventures. Don loved hearing his uncle's stories about his life in America, including tales of Indians, snowstorms, and big cities. The news of the visit was a welcome distraction for Don, who had recently found a puppy and was relieved that no one had come to claim it, and the puppy was eventually named Rob.
