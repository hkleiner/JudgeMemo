        "section_summary": "Jean Fran√ßois Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is a direct descendant of the Dutch masters, particularly Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" capture the simplicity and struggles of rural life with incisive truth and sincerity. His art is characterized by subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his simple and earnest life, as well as his appreciation for the works of Andrea Mantegna. Despite some criticism of sentimentality, Millet's work is considered great and enduring art, conveying a message about the human struggle and the importance of religion in peasant life. Overall, Millet's unique style and approach to painting have secured his place as a master of peasant life depiction."

        "section_summary": "Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in \"La Baigneuse,\" his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and solitude of peasant life, as seen in works like \"The Sheep Pen,\" which conveys the loneliness and hardship of rural labor. His art reflects his philosophical nature, and he is more accurately described as a philosopher than a painter. Through his work, Millet revealed a profound understanding of the human experience, particularly the simple, everyday struggles of the common people."
