        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare and Milton demonstrates a natural affinity for literature, despite his lack of formal education. The author concludes that a true bookman can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless classics, and values the latter for their enduring literary merit."

        "section_summary": "The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact. A true classic, according to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, is a book that enriches the human mind, speaks to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcends the limitations of a single age. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author, a self-proclaimed bookman, values these classic works and believes they should be distinguished from more ordinary books that may only be relevant for a short time. The subject matter of a book is not as important as its literary quality, and a bookman should be open to works from various perspectives and styles."
