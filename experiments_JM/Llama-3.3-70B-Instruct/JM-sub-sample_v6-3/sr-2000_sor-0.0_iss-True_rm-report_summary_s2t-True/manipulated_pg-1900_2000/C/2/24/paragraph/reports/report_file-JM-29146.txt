Section section_01 (Chars 0–8145):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all outworld ships and stranding their pilots. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworld pilots and passengers stranded on Irwadi, and it's unclear how they will manage to survive until a resolution is found.
