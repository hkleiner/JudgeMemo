Section section_01 (Chars 0–8216):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a permit, known as a carnet rouge, which allowed her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She was initially offered permission to visit Rouen and Meaux, but she refused and asked to visit other areas, including Bar-le-Duc and Verdun. The author eventually visited Meaux, where she saw the impressive and somber sights of the battlefield of the Marne, including fields of graves marked with flags and crosses.

Section section_02 (Chars 8217–11464):
Section Summary: The village of Barcy was heavily damaged during the war, with the church and several houses reduced to ruins. The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, enduring constant shelling. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was assisted by a polite official who provided them with helpful information and a letter of introduction. The narrator set out on the trip alone, observing many healthy and contented soldiers at the train station and on the journey. They were struck by the height and confidence of the French officers they met during the two-hour train ride to Châlons.
