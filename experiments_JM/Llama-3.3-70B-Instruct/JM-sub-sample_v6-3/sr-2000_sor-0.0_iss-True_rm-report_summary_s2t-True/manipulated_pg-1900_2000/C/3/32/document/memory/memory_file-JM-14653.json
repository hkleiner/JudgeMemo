        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, filled with secrets, gifts, and feasting, but now it has become a time of gluttony, expensiveness, and forced enjoyment. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in the way people experience Christmas. Children still embody the true spirit of Christmas, with their faith and enthusiasm, but adults have lost some of this passion and sincerity. The author argues that acknowledging this change is necessary to understand and address the issue, rather than simply denying or ignoring it."

        "section_summary": "The old Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sparked an age of doubt and skepticism. This era of questioning led people to abandon not only outdated facts but also faith and principles, resulting in a loss of enthusiasm and sentiment. However, despite the changes brought about by science and philosophy, fundamental spiritual and moral principles remain intact, and humanity still needs to live with dignity and mutual goodwill. Deep down, people know that the true essence of Christmas remains, which is why they strive to keep the Christmas spirit alive in themselves and their children. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit is essential to humanity, and its loss would leave people feeling lost and without direction."
