Her father, a drunkard, has joined a group of men heading to Boston to fight, and Debby is forced to stay behind with Mrs. Lane, a strict and severe woman. Debby is heartbroken and desperate to be with her father, and she even considers joining him as a drummer boy. She is eventually taken in by Mrs. Lane, but she is miserable and longs for her father and her drum, which she had to hide away. As time passes, Debby grows stronger and learns new skills, but her heart remains hard and bitter due to her separation from her father."

        "section_summary": "The passage begins with a quote from Tocqueville about the potential dangers of democracy, but quickly shifts to the story of Debby, a young girl who has had a difficult life with her father. Debby's mother had encouraged her to be a lady and stay with her father, but after her mother's passing, Debby's life became one of neglect and misery. Debby is now living with Mrs. Lane, who tries to discipline and moralize her, but Debby resists and is drawn to a friend named Jack Martin, whom Mrs. Lane disapproves of. As Debby sits in her room, reflecting on her life and her desire to be decent and respectable, she thinks about her father and wonders if he may have been involved in the battles against King George. Debby's thoughts are interrupted by the sound of Mrs. Lane's evening devotions, and she knows that she will soon face punishment for her disobedience."
