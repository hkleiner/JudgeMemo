Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and eventually rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of this historic site.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–16859):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it remains a significant ecclesiastical center to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and captured by the Danes, who killed many Saxons, including Archbishop Alphege, and burnt the cathedral.

Section section_03 (Chars 16860–25078):
Section Summary: The body of Archbishop Alphege was brought back to Canterbury from London by King Canute, who made amends for the devastation caused by his people. The Saxon cathedral was later destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in the Norman style by Archbishop Lanfranc. The new cathedral was further modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Thomas Becket, who was killed by four knights on December 29. The events leading up to Becket's murder, including his return from exile and his confrontation with the four knights, are a pivotal part of Canterbury's history.

Section section_04 (Chars 25079–33275):
Section Summary: Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered by four knights in the cathedral after a heated argument. Despite being aware of the danger, Becket refused to take any measures to ensure his safety, and the knights ultimately killed him with several sword strokes. After his death, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, with the discovery of his hair-cloth shirt and the presence of vermin on his body being seen as evidence of his austerity and devotion. The news of his martyrdom sparked a wave of pilgrims to Canterbury, and his relics were highly sought after for their perceived healing properties. King Henry II, who had been implicated in Becket's death, later performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and shedding tears at Becket's tomb.

Section section_05 (Chars 33276–42065):
Section Summary: After King Henry II's penance for the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, the Cathedral of Canterbury became a major pilgrimage site, attracting vast crowds and wealth. A fire in 1174 damaged the cathedral, and it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, which combined Romanesque and Gothic elements. The shrine of Becket was completed in 1220, and its translation was a grand ceremony attended by Henry III and many ecclesiastical dignitaries. Over the centuries, the cathedral underwent further changes, including the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style, and it remained a major center of the English Church. Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of Becket's shrine, Canterbury continued to thrive as a city and a center of ecclesiastical authority.

Section section_06 (Chars 42066–50387):
Section Summary: The city's medieval architecture is on full display as one approaches the West Gate and enters St. Peter's Street, lined with old houses and shops. A narrow turning, Mercery Lane, offers a glimpse of the Cathedral's western towers, drawing the visitor in with its romantic charm. The Cathedral's precincts are filled with historic buildings, including the remains of the infirmary, the treasury, and the prior's lodging, showcasing a mix of Norman and Perpendicular styles. The Green Court, a grassy space surrounded by trees, frames a perfect view of the Angel Steeple and the surrounding buildings, creating an uplifting atmosphere. The Cathedral's exterior, with its intricate architecture and historic significance, sets the stage for a breathtaking interior experience.

Section section_07 (Chars 50388–58854):
Section Summary: The Cathedral's vast nave, with its cool, greenish light, is a magnificent vestibule to the rest of the building, and its emptiness is a stark contrast to the vibrant colors and ornaments that once filled the space. The building's architecture, including the supporting arch and the western screen, showcases the skill and simplicity of its design. The Cathedral is home to numerous monuments and tombs, including those of notable figures such as Dean Farrar, Orlando Gibbons, and the Black Prince, whose tomb is a magnificent piece of work with intricate details. The Trinity Chapel, where the shrine of St. Thomas once stood, is now an empty space, but the site still holds significant historical and cultural importance. The chapel is also the final resting place of King Henry IV and his wife, Joan of Navarre, and features a beautiful thirteenth-century mosaic pavement.

Section section_08 (Chars 58854–67491):
Section Summary: The eastern extension of the Canterbury Cathedral chapel, known as Becket's Crown, contains a chair made of Purbeck marble where Archbishops are enthroned. The Trinity Chapel features a remarkable series of 13th-century stained glass windows that depict the miracles of St. Thomas, which are some of the finest examples of their kind in England. The city of Canterbury still retains much of its medieval charm, with its old walls and narrow streets, despite the destruction of many of its historic gates and buildings over the years. The city's West Gate is one of the few remaining gates, and it was nearly demolished in the 19th century to make way for a circus procession. The nearby St. Augustine's Abbey, founded by Augustine in the 6th century, has been restored and now serves as a missionary college, preserving its historic significance and association with the early days of Christianity in England.

Section section_09 (Chars 67491–69152):
Section Summary: Canterbury has more to offer beyond its famous Cathedral, Abbey, and St. Martin's Church. The city is home to other historical sites, including the Castle, old inns, and examples of early domestic architecture. The remains of lesser-known religious houses, hospitals, and churches, such as the Black Friars and Grey Friars, can also be found. Several hospitals, including St. John the Baptist and Eastbridge Hospital, are located within the city, while the old Hospital of St. Nicholas, a former leper hospital, is situated outside the city. The city's churches, with the exception of All Saints' in High Street, are also worth visiting, with St. Dunstan's being a notable example due to its connection to Sir Thomas More.
