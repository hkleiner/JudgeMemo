Spencer's idea that progress is the evolution of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations resonated with the author. The author believes that Spencer's first essay contains the germ of his best teachings and that his method was most effectively employed in interpreting biological phenomena. Spencer's work had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, with experts like Charles Darwin and William James praising his original thought. Overall, Spencer's philosophy emphasized the importance of biological relationships and the universal law of differentiation, which he believed was the driving force behind progress."

He believed that everything, including social and political developments, could be explained by the gradual growth of things through natural processes. Spencer's philosophy is also characterized by his concept of the Unknowable, or the Ultimate Reality, which is the source of all existence and evolution. However, this concept is ambiguous and has been criticized for its vagueness, as Spencer uses terms like \"force\" and \"cause\" in multiple senses. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy aims to provide a unified explanation of all phenomena, but its emphasis on the Unknowable sets it apart from scientific inquiry, which limits its scope to observable phenomena."

Spencer's concept of the \"Unknowable\" refers to the ultimate power that drives all phenomena, which is beyond human understanding. Bergson, on the other hand, proposes the idea of \"Life\" as the source of evolution, which is also unknowable by the intellect. Both thinkers agree that the intellect can only provide a world of symbols, and that the true nature of reality can only be known through intuition. The section also touches on Spencer's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, and the notion of power that works changes in the world."

In science, the concept of cause can be replaced by the idea of relatedness and change, where the co-presence of things in a certain relationship implies certain motions and changes. The concept of energy is also reevaluated, with some arguing that it is not an active agent that produces change, but rather a constant ratio of variables that describes the changes themselves. The author suggests that the word \"Source\" be used instead of \"cause\" to avoid ambiguity, and that the term \"force\" be understood as a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness. Ultimately, the author argues that the concept of cause and conditions should be reexamined, and that the distinction between them is not always clear-cut."

There are different types of relatedness, including physico-chemical, vital, and cognitive, each with its own unique properties and characteristics. As systems evolve, new properties and relationships emerge that cannot be predicted from the component parts alone, a concept known as \"emergent properties.\" This idea challenges the traditional view of evolution as simply a combination of existing elements, and instead suggests that new and complex relationships give rise to new properties and phenomena. The author proposes a hierarchical structure of relatedness, where cognitive relationships imply vital relationships, which in turn imply physico-chemical relationships, providing a framework for understanding the evolution of complex systems."

Spencer's view of cognition emphasizes the complex relationship between the organism and its environment, but his terminology can be perplexing, and his analysis of cognitive relatedness is not entirely adequate. A scientific interpretation of cognition should deal with it as a constitutive mode of relatedness in the realm of nature, without relying on unscientific concepts like psychic entities or entelechies.

        "section_summary": "The author discusses the relationship between cognition and physiological processes, arguing that cognition implies certain underlying physiological changes, but rejecting the idea of parallelism or separate orders of being. Instead, the author suggests that cognitive processes should be understood as correlated with physiological processes, similar to how physiological processes are correlated with physico-chemical processes. The author also critiques the concept of identity hypothesis, which posits that mind and nervous action are two faces of the same thing, and instead advocates for a more modest hypothesis that cognition always implies certain physiological processes. The author emphasizes that cognitive relatedness is effective, meaning that it can bring about changes in the system, and that it is not merely an epiphenomenal accompaniment to physical processes. Ultimately, the author argues that a scientific approach to cognition should treat it as a type of relatedness within the natural order, similar to other types of relatedness."

Their thoughts and ideas are like children that they should nurture and protect. A wise person will not take their beliefs lightly and will express the truth as they see it. They will do so fearlessly, knowing it is their responsibility to contribute to the world in a meaningful way. By speaking the truth, they are fulfilling their duty and playing their part in the world."
