Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and efforts allowed the Allies to prepare and launch successful operations, including the defense of France and Italy. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but Russia's participation and sacrifices helped to prevent this outcome. Overall, Russia's role in the war was crucial, and its contributions should not be underestimated, despite its eventual collapse in 1917."

This self-sacrificing move by Russia played a crucial role in the outcome of the war, as it prevented Germany from winning a decisive victory over France. General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to distort this fact, falsely claiming that he defeated a large Russian force with a small German army, but his own admission reveals that the transfer of troops to East Prussia had fatal consequences for Germany. Russia's early efforts in the war, although costly, helped to shift the balance of power in favor of the Allies. Ultimately, Russia's sacrifices in the war were instrumental in preventing a German victory, and their importance should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts."

The Russian Army's operations in East Prussia, Galicia, and Poland forced Germany to transfer 300,000 soldiers to the Eastern front, abandoning their offensive in France. This led to a significant shift in Germany's strategy, with Ludendorff himself acknowledging that the German front in the West was weakened, and they were compelled to focus on the Eastern front. As a result, Germany was unable to launch a major offensive in France for over a year, giving the Allies a significant advantage. Russia's sacrifices and efforts during this period were instrumental in shaping the course of the war, and their contributions should not be underestimated."

Despite this, the Russians were able to divert German attention and resources away from the Western front, giving the Allies a crucial year to prepare and recover. The German army was forced to maintain a large presence on the Eastern front, with 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions, which limited their ability to launch a decisive attack on the Western front. The Russian resistance in 1915 prevented the Germans from achieving a major breakthrough, and their efforts were further hindered by the lack of reserves, which were being constantly depleted by the Russian front. This ultimately contributed to the failure of the German offensive at Verdun in 1916, as they were unable to follow up their initial successes due to a lack of reserves."

The Russian army's offensive in 1916, led by General Brusilov, was a significant turning point, capturing hundreds of thousands of prisoners and forcing the Austrians to abandon their offensive in Italy. This, in turn, allowed the Italians to launch a counter-offensive and relieved pressure on the French front, enabling the Allies to launch a successful offensive at the Somme. Russia continued to provide crucial assistance to its allies, including during the Verdun period and in the salvation of Romania from invasion by Mackensen and Falkenhayn. The Russian army's efforts, despite its own weaknesses and lack of supplies, played a significant role in supporting its allies and ultimately contributing to Germany's defeat."
