Section section_01 (Chars 0–8188):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. As they traveled, they encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs, also known as "yellow barbarians" by the Chinese, claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago. The village has a small temple, where seven or eight lamas live and earn a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history, legends, or songs with the expedition.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and use Chinese household utensils. Their clothing is a mix of Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men wearing long coats and fur hats, and women wearing distinctive head dresses adorned with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and tea made with salt and butter. They appear to be living in straitened circumstances, with limited economic resources and a lack of energy and manliness, particularly among the young men. Overall, their way of life is simple and traditional, with limited exposure to external influences and a strong emphasis on their cultural heritage.

Section section_03 (Chars 16505–24382):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögurs are a primitive tribe with distinct physical characteristics, such as a turned-up nose and small eyes, and they have a simple and traditional way of life. Their customs and practices are influenced by their Buddhist beliefs, with lamas playing a significant role in important life events like births, deaths, and weddings. The tribe has a patriarchal society, with property inherited by the wife, but daughters having no rights, and marriage is typically arranged by parents without consulting the young people. The Sarö Yögurs have a limited understanding of medicine, relying on lamas to pray for the sick, and their social gatherings are mostly limited to weddings and occasional visits. The tribe's population has been declining due to unfavorable living conditions, with deaths outnumbering births in recent years.

Section section_04 (Chars 24382–32480):
Section Summary: The author bid farewell to their host and began a journey to the village of Yench'i, accompanied by their men and two packhorses. Along the way, they observed the poor soil and coarse grass, as well as thin and small cows, and noted the lack of energy and manliness among the local Turkish tribe, the Shera Yögurs. The author then traveled to Kanchow, where they obtained a letter of introduction to the Tangutan Prince and prepared for a visit to the "Yellow Tanguts" living to the south. With a small group of followers, the author set out on a winter morning, navigating a challenging terrain of frozen rivers, steep slopes, and rocky ravines. They eventually passed through a guardhouse and continued on their journey, catching sight of a Buddhist tower in the distance.

Section section_05 (Chars 32481–40609):
Section Summary: The author arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, and was struck by its large, massive temple with gilded Buddha roof-decorations. The monastery's buildings were made of timber, with small, dark rooms and simple furnishings, and the temple itself was decorated with Buddhist pictures and banners. The author noted that the lamas living in the monastery were friendly, but few in number, and that the gegen, or Great Lama, was still a child living in the mountains. The lamas were supported by voluntary contributions and played an important role in the community, performing services such as prayer-reading and fortune-telling. The author ultimately left the monastery on December 29th, after being unable to persuade the lamas to participate in anthropological measurements, and departed with a more favorable impression of the surrounding countryside.

Section Summary: The author describes their journey through a mountainous region, passing by the Kiito-gol and Hrar-gol rivers, and visiting the monastery of K'anglungssu. They meet with the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs, and learn about the tribe's governance, laws, and traditions. The Shera Yögurs inhabit the surrounding mountains and are governed by a system of t'umus, with the ta t'umu being the highest authority. The author also learns about the tribe's history, including their migration to the area during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi, although the exact details are unclear due to a lack of documentation. The t'umu shares concerns about the Chinese authorities' treatment of the tribe, including arbitrary taxation and extortion.

Section section_07 (Chars 48427–55967):
Section Summary: The Yögurs, a Mongolian tribe, believe they share a common ancestry with the Sarö Yögurs, despite linguistic differences. The Chinese government had previously exterminated a tribe called the Hung maotzu, and the Yögurs were sent to inhabit the desolate land, where they were provided with cattle. The tribe has since dwindled in numbers due to death and assimilation with the Chinese, with women outnumbering men and many families having few children. The Yögurs have a unique system of "bones" or clans, which determines relationships and marriage eligibility, and they follow traditional customs such as sky burial and arranged marriages. The tribe is led by a nominal head, the Ta t'umu, but his authority is limited, and the settlement of taxes is not under his control.

Section Summary: The Shera Yögurs have a unique wedding procession and ceremony, where the bride and groom are treated to food, tea, and festivities, and the bridegroom receives a dowry. After marriage, the couple visits the bride's parents, and gifts are exchanged. The Shera Yögurs have distinct physical characteristics, such as medium height, well-formed hands and feet, and black or dark hair, and they are known for their intelligence, liveliness, and fondness for jokes. Their traditional costume consists of a sheepskin coat, scarf, and trousers, with women wearing a distinctive head-dress and ornaments. The Shera Yögurs also have a simple and practical way of life, with domestic appliances and implements being mostly Chinese, and a limited home industry that includes weaving and joinery.

Section section_09 (Chars 64473–72672):
Section Summary: The Yögur people live in uncomfortable tents, but despite their difficult living conditions, they maintain a relatively clean and tidy lifestyle. Their diet consists of traditional nomadic foods such as tea, roasted flour, and meat, which they eat with Chinese chopsticks or their fingers. The Yögurs are a peaceful and content people, with no evidence of quarreling or dissatisfaction, and they spend their evenings singing, praying, and socializing around the fire. Their livestock, including yaks, sheep, and horses, appear to be of good quality, but the Yögurs have not fully recovered from the losses they suffered during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs do not seem to engage in sports or hunting, and their only notable activity is target practice with rifles, which they obtain from Sinin.
