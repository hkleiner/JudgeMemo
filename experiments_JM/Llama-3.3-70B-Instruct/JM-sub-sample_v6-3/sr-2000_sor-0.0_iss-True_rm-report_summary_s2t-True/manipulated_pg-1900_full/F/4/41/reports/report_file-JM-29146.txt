Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is among those grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot's license. With no ship to pilot, Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved, and he visits his friend Stu Englander, a fellow pilot who is also struggling financially. Englander is desperate and considers looking for a job in the New Quarter, but Ramsey offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the vital metal titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–15935):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive. The encounter leaves Ramsey feeling uneasy, and he wonders about the reason behind Symm's appointment as Security Chief. The situation highlights the tensions between Earthmen and the native Irwadians, who resent the influence of outworlders on their planet.

Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an administrator, intervenes when Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, mistreats a Vegan girl, Mith Vegan, in a gambling hall. Ramsey hits Symm and escapes with the girl, taking her to his room in the Old Quarter to gather his belongings before they go into hiding. However, upon arriving at his room, he finds an Earthgirl waiting for him, who claims to be a telepath and has taken possession of his m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is provocatively dressed and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, leaving him unsure of her intentions. Ramsey is forced to bring the Vegan girl into the room, and the Earthgirl's presence creates an awkward and uncertain situation.

Section Summary: Ramsey is in a situation where a woman, Margot Dennison, thinks he can help her escape from Irwadi. She offers to pay him to take her through hyper-space to Centauri, and he agrees, but only if a Vegan girl who is with him can come too. After they arrive at Margot's apartment, she disappears, leaving Ramsey and the Vegan girl locked in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter that suggests Margot is searching for something related to an ancient hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth. The letter hints that this pattern may be connected to the origins of humanity, and Margot is determined to uncover more information.

Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, and a Vegan girl named Vardin to escape from Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security. They work on repairing a old spaceship in a junkyard, planning to escape and potentially uncover the secrets of proto-man. As they work, Margot reveals that she is a mind reader and senses that they are being watched, adding an air of mystery and danger to their situation.

Section section_06 (Chars 39697–47571):
Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are trying to escape from the planet Irwadi, but they are being followed by Security Officer Ramar Chind and his boss Garr Symm. Garr Symm, a scientist, has discovered a valuable letter in Margot's apartment and wants to let them escape so he can follow them and uncover more information. Chind is instructed to load a wrecked ship with the fuel they need, U-235 slow-implosion capsules, to aid in their escape. Meanwhile, Vardin uses a scintillation counter to find the fuel they need, and Margot retrieves it from a wrecked ship. Garr Symm's ultimate goal is to use the information to make Irwadi the dominant planet in the galaxy, with him as the absolute dictator.

Section Summary: The Enterprise is preparing to embark on a journey through hyper-space in search of a valuable find. Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin are on board, with Margot trying to uncover Ramsey's secret, known as "X", which is related to proto-man, a pre-human ancestor of all humanoid races. As they enter hyper-space, they experience weightlessness and a lack of time, which is a unique property of this realm. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and Ramar Chind are tracking the Enterprise from their ship, the Dog Star, using radar that behaves perfectly in hyper-space due to the absence of time. The Enterprise encounters eddies in hyper-space, which are unpredictable and must be navigated carefully to avoid problems.

Section section_08 (Chars 55919–63895):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison takes control of the Enterprise, forcing Ramsey to land on a mysterious world in hyper-space. Despite the ship's readings indicating a lethal environment with extreme cold and no atmosphere, Margot is determined to explore the planet, which she believes is the home of proto-man. Ramsey has a realization that the absence of time in hyper-space could protect them from the harsh conditions, and Margot forces him to reveal this thought. With the m.g. gun, Margot threatens to harm Vardin if Ramsey doesn't comply with her demands, and she decides to take Vardin with her to explore the planet. Garr Symm, who is tracking the Enterprise, decides to follow them down to the planet, despite feeling a deep-seated fear that may be linked to ancestral memories.

Section section_09 (Chars 63896–72019):
Section Summary: Margot and Ramsey are on a timeless world where time has no meaning, and they discover that lethal weapons like the m.g. gun are ineffective. They hear a beautiful, otherworldly music, which Vardin identifies as the "Music of the Spheres," a legend from her home planet of Vega III. As the fog surrounding them begins to lift, a black rectangular object, a matter-transmitter, appears, and Margot is drawn to it, realizing its potential to control the galaxy. Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with a being known as proto-man, and he tries to stop her from reaching the transmitter. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and his men arrive, attempting to stop Margot and claim the transmitter for themselves, leading to a confrontation with Ramsey.

Section section_10 (Chars 72020–77487):
Section Summary: Ramsey fought off the Irwadi space-suited figures, who died after their helmets were damaged, apparently due to mental suggestion. Vardin, a Proto-man, revealed that his people had discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Garr Symm, who had used the matter-transmission device, emerged with the face of his caveman ancestors, illustrating the devastating consequences of the technology. Vardin, a guardian, had been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this power, and with his mission accomplished, he disappeared. Ramsey and Margot, who had developed feelings for each other, left the planet and blasted off into space, ready to start a new life together.
