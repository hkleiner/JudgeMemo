In contrast, children still experience the thrill and wonder of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what keeps the spirit of the holiday alive. The author argues that this decline in enthusiasm is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine change in the way Christmas is perceived and celebrated. The institution of Christmas was not created by adults for the benefit of children, but rather was once a deeply meaningful and enjoyable holiday for adults as well. The author suggests that understanding and confronting the reasons for this decline is necessary to revitalize the true spirit of Christmas."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been diminished in the hearts of adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sparked an age of doubt and skepticism. This era of skepticism has led people to abandon faith and principles, seeking only facts and dismissing sentiment and enthusiasm. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, including faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are essential for human dignity and existence. The Christmas feast was fixed on December 25 to coincide with the winter solstice, a pre-Christian festival celebrating the triumph of light over darkness, which symbolizes hope and renewal. Ultimately, the author suggests that despite the changes in human understanding and knowledge, the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underlies Christmas will endure."

Despite differences, mankind is a fellowship of brothers, and the idea of social justice, which means putting goodwill into practice, is a flourishing faith. The concept of universal goodwill is alive and well, inspiring many people, including literary artists, to work towards a better world. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster faith in goodwill, providing a concrete symbol of an intangible idea. Christmas, with its traditions and spirit of peace and goodwill, is a particularly apt festival to promote this faith, and its customs, such as gift-giving and good-wishing, can be powerful expressions of sympathy and brotherhood when done with sincerity and imagination."

Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those closest to them, such as family members or colleagues. The key to cultivating goodwill is to use one's imagination to understand and sympathize with others, putting oneself in their shoes and sharing their feelings and experiences. This requires effort and a willingness to set aside one's own biases and prejudices, but it can lead to genuine connections and a deeper sense of understanding. By cultivating goodwill in this way, individuals can create a positive impact on those around them, without needing to advertise their intentions or seek external validation."

By doing so, one can overcome their own egotism and develop a deeper understanding of others, leading to more meaningful relationships and a greater sense of connection. As a result, one's interactions with others become more genuine and heartfelt, and even traditional celebrations like Christmas take on a new significance as a time to appreciate and nurture friendships. Ultimately, the systematic cultivation of goodwill can lead to a more profound appreciation for the value of companionship and mutual understanding in making life's journey more enjoyable and meaningful."

Despite this, humans have an inherent instinct to strive and make New Year's resolutions, which are often driven by a desire to improve and attain an ideal, even if it is unattainable.
