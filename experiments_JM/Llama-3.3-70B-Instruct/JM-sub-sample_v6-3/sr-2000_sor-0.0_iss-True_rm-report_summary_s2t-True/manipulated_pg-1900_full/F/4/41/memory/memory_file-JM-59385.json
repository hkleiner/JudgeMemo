This opportunity brought her great joy, as she envisioned a better future for her people, with improved transportation relieving the burdens of manual labor. The narrator spent time with Chia Kuei Ping in her home, learning about her life and family, and was impressed by her wisdom and eagerness to share her knowledge. Chia Kuei Ping's home was nestled in a village surrounded by ancient temples and trees, where she had also established a school and church, which was filled with children eager to learn. The parents in the village sought a better life for their children, inspired by the positive changes they saw in Chia Kuei Ping."
