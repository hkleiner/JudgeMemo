The author shares two contrasting examples of young men who entered the teaching profession, one who viewed it as just a job and another who was passionate and dedicated to making it a profession. The latter example demonstrates a teacher who took initiative to improve the school environment and address student needs, ultimately leading to success and advancement in their career. In contrast, the former example shows a lack of interest and investment in the profession, resulting in a negative impact on the school. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, and notes that a pleasing and forceful personality is a key factor in inspiring and educating students."

To be considered for a position, teachers should be careful when filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A superintendent is more likely to understand a teacher's motives for applying elsewhere if they have been interviewed and are willing to assist them in professional development. Before starting a new position, it's essential to get acquainted with the school situation, meet with the board and community, and prepare for the upcoming school year. By doing so, a superintendent can enter their new role with minimal friction and make informed decisions to benefit the school and its students."

With the rapid growth of high school enrollment, schools face the challenge of providing courses that cater to diverse student abilities and prepare them for various vocations. To address this, schools have introduced vocational guidance departments, trade schools, and part-time schools to help students adjust to proper vocations. By studying local industrial and commercial conditions, schools can offer relevant special subjects and encourage students to learn about different vocations. Ultimately, the goal is to provide each student with a chance to adjust to a vocation, and schools are making efforts to achieve this through various means, including vocational guidance and classification of pupils according to ability."
