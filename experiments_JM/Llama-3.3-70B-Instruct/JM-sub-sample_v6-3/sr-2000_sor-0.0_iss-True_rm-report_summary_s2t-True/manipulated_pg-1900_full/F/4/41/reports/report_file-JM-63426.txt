Section section_05 (Chars 33148–41781):
Section Summary: During the Victorian period, typography had declined, with typefounders producing novelty faces and compositors mixing multiple typefaces. However, the author, Will Bradley, developed a love for traditional Caslon typefaces after visiting the Boston Public Library and accessing the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience inspired him to establish the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1895, where he printed materials using Caslon typefaces, which initially received criticism from printers but eventually gained popularity. The Wayside Press was part of a larger aesthetic awakening in the field of publishing, with other presses and designers also producing high-quality, artistic works. Bradley's press was named for its location, which he saw as a temporary stop on his way to becoming an artist, and its device was a dandelion leaf, symbolizing a wayside growth.
