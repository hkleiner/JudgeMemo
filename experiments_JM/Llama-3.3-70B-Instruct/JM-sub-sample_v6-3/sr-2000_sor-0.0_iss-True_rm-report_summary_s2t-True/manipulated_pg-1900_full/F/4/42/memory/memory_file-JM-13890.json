        "section_summary": "In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who had been dead for 368 years, to appear before him, resulting in the destruction of Becket's shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine continued to attract pilgrims, and in the 20th century, a new enthusiasm for the Pilgrims' Way from Winchester to Canterbury emerged. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, which meant the city of the men of Kent. Today, pilgrims can still follow the old Pilgrims' Way to Canterbury, although many now use the railway, missing out on the scenic views and historic landmarks along the way."

In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, despite facing challenges such as the Danish invasion in 1011, which destroyed the cathedral and killed many Saxons. The city was eventually rebuilt, and the cathedral was restored, with Canterbury continuing to be an important center of Christianity in England."

The new cathedral, completed in 1077, was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, who had returned from exile just a few days prior. The murder was carried out by four knights who had been sent by King Henry II, and it led to Canterbury becoming a major pilgrimage site in Europe. The events surrounding Becket's murder were marked by a dramatic and tense confrontation between the archbishop and the four knights, which ultimately ended in tragedy."

Despite being aware of the danger, Becket refused to take measures to ensure his safety, and the knights killed him with multiple sword strokes. Becket's body was found to have a hair-cloth shirt and other signs of austerity, which led the monks to declare him a saint, and soon his relics became highly valued for their supposed healing properties. King Henry, who had inadvertently caused Becket's death, performed a severe penance at Canterbury, including walking barefoot and receiving strokes with a monastic rod, to atone for his actions. This event marked the beginning of Canterbury's reputation as a major pilgrimage site, with thousands of pilgrims flocking to the city to visit Becket's tomb and seek healing."
