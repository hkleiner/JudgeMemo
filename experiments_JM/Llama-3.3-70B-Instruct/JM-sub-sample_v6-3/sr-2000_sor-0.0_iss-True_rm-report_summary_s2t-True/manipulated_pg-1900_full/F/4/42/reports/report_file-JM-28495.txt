Section section_01 (Chars 0–8249):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are thwarted, including a humorous encounter with a mischievous street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and comical.

Section section_02 (Chars 8250–16444):
Section Summary: Stella and the narrator attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but their pursuit ended in failure when the man escaped into his home. Exhausted and discomfited, they returned home, and Stella suggested that they should have considered the possibility that the man was coming from the Dogs' Home, not going to it. The next day, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grew up, he became a large, lumbering dog with a unique appearance and a humble but determined personality.

Section section_03 (Chars 16445–24728):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but dim-witted companion. Despite being told to go home, Excalibur insists on following the narrator, and his persistence eventually earns him a scolding. Excalibur is a gentle giant, fond of children and babies, and is often the subject of playful games and activities. He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then forgets where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often cause embarrassment, as when he hides a bone in a cushion at a dinner party, but his affectionate nature makes him a beloved member of the family.

Section section_04 (Chars 24729–32968):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various shopkeepers and animals. Eileen had attempted to teach Excalibur tricks, but he was not very successful and often caused more chaos than harmony. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, and made a mess, but Eileen's charm and apology helped to break the ice and introduce her to the curate. As Eileen and the curate spent more time together, Excalibur became a frequent chaperone, and his presence was tolerated despite the chaos he often caused, such as on the tennis lawn where Eileen and the curate would play. Excalibur's laid-back nature made him a patient and forgiving companion, even in the midst of noisy and chaotic situations.

Section section_05 (Chars 32968–41042):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a gentle creature, often found himself in awkward situations while accompanying Eileen and the curate on their outings, including a game of golf where he was struck by balls and a country walk where he encountered a hare. Meanwhile, Eileen and the curate were preoccupied with their own concerns, discussing the curate's limited financial prospects and the challenges of living on a small income. The curate felt that he couldn't provide for Eileen on his own and decided that he needed to leave for London to find work and build a better future for them. Despite their concerns, the pair put on a brave face and decided not to share their plans with others. Excalibur, oblivious to their troubles, continued to enjoy his time with Eileen, even if it meant enduring boring and exhausting activities like golf.

Section Summary: A tramp approached a group in a yard and asked for money, claiming he hadn't eaten or drunk anything since the previous day. The lady, Eileen, told him to go to the Church Hall to find the rector, who could help him, but the tramp refused to leave unless given money. Eileen then went into the house and returned with a large dog, Excalibur, which she pretended was about to attack the tramp, telling him to run. The tramp quickly fled, and once he was gone, Eileen let go of the dog's collar and it fell asleep. The tramp's departure brought relief to the group, and order was restored to the yard.
