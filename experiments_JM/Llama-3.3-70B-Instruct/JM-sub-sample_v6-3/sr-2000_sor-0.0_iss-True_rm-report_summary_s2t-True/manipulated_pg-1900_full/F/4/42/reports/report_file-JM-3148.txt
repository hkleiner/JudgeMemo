Section section_01 (Chars 0–8002):
Section Summary: The story begins with a boy named Davy reading to his uncle, Anthony Croft, who is blind. Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his instrument. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he recalls his own childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in the outdoors and in music. Anthony's love for music was evident even as a young boy, when he would create makeshift instruments and hide a precious tuning fork outside the school window to avoid having it confiscated. The scene ends with Anthony playing his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony and beauty.

Section section_02 (Chars 8002–16046):
Section Summary: Tony Croft, a curious and inquisitive boy, was often considered lazy by the villagers because he didn't conform to traditional learning methods. However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. Tony's passion for learning and discovery led him to develop a keen interest in music and instrument-making, and he spent hours taking apart and reassembling instruments to understand how they worked. As he grew older, Tony's skills improved, and he began to earn a little money by repairing instruments for the villagers, although they often undervalued his work. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother tolerated his eccentricities, even if she didn't fully understand them.

Section section_03 (Chars 16046–24363):
Section Summary: The village where Anthony Croft lived disapproved of his love for the violin, with some people associating it with dancing and dissipation. Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins. At the age of 17, he discovered a precious piece of wood from a historic maple tree, which he set aside to use for making a perfect violin in the future. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. As Anthony delved deeper into his craft, he became inspired by the poetry of Emerson and the legacy of Antonio Stradivari, striving to create perfect violins that would bring beauty and music to the world.

Section Summary: Aunt Hitty was determined to make Old Mrs. Butterfield's funeral a success, and it was indeed considered a success by the villagers, with even an undertaker from Saco praising Aunt Hitty's skills. After the funeral, Lyddy Ann Butterfield inherited her aunt's property, a small house on the river, and moved in, enjoying the solitude and quiet of the place. Lyddy had a troubled past, having been disfigured in a childhood accident and subsequently kept out of sight by her mother, leading to a life of solitude and introversion. As a result, she had few visitors in her first month in Edgewood, and the community was still getting used to her presence. Aunt Hitty, however, was already disapproving of Lyddy's actions, particularly her decision to remove the silver coffin-plates that her aunt had displayed.
