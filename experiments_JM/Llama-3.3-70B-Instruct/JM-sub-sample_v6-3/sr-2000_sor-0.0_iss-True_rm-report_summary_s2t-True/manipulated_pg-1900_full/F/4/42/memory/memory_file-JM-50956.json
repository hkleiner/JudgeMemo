Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy and made it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat them. Russia's contributions were crucial in saving Italy, facilitating the operations of the Allies on the Somme, and defending against German and Austrian armies. If Russia had not made these sacrifices, Germany may have won the war, as it had a significant advantage in numbers and military skill during the initial months of the conflict. Overall, Russia's role in the war was instrumental in preventing a German victory and ultimately contributing to the Allied success."

By advancing into East Prussia, Russia diverted German troops from the French front, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory in the First Battle of the Marne. German General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to distort this fact, falsely claiming that he defeated a large Russian force with a small German army, but his own admission acknowledges the strategic catastrophe that resulted from Russia's invasion. Russia's self-sacrifice and efforts during the war were significant, but have been obscured by later events and misinformation. The Russian Army's actions in the early days of the war were instrumental in preventing Germany's victory, and their contributions should be recognized as a crucial part of the Allied effort."

In October and November 1914, Russia's military operations in Galicia, Poland, and East Prussia forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers from France to the Eastern front, ultimately leading to the abandonment of their offensive in France for over a year. The Russian Army's efforts compelled the Germans to adopt a defensive strategy in the West and focus on the Eastern front, which played a decisive role in the war. Russia's contributions were crucial in preventing the Germans from breaking through to Calais and in delaying their attempts to crush France. The Russian Army's sacrifices and bravery, despite being underprepared and underequipped, were instrumental in shaping the course of the war."

Despite this, the Russian Army played a crucial role in diverting German forces and resources away from the Western front, allowing the Allies to prepare and accumulate new reserves. The Russian front tied up significant German forces, with 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions deployed against Russia in May 1917, compared to only 142 divisions on the Anglo-French front. This diversion of German resources gave the Allies a significant advantage, allowing them to recover from early losses and prepare for future offensives. The Russian Army's efforts, particularly in 1915, ultimately contributed to the German military catastrophe and the outcome of the war."

In 1916, Russia launched a crucial offensive, led by General Brusilov, which helped alleviate pressure on Italy and forced Austria to abandon its offensive. This offensive also had a significant impact on the French front, allowing the Allies to launch a successful counterattack at the Somme. Russia continued to provide critical assistance to its allies, including helping to defend Romania from invasion in late 1916. Despite being weakened by revolution and conspiracy in 1917, Russia still managed to tie up significant enemy forces on the Eastern front, limiting their ability to deploy troops to other fronts."
