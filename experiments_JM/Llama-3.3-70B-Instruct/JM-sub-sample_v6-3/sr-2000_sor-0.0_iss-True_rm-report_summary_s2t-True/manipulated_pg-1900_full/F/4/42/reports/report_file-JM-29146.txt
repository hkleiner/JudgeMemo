Section section_01 (Chars 0–8030):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists that he can pay him back when he gets a chance. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8031–15997):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations behind it. The situation is tense, with underlying resentment towards Earth and its influence in the galaxy.

Section section_03 (Chars 15998–23560):
Section Summary: Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, is a drunkard who is grossly incompetent, yet he holds a top security job. Ramsey intervenes when Symm is hurting a Vegan girl, Mith, and after a confrontation, they escape together. Ramsey takes Mith to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she's letting on, and she's amused by the situation, particularly the Vegan girl's mistaken assumption that she's Ramsey's wife.

Section Summary: Captain Ramsey is approached by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl and former tri-di star, who offers him a deal: she'll pay him to take her through hyper-space to Centauri in exchange for his piloting skills. Ramsey agrees, but only if a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After spending the night at Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has disappeared, leaving them locked in. While searching the apartment, Ramsey finds a letter that suggests Margot is searching for something significant related to the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter hints at a mysterious connection between the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth and the sudden appearance of humanoid types on thousands of stellar worlds millions of years ago.

Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, and they begin to work on a ship in a Spacer Graveyard, trying to escape the planet Irwadi while being pursued by the authorities. As they work on the ship, Margot reveals that she can read minds and suspects that they are being watched.

Chind is instructed to plant a fuel supply, U-235 capsules, in one of the wrecks to aid the trio's escape. Meanwhile, Vardin uses a scintillation counter to find the fuel supply, and Margot retrieves it, bringing them one step closer to completing their ship. Garr Symm's ultimate goal is to use the information to make Irwadi the dominant planet in the galaxy, with him as the absolute dictator.

Section section_07 (Chars 48070–56391):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison, a beautiful woman, is on a mission with Ramsey and Vardin, but she has an ulterior motive, seeking power rather than just relying on her beauty. They board the spaceship Enterprise, preparing for blastoff, while being watched by Ramar Chind and his crew on the Dog Star. As they enter hyper-space, Ramsey explains the concept of timelessness and the unique properties of hyper-space, which fascinate Margot. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and Ramar Chind are tracking the Enterprise using radar, which works perfectly in hyper-space due to the absence of time. The Enterprise encounters eddies in hyper-space, causing turbulence, and Ramsey struggles to keep the ship on course.

Section Summary: Margot Dennison overpowers Ramsey and forces him to land the Enterprise on a mysterious world in hyper-space, despite his warnings about meddling with a power beyond human understanding. Once they arrive, Margot discovers that the environment is hostile, with extreme cold and lack of atmosphere, but she becomes determined to venture out after Ramsey inadvertently reveals a potential way to survive the conditions. Margot plans to take Vardin with her, but Ramsey refuses, and a standoff ensues, with Margot threatening to use an m.g. gun. However, Ramsey points out that the gun is useless in the timeless continuum of hyper-space, where time is required for the gun's radioactive fuel to break down. Margot is undeterred and still plans to proceed with her plans, using Vardin as a potential hostage.

Section Summary: Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin venture outside the Enterprise, where they hear a beautiful, otherworldly music that seems to be the "Music of the Spheres". As they listen, the gray murk surrounding them begins to clear, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot identifies as a matter-transmitter. She approaches the box, which is said to hold the secret of instantaneous travel across the galaxy, but Ramsey has a vision of a cosmic game being played with proto-man, suggesting that this power is too great for humanity to wield. Just as Margot is about to reach the box, Garr Symm and his men appear, attempting to stop her and claim the box for themselves. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men, but is shocked when one of them dies from lack of air, despite being on a world where time does not exist.

Section Summary: Ramsey stops Margot from using the matter-transmission device, and instead, Garr Symm uses it and is transformed into a caveman-like creature. Vardin, a proto-man, reveals that his ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and Ramsey has helped him succeed. With the crisis averted, Ramsey and Margot leave the planet together, and Margot confesses her love for Ramsey. They blast off into space, ready to start a new life together, free from the dangers of the matter-transmission technology.
