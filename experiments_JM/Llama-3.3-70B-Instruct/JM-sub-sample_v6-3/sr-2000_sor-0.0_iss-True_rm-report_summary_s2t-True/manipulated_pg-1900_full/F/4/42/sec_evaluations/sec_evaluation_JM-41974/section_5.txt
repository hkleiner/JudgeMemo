2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Veronese's trip to Rome to his return to Venice
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter divisions seem arbitrary and disrupt the flow of the narrative
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and unclear, making it difficult to understand the author's point
