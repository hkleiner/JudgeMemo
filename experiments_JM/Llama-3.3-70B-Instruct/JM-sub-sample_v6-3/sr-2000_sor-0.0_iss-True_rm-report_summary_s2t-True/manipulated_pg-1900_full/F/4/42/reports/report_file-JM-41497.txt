Section section_03 (Chars 17596–26336):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned painter who had already achieved great success by 1769, having painted many famous men and women of his time. He was a member of the Dilettanti Society and had a wide circle of friends, including Dr. Johnson, with whom he traveled to Devonshire. Reynolds' studio in Leicester Square was a hub of activity, with a diverse range of sitters, including royalty, politicians, and actors, all seeking to be immortalized by his brush. Despite his success, Reynolds' paintings were not without their flaws, with many of his early works darkening and his later works fading due to his use of experimental pigments. Overall, Reynolds left a glorious heritage to his country, but his failure to master permanent coloring is a regrettable aspect of his legacy.

Section section_05 (Chars 34989–43596):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds spent his final years preparing for his death, sustained by memories of the past and surrounded by friends. He delivered his final address to students in 1790 and sat for a portrait by the Swedish artist von Breda, before passing away in 1792 at the age of 69. Reynolds' art continued to evolve throughout his life, and he is considered one of the greatest portrait painters of all time, able to hold his own against other masters. He was a skilled assimilator, taking inspiration from various artists, including Rembrandt, Titian, and Michelangelo, and synthesizing their styles to create his own unique approach. Reynolds' portraits of women and children often prioritized beauty and classical ideals over humanity and realism, but he was also capable of capturing more natural and playful moments in his work.

Section section_06 (Chars 43597–47061):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children lack a sense of intimacy, suggesting he had no deep interest in them. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his exceptional skill and ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' paintings of men are masterful, conveying their subjects' personalities and traits with simplicity and directness. However, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it difficult to appreciate his work at its best. Despite this, Reynolds' reputation as a great artist remains, and his name is still revered in the art world.
