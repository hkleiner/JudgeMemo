In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The two pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna period, Amenophis III and IV, belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had expanded Egypt's borders through conquests, but under these kings, the focus shifted from war to other pursuits, including a religious reform introduced by Amenophis IV."

The king's efforts were met with resistance, leading to open strife and the eventual removal of the court to a new city, Akhet-Aten. The new doctrine was not widely accepted, and many officials and vassals continued to refer to the old gods, with some even correcting the king's new name to reflect the old religion. The Asiatic provinces, which enjoyed self-government under Egyptian supremacy, were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute disputes, and the immigration of Bedaw√¨n tribes, leading to a state of chaos and instability. The king's attempts to maintain control and collect tribute were often unsuccessful, and the region was marked by constant struggles and alliances between various factions and tribes."

The Egyptian government, despite being well-informed, took a middle course of sending small, inadequate military expeditions, which sometimes restored temporary peace but ultimately failed to check serious hostilities. The letters from Asian kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relations, with the Egyptian king being reluctant to give away daughters in marriage due to their perceived divine status. These letters also show that the Egyptian king's claims to divine honors caused difficulties in diplomatic intercourse, with other kings like Kadashman-Bel appreciating and mocking this weakness. The correspondence between Egyptian kings and their Asian counterparts, such as Kadashman-Bel and Tushratta of Mitani, provides valuable insights into the politics and alliances of the time."

Tushratta's letters to Nimmuria were initially respectful and affectionate, but later became filled with requests for gold, revealing his greedy nature. After Nimmuria's death, Tushratta's relationship with the new Egyptian king, Akhenaten (also known as Napkhuria), deteriorated due to Akhenaten's insolent tone and neglect of traditional diplomatic etiquette. Akhenaten's actions also strained Egypt's relationships with other kingdoms, including Babylonia, which led to retaliatory measures and a decline in diplomatic relations.

The city of Tunip and Rib-Addi of Gebal sent complaints to Pharaoh about Aziru's aggressive actions, but he managed to evade punishment by conspiring with Egyptian officials and inventing threats from Hittite invaders. Eventually, Aziru was summoned to the Egyptian court and arrested, but his rise to power had brought a measure of stability to the region, ending a period of lawlessness and petty raids by other chiefs. Despite his questionable methods, Aziru's actions were seen as beneficial by some Syrian and Phoenician princes, who preferred his rule to the previous state of chaos."
