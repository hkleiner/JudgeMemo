Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a legend that their forefathers came from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and they still retain their language, although some have become amalgamated with the Chinese. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who are responsible for the local administration and education, and learned about the village's customs and way of life. The Sarö Yögurs pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their language has a resemblance to Khirgis and Turkish, but they have no written language or recorded history.

The monastery's temple, known as the Yögur temple, was a large and impressive structure with Tibetan influence, featuring Buddhist pictures, banners, and a bronze statue of Tsunkoa. The lamas, who numbered only around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading services. The author eventually left the monastery, saying goodbye to the lamas and departing with the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo, as their guide.
