Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" revealed the underlying law of evolution, where the simple develops into the complex through successive differentiations. The author was drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, leading to a higher complication and progress. Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy, which encompassed biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, was groundbreaking and influential, with experts like Charles Darwin and William James praising its originality. Despite some limitations, Spencer's work had a significant impact on the author's understanding of evolution and its applications to various fields."

Despite this, his philosophy had a significant impact on the development of thought, particularly in the areas of evolution and the universality of law. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the idea of evolution as a universal principle, governed by the persistence of force, which he saw as the ultimate basis of all enforcement. However, his concept of the \"Unknowable\" - the ultimate reality that underlies all phenomena - is seen as a limitation of his philosophy, as it introduces an unanswerable question that science cannot address. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy is characterized by its attempt to unify knowledge and interpret all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force."

Both Spencer and Bergson believe that the ultimate source of evolution is unknowable by the intellect, with Spencer referring to it as the \"Unknowable\" and Bergson calling it \"Life\". Bergson criticizes Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution from the fragments of the evolved, arguing that this approach cannot reveal the principle of evolution. Despite their differences, both thinkers seek to understand the source of phenomena, with Spencer's philosophy emphasizing the concept of a noumenal source that underlies all phenomena. The section also touches on the concept of cause and effect, noting that Spencer's treatment of these concepts is sometimes puzzling and has been subject to criticism from other philosophers."

Clifford, who argued that an exact knowledge of facts can supersede the need to inquire about their causes. In science, relatedness and change are key concepts, and simple types of relatedness, such as gravitation, can be expressed in formulae that describe the rate of change. The idea of energy as an active agent that produces change is also problematic, and modern science views energy as a constant ratio of variables that describes the changes themselves. The concept of force can be understood as a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness among things, rather than a cause or agent that produces change. Ultimately, the distinction between cause and conditions is not clear-cut, and scientists such as Mill have argued that the cause is the sum total of all conditions, both positive and negative."

The author critiques Spencer's terminology, particularly his use of \"states of consciousness\" and \"subjective affections,\" which can be ambiguous and perplexing. The author argues that an adequate analysis of cognitive relatedness is still lacking, but it must be dealt with in a scientific philosophy on lines analogous to those of other relational problems.

Cognition, or knowledge in the proper sense, is a mode of relatedness that emerged at some stage of evolution and is dependent on underlying physiological and physico-chemical processes.

Instead, the author suggests that cognitive relatedness is a complex and effective relationship between an organism and its environment, which is not reciprocal and implies changes in the system. The author concludes that Spencer's work, despite its limitations, was influential and significant, and that his commitment to uttering the truth he saw, even if unpopular, is admirable. Ultimately, the author advocates for a more modest and scientific approach to understanding cognitive processes and their relationship to the natural world."
