Section section_03 (Chars 17606–26341):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a prominent figure in the art world, and his contributions to the exhibitions of the Society of Artists were widely admired. He had a large circle of friends and acquaintances, and his home in Leicester Square was open to many notable figures of the time.

Despite this, he left a glorious heritage to his country, and his portraits are characterized by a sane and optimistic note, capturing the best in his sitters. Reynolds' personal life was marked by self-control and virtue, which sometimes led to speculation and criticism from his biographers, particularly regarding his relationship with the artist Angelica Kaufmann.

Section Summary: After receiving a knighthood in 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds' social status and reputation continued to grow, and he became more selective with his portrait commissions.

Section section_05 (Chars 34996–43598):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds spent his final years preparing for his death, sustained by memories of the past and surrounded by friends.

Section section_06 (Chars 43599–47064):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children lack a sense of intimacy, suggesting he had no deep interest in them. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his exceptional skill and ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' vision was comprehensive, and his portraits were masterful in their simplicity and directness, making it difficult for other artists to approach the same subjects. However, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it challenging to appreciate his work at its best. Despite this, Reynolds' name and fame remain a source of pride in British art and a subject of admiration worldwide.
