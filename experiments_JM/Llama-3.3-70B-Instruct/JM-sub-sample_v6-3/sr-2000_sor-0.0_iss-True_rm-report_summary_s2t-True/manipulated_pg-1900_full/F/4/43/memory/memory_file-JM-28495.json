They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the dog home, but their attempts at getting directions are thwarted, including a humorous encounter with a mischievous street boy. The couple then spots a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decides to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to the dog home. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and comical."

The narrator cut the string, and they took the puppy home, eventually naming it Excalibur, or Scally for short. As Scally grew up, he became a unique and loyal companion, often accompanying the family on walks and exhibiting a respectful pertinacity despite his humble and awkward appearance."

Despite being told to go home, Excalibur follows the narrator on a walk and eventually meets up with them at a crossroads.

However, his memory is poor, as evidenced by an incident where he forgets where he buried a bone, leading to a frantic search and eventual lockdown in the washhouse. Excalibur's antics often cause chaos, including a notable incident where he hides a bone in a cushion behind a guest, Lady Wickham, during a dinner party."
