Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is stranded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot's license. With no ship to pilot, Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the vital metal titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel.

Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Later, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi, where he encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Security Police. Symm insults Ramsey and orders him to leave, and when Ramsey refuses, Symm throws a drink in his face. The situation is tense, with many outworlders present, but Ramsey chooses not to react violently. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations of the Irwadian government, which is trying to reduce outworld influence.

When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, and she teases him about his situation with Mith, who mistakenly thinks the Earthgirl is Ramsey's wife.

After a night at Margot's apartment, she disappears, leaving Ramsey and the Vegan girl locked in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter from someone who claims to have discovered the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which may be connected to the origin of humanoid life in the galaxy.

Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, to escape from the planet Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security.

Margot decides to venture out onto the world, taking Vardin with her, and uses the threat of an m.g. gun to ensure Ramsey's compliance. However, Ramsey points out that the gun is useless in the timeless continuum of hyper-space, where time-based processes like radioactive breakdown cannot occur. Margot remains resolute in her decision to explore the world, driven by her desire to uncover its secrets.

Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with proto-man, and he becomes concerned about the implications of her accessing the matter-transmitter. Just as Margot approaches the box, Garr Symm and his men appear, trying to stop her, and a physical confrontation ensues. Despite being on a timeless world where death is supposedly impossible, one of the Irwadi men dies after his space suit is damaged, revealing that the rules of this world may not be as absolute as they seemed.
