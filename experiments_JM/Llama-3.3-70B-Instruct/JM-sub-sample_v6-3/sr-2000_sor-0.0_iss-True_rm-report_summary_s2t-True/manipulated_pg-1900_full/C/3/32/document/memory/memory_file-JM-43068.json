        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. Millet's style is influenced by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a 16th-century painter who is now recognized as a great master of peasant painting. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are infused with a deep understanding of the struggles and sorrows of the peasants he depicted. His work is not just about technique, but about conveying a message and capturing the essence of the people and landscape he painted. Millet's unique style and approach to painting have made him a significant figure in the world of art, and his work continues to be appreciated for its simplicity, sincerity, and emotional depth."

His artwork often featured lonely, laborious scenes, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", which highlighted the monotony and importance of rural work. Millet's brush was a means to an end, used to illustrate his philosophical observations and convey a message rather than showcase technical skill. He was particularly inspired by the spring season and the themes of hard work, duty, and the cycle of life. Millet's unique approach to art, prioritizing meaning over technical brilliance, sets him apart from other painters and makes his work enduring and thought-provoking."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Normandy and grew up surrounded by the harsh yet beautiful landscape, which would later influence his art. His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing significant roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family encouraged his artistic pursuits. He eventually left his rural home to pursue a career in art, laying the foundation for his future success as a leading figure in the modern naturalistic school."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm to manage it, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue his artistic passion, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to support his move to Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre and developed his own unique style. However, his time in Paris was not without challenges, and he struggled to find his place in the art world, even briefly studying with the unsuitable Delaroche. Ultimately, Millet was freed to pursue his own artistic vision, despite the difficulties of poverty and the dominant artistic styles of the time."

Despite facing many challenges, including poverty and rejection, Millet persevered and continued to create art that reflected his unique perspective.

However, his health began to decline due to a persistent cough, and he eventually passed away on January 20, 1875. Millet's art is characterized by his passionate sympathy with the common people, particularly peasants, and his ability to convey the struggles and hardships of their daily lives. His work had a profound influence on other artists, including Segantini, and his sincere and profound art continues to be admired for its purity and truth. Millet's legacy is that of a poet, philosopher, and great thinker who expressed himself through his art, leaving a lasting impact on the world."
