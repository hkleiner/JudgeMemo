To gain access, the author seeks help from influential people, including a duchess who has established hospitals near the front lines. After a month of waiting, the author finally receives a carnet rouge, a permit that allows her to visit certain areas, but is initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which are not her desired destinations. She persuades the officials to grant her access to other areas, including Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, but is denied permission to visit Verdun due to the risks. The author eventually visits the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she is struck by the sight of vast fields of graves marked by flags and crosses."

The author suggests that instead of rebuilding, the ruins should be left intact as a reminder of the war's horrors and a potential source of revenue from tourism. The author visited the ruined town of Gerbéviller, where they saw families living in cellars and women running businesses, and noted that the town's picturesque ruins could be preserved without sacrificing space for new homes. The author also reflected on the German army's destruction of towns and their attempts to loot valuable objects, and noted that they were unable to visit the town of Arras due to ongoing bombardment. The author was ultimately unable to visit the town of Thann, despite efforts to obtain permission from military headquarters."

Major C. attempted to secure permission for the group to visit the front lines, but was unsuccessful, which left him disappointed and frustrated. The group took a break to eat and rest, and the narrator observed the conservative nature of the French people, as well as the unique individuality of the children. The narrator and her companions later visited the home of their Lieutenant, where they were shown a propaganda leaflet dropped by a German plane, which contained false and self-righteous claims about the French and English. The group was amused by the leaflet's absurdity, but also aware of the serious problem it represented, and they were soon reminded of the reality of war as they saw a military train passing by, carrying soldiers to the front lines."

The society, led by Mme. d'Andigné, aims to supply hospitals with delicacies such as chicken broth, fruits, and preserves, which are not provided by the military dietary kitchen. These items are essential for the recovery of wounded soldiers, who often have sensitive stomachs and cannot tolerate the standard military diet of milk and eggs. The society relies on voluntary subscriptions and donations to fund its efforts, and its work is crucial in boosting the morale and aiding the recovery of soldiers in the war zone. By providing these essential items, the society hopes to make a significant difference in the lives of wounded soldiers and support their recovery."

The author visited several military hospitals in France, where they observed the care and treatment of wounded soldiers, including the use of bathtubs to clean and refresh them before operations. The hospitals were well-run and clean, but the author notes that some smaller hospitals were in need of supplies, such as pillows. The author also highlights the generosity and gratitude of the French people, particularly the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie, who are working tirelessly to support the war effort despite their own financial struggles. The French people are appreciative of American support and generosity, which is helping to boost the morale and recovery of wounded soldiers."
