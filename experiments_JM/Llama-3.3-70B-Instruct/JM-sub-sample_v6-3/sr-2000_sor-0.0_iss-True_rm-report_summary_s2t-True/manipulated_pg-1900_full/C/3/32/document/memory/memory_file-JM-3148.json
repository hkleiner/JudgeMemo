Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin.

He spent most of his time outdoors, observing and learning about the world around him, and developed a deep understanding of nature and its secrets. Despite being considered lazy by the villagers, Tony was actually a diligent and industrious learner, teaching himself about music, instruments, and repair. He developed a particular passion for music and instruments, and by the age of 15, had taken apart and repaired numerous instruments in the village. Through his self-directed learning, Tony gained a unique set of skills and knowledge that set him apart from his peers."

Despite this, he continued to develop his skills, studying the characteristics of great violin models and making a precious discovery of a piece of old wood that he hoped to one day use to make a perfect violin. As he worked, Anthony was driven by a desire to create something beautiful and to use his gifts to make a positive impact on the world. He was inspired by the example of Antonius Stradivarius, a master violin maker, and sought to follow in his footsteps by cherishing his sight and touch and striving for perfection in his work. Through his dedication and hard work, Anthony was able to develop a deep understanding of music and the art of violin making, despite his limited formal education."

She was now 40 years old, but still had a youthful heart, with her emotions and passions intact. As she settled into her new home, Lyddy had few visitors, and Aunt Hitty disapproved of her decision to remove the silver coffin-plates, which had been a cherished possession of her aunt."

As they sat together in the apple orchard, Anthony worked on composing music using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs, which Lyddy would transcribe into written form. The music was a reflection of their love and the beauty of nature surrounding them, with Lyddy interpreting it as a dream of the future and a celebration of new life and hope. In this peaceful and idyllic setting, Lyddy and Anthony shared a deep connection and love for each other, with their relationship filled with joy, promise, and sweetness."
