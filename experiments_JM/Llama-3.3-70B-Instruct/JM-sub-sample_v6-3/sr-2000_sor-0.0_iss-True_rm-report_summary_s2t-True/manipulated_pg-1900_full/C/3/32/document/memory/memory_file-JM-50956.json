The country's early offensives and diversion of German and Austrian forces helped the Allies, particularly in the battles of the Marne and Verdun. Russia's efforts weakened the enemy, consuming their resources and forces, and ultimately contributed to the Allied victory in 1918. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, the Russian Army's heroism and sacrifices were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome."

This diversion ultimately led to Germany's defeat at the Battle of the Marne, a turning point in the war. Russian historian argues that Germany's military leader, Ludendorf, distorts the facts in his memoirs to downplay Russia's role in the war and exaggerate his own achievements. Despite being unprepared and outnumbered, Russia's sacrifice in the early days of the war was crucial in preventing Germany from winning a quick victory. The Russian advance into East Prussia is recognized as a key factor in the ultimate defeat of Germany, and its importance should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts."

The Russian Army's operations in October and November 1914, particularly at Warsaw, forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers to the Eastern front, abandoning their offensive at Ypres and delaying their attack on France for over a year. This decision was largely due to the Russian Army's efforts, which compelled the Germans to focus on the Eastern front and restrict their operations in the West to a defensive. As a result, the Germans were unable to win the war in France, and Russia played a decisive part in the critical moments of the war. The Russian Army's sacrifices and efforts ultimately contributed to the German defeat and changed the course of the war."

This allowed the Allies, particularly France and England, to regroup, recover, and prepare for future battles, including the German offensive at Verdun in 1916. The Russian Army's ability to resist the German advances, although forced to retreat, prevented the Germans from achieving a decisive victory and exploiting their successes. According to Ludendorf's own memoirs, the German Army's lack of reserves, which were being depleted by the Russian front, hindered their ability to achieve a breakthrough on the Western front. Overall, Russia's sacrifices in 1915 contributed significantly to the Allied war effort, giving them a much-needed respite to prepare for future battles."

In 1916, the Russian Army launched a successful offensive on the Austrian front, despite not being prepared for it, which forced the Austrians to abandon their offensive in Italy and transfer troops to the Russian front. This offensive had far-reaching effects, also impacting the situation on the French front, where the Allies were able to launch a successful counter-offensive at the Somme. The Russian Army continued to provide crucial assistance to its allies, including helping to defend Romania from invasion in late 1916. Despite facing its own challenges and eventual collapse in 1917, the Russian Army still managed to tie up significant enemy forces, ultimately benefiting the Allies."

Russia's sacrifices were enormous, with over 12 million casualties, and its participation was essential to the Allied victory. Despite fighting under difficult circumstances, including a lack of arms and ammunition, Russia was able to defeat Germany when it had even a small superiority of force. The author argues that Russia's importance will continue in the future, and that it will remain a significant military and political factor in Europe, making it essential for statesmen to consider its role in maintaining a balance of power. The author warns that ignoring Russia's potential, even in its current weakened state, would be a mistake, as it will inevitably recover and regain its strength."
