        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder and enthusiasm of Christmas, but adults have lost some of that faith and excitement, and now often view the holiday as a time of indulgence and obligation. The author argues that this decline in the significance of Christmas is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. This has led to a decline in faith and a focus on facts, causing people to question the validity of Christmas and its traditions. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, such as faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are essential for humanity's existence and happiness. The celebration of Christmas on December 25th, coinciding with the winter solstice, is a symbolic moment that represents the triumph of hope and light over darkness. Ultimately, the author suggests that despite the changes brought about by science and skepticism, the true spirit of Christmas endures and is necessary for humanity's well-being."

Despite the decline of other faiths, the idea of universal goodwill is alive and vibrant, inspiring many literary artists and social reformers. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster faith in goodwill, providing a concrete symbol of an intangible idea. Christmas, with its traditions and spirit of peace and goodwill, is particularly well-suited to promote this faith, and its customs, such as gift-giving and sending cards, can be powerful expressions of sympathy and kindness. By embracing these traditions, people can reconnect with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood that underlies the holiday."

However, the author also emphasizes the importance of moderation and dignity, warning against taking excess to extremes. The author suggests that the spiritual benefits of feasting, including the acceptance of ridiculousness and the expansion of one's common sense, are essential to the human experience. To revitalize the Christmas festival, which has lost some of its old vitality, the author proposes focusing on the cultivation of goodwill, a element that unites people across different sects and beliefs. By concentrating on goodwill, the festival can acquire a fresh and genuine significance without overthrown tradition or causing shock."

Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill in their own heart by thinking thoughts of kindness and compassion towards others. The author suggests starting with a small group of people, such as those in one's daily life, and specializing in one person who often inspires feelings of irritation or superiority. To cultivate goodwill towards this person, one must use their imagination to understand and sympathize with their feelings, difficulties, and struggles. By doing so, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the other person, and ultimately increase their goodwill towards them."

Despite this, individuals will continue to strive for their goals and ideals, even if they seem unattainable, as it is human nature to do so. The concept of New Year's resolutions is explored, with the understanding that they are often made in an attempt to organize and give direction to one's efforts, despite the likelihood of failure. Ultimately, the pursuit of ideals and goals is driven by a fundamental aspect of human nature, which compels individuals to strive for more, even in the face of adversity."
