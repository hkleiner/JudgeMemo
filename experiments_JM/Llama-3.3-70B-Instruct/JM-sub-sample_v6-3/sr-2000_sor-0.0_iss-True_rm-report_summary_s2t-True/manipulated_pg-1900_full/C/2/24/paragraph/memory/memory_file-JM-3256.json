        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than just collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary knowledge, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen but are actually just pretentious collectors, while others, like the quiet men who read classic literature in their free time, are true bookmen without realizing it. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular literature and timeless, meaningful works."

This type of literature, considered a classic, is characterized by its wisdom, style, and ability to transcend generations. The bookman has a diverse taste in literature, enjoying works by authors such as Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey, and appreciates the essay as a particularly delightful form of literature. He is not concerned with the respectability of the writer or the accuracy of the information, but rather with the writer's ability to convey their thoughts and experiences in a vivid and engaging way. The bookman's love affair with literature begins with classic novels like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\", which remain dear to him throughout his life."

As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works had a lasting impact on their literary tastes. The author notes that these classic authors remain their favorites, offering a sense of comfort and pleasure that is hard to find in modern literature. They particularly cherish the works of Thackeray and Scott, citing books like \"Henry Esmond\" and \"The Heart of Midlothian\" as examples of masterful storytelling. The author's nostalgia for these childhood favorites is a testament to the enduring power of great literature to captivate and inspire readers."

The author also imagines a holiday spent in a library, surrounded by books and a beautiful garden, as the perfect retreat. Additionally, the author fantasizes about hosting a meeting of bookmen, inviting historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Charles Lamb to share their passion for books."

A book lover's passion for collecting rare and beautiful books can lead to financial struggles and neglect of family responsibilities. The author draws a parallel between bibliomania and dipsomania, suggesting that the only cure for a bookman is total abstinence from buying rare books. Despite the best intentions, a bookman may struggle to resist the temptation of buying more books, often leading to clever attempts to hide new purchases from their spouse. Ultimately, the author portrays the bookman's wife as the sufferer and good angel, trying to intervene and save her family from the consequences of her husband's obsession."

Ultimately, his love for books is a lifelong passion that brings him joy and fulfillment until the end of his life."
