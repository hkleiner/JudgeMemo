Section section_04 (Chars 25310–33768):
Section Summary: Veronese's painting, "The Wedding at Cana", is a masterpiece that showcases his skill in composition and balance, despite its historical inaccuracies and anachronisms. The painting features a mix of biblical figures and contemporary personalities, including the artist himself and other notable painters of the time. Veronese's work was widely admired, but it also drew criticism from traditionalists who saw his introduction of fantastical elements as irreverent. He was summoned before the Inquisition in 1573 to defend his work, but was able to avoid severe punishment by showing contrition and agreeing to modify one of his paintings. Ultimately, Veronese's art was able to transcend criticism and earn him widespread renown, with his paintings remaining some of the most beautiful and celebrated in the world.
