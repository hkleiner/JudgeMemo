On July 23, 1901, the US Government sent 499 trained men and women to the Philippines to implement this system. The author traveled to the Philippines via the Hawaiian Islands, where they visited notable sites such as the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology.

The author describes the bustling scene on the old stone bridge, where people from various nationalities and professions are rushing to and fro. After spending two weeks in Manila, the author and other teachers received a notice to prepare for assignment to remote areas, sparking concern and a mass meeting. The teachers were eventually persuaded to proceed to their stations, relying on the hospitality of the locals for their needs. The author then travels to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros, where they witness a poignant scene of native women bidding farewell to departing troops."

The narrative then shifts to the Philippines, where the author describes the typical town of Bacalod and the challenges faced by American teachers who arrived to establish schools. The teachers were tasked with making English the basis of instruction and faced difficulties such as lack of schoolhouses and supplies. Despite these challenges, the teachers made progress, and by the end of a year, two schools were operating successfully in the town of Talisay. The author also recounts a social event, a \"baile,\" hosted by the town of Silay, where they were honored guests and struggled to communicate with the locals due to language barriers."

The Filipinos were well-dressed and wore expensive jewelry, showcasing their wealth and love for luxury. In contrast to the refined life in Manila, the narrator notes that life in the countryside is much simpler and more laid-back, with a focus on harmless inactivity. The narrator also shares their experience of trying to manage a household with Filipino servants, which proved to be challenging due to the complex system of dependents and allowances. Overall, the narrator observes that life in the Philippines is a mix of luxury and simplicity, depending on the location and social status."

The wealthy Filipinos live in large, polished houses with many servants, while the poor, known as the \"tao\", live in humble homes and struggle to find enough food to eat. The tao's diet consists mainly of rice and fish, which they eat with their hands, and they often go hungry. In contrast, the middle class of Filipinos fills the gap between the rich and the poor, with a more moderate lifestyle. The author also describes a visit to a leper colony, where they received a hostile reception from the inhabitants, highlighting the challenges and hardships faced by those living on the margins of society."

Despite the difficulties, the author notes that the people in the colony still experience emotions like love, hatred, and joy, just like anyone else. The author also goes on a \"hike\" with troops, pursuing a group of ladrones, and describes the contrast between the primitive Filipino guards and the modern American soldiers. The hike ultimately becomes too strenuous, and the author and their companion return to the post in a cart, exhausted and blistered."
