Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" explained that progress is the evolution of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations, a concept that resonated with the author. The author believes that this essay contains the germ of all that is best in Spencer's teaching and that his method was most effectively employed in interpreting biological phenomena. Spencer's work had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and his contributions to these subjects are still recognized today. Overall, Spencer's philosophy emphasized the importance of biological relationships and the concept of evolution, which he applied to various aspects of life and society."

He believed in the universality of law, applying to both the physical and mental realms, and that there must be an underlying source or power driving this evolution. Spencer's philosophy was all-inclusive, encompassing biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and he sought to interpret all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, he acknowledged that there is an Unknowable Reality that underlies all existence, which is beyond human understanding. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy aimed to provide a unified and comprehensive understanding of the world, despite the limitations of human knowledge."

Bergson criticizes Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution by dividing the evolved into fragments, arguing that this approach fails to reveal the principle of evolution. Bergson's own doctrine posits that the intellect portions the world into distinct lots, rendering them artificially separate from the continuous whole of reality. In contrast, Spencer seeks to understand the Source of phenomena, which he believes is the Unknowable, a fundamental tenet of his philosophy. Spencer's treatment of the philosophy of science emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, but his statements on this topic are often puzzling and ambiguous. Ultimately, the concept of cause is problematic, and some philosophers, such as Bertrand Russell and Professor Mach, have argued that it should be discarded or redefined to avoid misleading associations."

Herbert Spencer's attempt to reduce all kinds of relatedness to a single mechanical type was unsuccessful, and his idea of \"persistence of force\" can be replaced by the concept of sameness of differential equations in simple systems. The author argues that the concept of \"cause\" is not necessary in scientific interpretation, and that the term \"effective\" can be used to describe the modes of relatedness that imply certain changes. The idea of \"force\" can be understood as a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness, rather than an agent that produces change. The author also discusses the distinction between \"cause\" and \"conditions,\" suggesting that the term \"ground\" can be used to designate the inherent and constitutional aspects of a self-contained system."

To better understand the world, the author proposes that we need to consider the various modes of relatedness that exist within it, rather than reducing them to a single, mechanical type. By recognizing the complexity of relatedness, we can work towards a more comprehensive understanding of the constitution of nature and the world around us."

There are different types of relatedness, including physico-chemical, vital, and cognitive, each with its own unique properties and characteristics. As we move from one type to another, new properties emerge that are not simply the sum of the individual components, but rather constitutive of the new whole. This concept is related to the idea of creative evolution, where new properties and relationships arise through the process of evolution. The author argues that science should strive to understand and describe these relationships and properties, rather than simply taking them for granted or invoking special agencies to explain them."

The author argues that Spencer's analysis of cognitive relatedness is not adequate and that a scientific approach to understanding cognition is still lacking. The author also discusses the importance of considering the vital or physiological aspects of an organism's processes, which cannot be reduced to purely physico-chemical explanations.

The relationship between cognitive processes and physiological processes is one of correlation, not parallelism, with cognition implying a physiological basis.
