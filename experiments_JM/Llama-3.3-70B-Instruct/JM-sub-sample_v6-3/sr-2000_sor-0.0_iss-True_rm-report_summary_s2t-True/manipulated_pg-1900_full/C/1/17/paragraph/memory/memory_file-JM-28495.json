They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief from a street boy. They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they continue to follow the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart."

Eventually, the man led them to his home, where he and his wife disappeared inside, leaving the couple exhausted and dogless. Later that evening, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy that had been thrown into a pond with a brick tied to it. They took the puppy in and spent several days deciding on a name, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Excal for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a unique and humble-minded companion, with a rather unusual appearance."

Meanwhile, Eileen and the curate are discussing their future together, with the curate revealing that he has a limited income and they will have to make sacrifices if they want to be together. The curate believes that living on a limited income would be too humiliating and difficult, and suggests that he may have to leave the area in order to improve their situation.
