        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among other great artists of his time. His work is characterized by a profound understanding of the struggles and simplicity of rural life, which he experienced firsthand through his own life of struggle and hardship. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" are marked by a sense of earnestness and melancholy truth, capturing the dignity and poverty of peasant life. Despite some critics labeling his work as sentimental, Millet's art is a powerful portrayal of the human struggle and the importance of religious faith in the lives of rural people. His unique style and perspective were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters and his own gentle disposition."

To fully appreciate his work, one must be familiar with the countryside he depicted, as the subtleties of atmosphere and line are unique to each region. Millet's paintings often capture the loneliness and simplicity of peasant life, highlighting the importance of their labor and daily struggles. He is more of a philosopher than a painter, using his brush to illustrate the fruits of his observations and convey a deeper meaning. Millet's greatness lies in his ability to portray the human side of rural life, making his paintings more than just technical exercises, but rather a window into the lives of the people he depicted."

        "section_summary": "In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged landscape and harsh weather conditions shaping his perspective. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a contemplative disposition, which was encouraged by his family, particularly his father, who recognized his artistic talent. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family supported his artistic pursuits, eventually leading him to meet with a painter in Cherbourg to showcase his work. This marked the beginning of Millet's journey towards becoming a prominent figure in the modern naturalistic school of art."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his passion for art led him to eventually return to Cherbourg and study under M. Langlois, a classically trained artist. Langlois, although unable to appreciate Millet's unique style, helped him secure a pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of masters like Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin. In Paris, Millet briefly studied under Delaroche, but found his academic style stifling and eventually struck out on his own, struggling to make a living from his art. Despite the challenges, Millet was determined to develop his own unique style and work towards recognition as an artist."

He eventually found success and a sense of community in Barbizon, where he settled and focused on depicting the lives of peasants. Millet's art was driven by his fascination with the daily struggles and joys of rural life, and he found inspiration in the people and landscapes around him. In contrast to his fellow artist Rousseau, who preferred to paint landscapes and solitude, Millet was drawn to the human aspect of rural life and the stories of the people who worked the land. By living a simple life among the peasants he painted, Millet was able to tap into his creative powers and produce some of his most notable works."

His paintings were initially sold for low prices, but later became highly valued, with \"The Angelus\" being sold for 800,000 francs. Millet's later years were marked by personal losses, including the death of his friend Rousseau, and declining health, which ultimately led to his death on January 20, 1875. Throughout his life, Millet remained true to his artistic vision, driven by his genius and passion, despite the challenges he faced."

His sincere and emotionally charged works continue to resonate with audiences, offering a poignant portrayal of the human experience."
