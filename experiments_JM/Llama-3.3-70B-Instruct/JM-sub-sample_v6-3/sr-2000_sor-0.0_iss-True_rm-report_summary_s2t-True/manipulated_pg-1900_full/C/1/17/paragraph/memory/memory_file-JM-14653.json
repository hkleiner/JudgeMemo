        "section_summary": "The section begins with a historical account of a military explosion on July 30, but quickly shifts to a nostalgic and introspective tone, describing the magic of Christmas and how it is kept alive by children. The author notes that as adults, people often lose the genuine excitement and joy of Christmas, and instead have to force themselves to feel festive. The author argues that Christmas has lost some of its magic, and that this is a fact that cannot be disputed. The section concludes by suggesting that the decline of Christmas is not just a personal or subjective experience, but rather a broader cultural phenomenon that requires examination and understanding. The author sets the stage for exploring the reasons behind this decline in the next chapter."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has diminished among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists who promoted an age of doubt and skepticism. This era of questioning led people to abandon faith and enthusiasm, not just for religious beliefs, but also for principles and ideals. Despite the changes brought about by science and philosophy, the fundamental principles of faith, goodwill, and morality remain intact. The Christmas feast was fixed on December 25 to coincide with the winter solstice, a pre-Christian festival celebrating the triumph of light over darkness, which symbolizes hope and renewal. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit, rooted in faith and goodwill, remains essential to human existence and is conserved in the hearts of the simple and the great, even if it seems weakened in times of change."

The idea of social justice, which means putting goodwill into practice and recognizing the brotherhood of mankind, is seen as a flourishing faith in modern times. A festival, such as Christmas, is necessary to celebrate and foster this faith, as it provides a concrete symbol of goodwill and mutual confidence. Christmas, with its traditional spirit of peace and goodwill, is considered the most appropriate festival to celebrate this faith. By observing Christmas customs, such as sending cards and giving gifts, people can demonstrate their sympathy and goodwill towards one another, but only if done with sincerity and thoughtfulness."

By concentrating on this aspect, the festival can regain its significance and authenticity without disrupting traditional practices. Ultimately, the author believes that a renewed emphasis on goodwill can bring new life to the Christmas celebration."

Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill in their own heart and towards a small, specific group of people, such as those they interact with daily. The author suggests starting with one person who frequently annoys them, and using imagination to understand and sympathize with that person's feelings and perspective. By doing so, one can increase their goodwill towards that person and ultimately contribute to the greater good. This process requires effort and practice, but can lead to more harmonious relationships and a greater sense of understanding and empathy."
