Section section_01 (Chars 0–7862):
Section Summary: The section "BOOKS AND BOOKMEN" explores the difference between a book owner and a true bookman, highlighting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A bookman is someone who has a deep love and appreciation for books, and is not just a collector. The author illustrates this point through a personal anecdote about a wealthy host who owns an impressive library, but is not a true bookman. The section also touches on the idea that a critic's role is to distinguish between books that are fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact on the human mind. Ultimately, a true bookman is someone who values the content and wisdom of books, rather than just their physical appearance or monetary value.

Section Summary: The bookman has a deep love for literature, particularly essays, and enjoys reading authors such as Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey.
