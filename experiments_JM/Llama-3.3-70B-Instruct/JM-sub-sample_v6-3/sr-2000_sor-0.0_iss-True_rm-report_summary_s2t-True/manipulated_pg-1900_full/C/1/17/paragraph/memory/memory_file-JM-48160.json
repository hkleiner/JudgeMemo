The author, determined to visit the front lines, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a \"carnet rouge\" and is allowed to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as initially desired. The author is offered alternative destinations, including Meaux, which they visit and describe as a somber and impressive sight, with fields of graves and cemeteries. Despite the restrictions, the author is determined to see more of the war zone and continues to push for access to other areas, including Verdun and Nancy."

In Châlons, the narrator had to obtain permission to stay in the town and was eventually allowed to do so after their papers were stamped. The town was quiet and gray, with many shops closed and a sense of stillness and oppression in the air."

Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, but the narrator was able to observe the war zone up close, seeing soldiers, artillery, and camions. The narrator noted that many soldiers seemed to be loafing, waiting to be called to the front, and that the roads were surprisingly well-maintained despite the heavy traffic. The trip provided the narrator with a unique perspective on the war zone, one that was different from what they would have seen by train."

The narrator then shifts to discussing a new organization, \"Le Bienêtre du Blessé,\" a French-American society aimed at providing comfort and care to wounded soldiers. The organization, led by Mme. d'Andigné, aims to provide a more varied diet for convalescent soldiers, as the standard military hospital diet of milk and eggs is often not sufficient.

These items are crucial in boosting the morale and aiding the recovery of wounded soldiers, who often crave sweet treats like preserves due to their high sugar content. The program, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, has been successful in providing these necessities, and the author witnessed its positive impact during a visit to a hospital near Bar-le-Duc. The hospital visits also highlighted the importance of private kitchens in hospitals, which allow nurses to provide sustenance to patients outside of regular kitchen hours, potentially saving lives."
