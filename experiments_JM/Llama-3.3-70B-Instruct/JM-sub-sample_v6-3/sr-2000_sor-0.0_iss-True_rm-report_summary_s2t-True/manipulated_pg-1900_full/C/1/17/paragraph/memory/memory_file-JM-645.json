Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to assist his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator agrees to write the review and spends the night reading the novel, but later worries that his review may not have done justice to Vereker's work. He meets Vereker at a social gathering, where Lady Jane praises the narrator's review and tries to get Vereker to read it, but Vereker politely declines at first, only to take the review to read later. The narrator is anxious to know if Vereker likes his review, and is aware that Corvick was not satisfied with it, having written to him from Paris to express his disappointment."

However, later that night, Vereker approaches the narrator and explains that his harsh words were not meant to be hurtful, but rather a result of his own frustration with critics who consistently miss the point of his work. Vereker reveals that he feels like a failure because his \"little point\" is always misunderstood, even by clever critics like the narrator. The narrator is intrigued and eager to learn more about Vereker's elusive \"little point\"."

Corvick was determined to uncover the truth on his own, without seeking Vereker's direct input, and saw it as a challenge to be solved. The narrator notes that Corvick's obsession was likely fueled by his romantic relationship with Gwendolen, and that they worked together to try to uncover the secret meaning.

        "section_summary": "The narrator reflects on a conversation with a man whose wife had knowledge of a secret about Hugh Vereker, but had not shared it with her husband. The narrator reveals to the man that his wife had told him about the secret, causing the man to become pale and distraught. The narrator then shares the story of how he discovered the secret, and the man listens with deepening attention, revealing that he would have been worthy of his wife's trust. The man's initial shock gives way to waves of wonder and curiosity, and the narrator notes that they are now both driven by an unappeased desire to uncover the truth. The narrator finds some consolation in the man's similar state of obsession, almost seeing it as a form of revenge."
