The villagers claimed to have originated from a city in the west over a thousand years ago and had a distinct language and culture. The team visited the village temple, which was small and poorly maintained, and met with the lamas who lived there and earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood. The Sarö Yögur people had a unique culture and language, but their history and traditions were not well-documented, and the team was unable to gather much information about their past."
