Section section_02 (Chars 8257–16549):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife Stella attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but they ended up on a wild goose chase through the streets. Eventually, the man led them to his home, where he and his wife disappeared inside, leaving the couple exhausted and dogless. Later that evening, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy that had been thrown into a pond with a brick tied to it. They took the puppy in and spent several days deciding on a name, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Excal for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a unique and humble-minded companion, with a rather unusual appearance.
