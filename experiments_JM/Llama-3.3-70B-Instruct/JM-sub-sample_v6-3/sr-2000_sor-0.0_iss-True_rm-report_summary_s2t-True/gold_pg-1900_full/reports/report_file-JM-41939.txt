Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's friend Nathalie provided emotional support and managed her daily life, allowing Rosa to focus on her art.

Section section_05 (Chars 33641–42101):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur visited the Court and was treated with great honor, having conversations with the Emperor and Empress, and taking a gondola ride on the lake with the Empress and the Prince Imperial. She later sent ten of her works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a second-class medal and was met with coldness from the judges and critics, who resented her long absence from France and her focus on English patrons.

After retiring from the school, she settled at her chateau in By, where she worked tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers, producing many notable works. During the war of 1870, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity, refusing favors from the Prussian invaders and instead aiding the suffering peasants around her.
