Section section_06 (Chars 42485–51244):
Section Summary: The author was drawn to printing on Strathmore papers and using Caslon types, which led to a surge in business and the need for more space and equipment.

The author then moved to New York, where he attempted to start a new magazine and sought out the popular writer Richard Harding Davis to contribute a story. Davis agreed to write a story without expecting payment, instead wishing the author good luck and telling him to send payment when he was able. The author was overjoyed by Davis's kindness and generosity, which gave him a much-needed boost of confidence and enthusiasm.

Section section_09 (Chars 68911–77585):
Section Summary: The author, Will Bradley, was recalled from retirement to improve the printing of illustrations in Chicago, but he believed the issue lay in the New York art departments. He submitted a report suggesting that illustrators simplify their work and focus on dramatic storytelling, but it was deemed too radical. Bradley later applied these suggestions to a new layout for McClure's magazine, which impressed the editor, but unfortunately, Mr. Hearst was not present to see it. The author reflects on the current state of design and printing, noting that young designers and printers have greater opportunities today due to advances in technology and typographic consciousness. He also looks back on his own career, which spanned many years and included numerous achievements, earning him the title of "Dean of American Designers."
