To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the devastating aftermath of war, including mass graves and cemeteries."

Mme. d'Haussonville's organization, Le Bienêtre du Blessé, collects donations to supply these hospitals with necessary food items. The lack of a private kitchen can be particularly challenging when patients are brought in outside of regular kitchen hours, but with private supplies, nurses can quickly prepare nourishing food to help save lives. Overall, the military hospitals are well-run and clean, but the addition of a supplementary kitchen with donated food items can greatly improve the care and recovery of wounded soldiers."

The hospital was well-organized and clean, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the wards and boost the morale of the wounded soldiers. The author was struck by the dedication and hard work of the women from the noblesse and haute bourgeoisie who were volunteering at the hospital. Many of these women, despite being from wealthy families, were struggling financially due to the war and were relying on donations from others to support their relief work. The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the relief efforts, highlighting the gratitude and appreciation of the French people for American generosity."
