Section Summary: Paolo Veronese, born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, was a great painter known for his unique blend of absurdity and adorability. He was trained by his uncle, Antonio Badile, and developed his skills through diligent practice, including copying the engravings of masters like Albert Durer. Veronese's early works already showed promise, and he quickly gained recognition in Verona and beyond, including a commission from Cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga to paint a picture for the cathedral at Mantua. He eventually outgrew the limited opportunities in Verona and moved to other cities, including Venice, which would become a major inspiration for his work. Veronese's love for Venice and its vibrant culture is reflected in his paintings, which are characterized by their magnificent color, splendor, and joy.
