He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation, which has left him feeling hurt and enraged. Jim is torn between his desire to be with Anne and his passion for prospecting, but he is currently struggling to make ends meet. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too broke. Despite his struggles, Jim holds onto the hope of finding gold and being with Anne, and he is reluctant to give up on his dreams."

Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him from a nearby herd. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim prepares to ride. Before leaving, Bud tells Jim about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but only got $10 and a warning from Bud. Jim and Bud then set off together, with Jim riding the burro, until they reach a fork in the trail."
