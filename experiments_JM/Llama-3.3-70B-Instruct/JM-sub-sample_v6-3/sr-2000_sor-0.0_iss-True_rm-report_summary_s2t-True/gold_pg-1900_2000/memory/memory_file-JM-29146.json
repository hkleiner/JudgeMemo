Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when Englander gets back on his feet. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi."

Englander is grateful and promises to use the money wisely, while Ramsey heads out to a gambling hall, hoping to have a lucky night. However, his luck is bad, and he soon finds himself with only three credits left. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, dressed in flashy jewelry, starts a confrontation with Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The situation becomes tense, with the Irwadian ordering Ramsey to leave the gambling hall."
