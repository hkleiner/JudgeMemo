        "section_summary": "By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy called for a two-pronged attack, with General Ulysses S. Grant leading the effort against Richmond and Petersburg, while General William T. Sherman marched towards Atlanta. Grant's army clashed with Confederate forces in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately failed to capture Richmond. The campaign then shifted to Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub and supply center for the Confederacy, which Grant sought to capture in order to isolate and force the surrender of Richmond."

        "section_summary": "Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" was constructed around Petersburg, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line had weaknesses and required more troops to defend it than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps, commanded by General Smith, being the first to arrive on the scene, outnumbering the Confederate forces led by General Beauregard."
