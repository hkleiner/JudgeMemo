Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits this street with her grandmother, Madame Yen, and other relatives to select jewels for her dowry. At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a reputable dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered a selection of precious stones, including pearls, which Madame Yen and Kuei Ping prefer. The two women carefully select the most beautiful pearls, and after a game of bargaining, they finalize their purchase. The experience is a memorable one for Kuei Ping, who later reflects on the care and expertise that went into selecting the perfect jewels."
