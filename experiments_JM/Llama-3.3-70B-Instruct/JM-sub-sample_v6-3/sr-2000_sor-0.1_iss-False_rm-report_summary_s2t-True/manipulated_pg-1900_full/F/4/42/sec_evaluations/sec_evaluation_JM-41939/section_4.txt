Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Rosa Bonheur have no chance to rested" should be "Rosa Bonheur had no chance to rest"
- [SPELLING] "mighted" is not a word, likely meant "might be"
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from describing Rosa Bonheur's menagerie to discussing her reputation and artistic style
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is not always chronological, which can be confusing
- [CLARITY] Some transitions between ideas are unclear or missing
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
