- [SYNTAX] "It always happened that I turned away with a settled conviction from these unpeopled expanses, which seemed to complete each other geographically and to symbolise together Drayton Deaneâ€™s want of voice, want of form" is a complex sentence with unclear meaning
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrator's thoughts and feelings jump abruptly between different topics
