Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "to have take" should be "to have taken"
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded" is not a word, likely meant "should be"
- [GRAMMAR] "I must left" should be "I must leave"
- [GRAMMAR] "we have not by any means done with the former when we turn from the First Part to the Second" is a long and awkward sentence
- [LEXICON] "sonorous formula" may be unclear to some readers
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between discussing Spencer's philosophy and criticizing it
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear and consistent structure
- [CLARITY] Some paragraphs seem disconnected from the rest of the text
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt
