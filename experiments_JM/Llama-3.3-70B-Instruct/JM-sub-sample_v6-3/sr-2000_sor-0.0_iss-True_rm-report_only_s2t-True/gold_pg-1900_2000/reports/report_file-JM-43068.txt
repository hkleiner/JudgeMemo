Millet's unique style and technique, which emphasize subtlety and restraint, may not be fully appreciated without an understanding of the country and landscape he painted. Overall, Millet's work is a testament to his ability to convey the beauty and dignity of peasant life, and his influence can be seen as a direct lineal descendant of the great Brueghel.

Section section_02 (Chars 8843–12746):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces.

His work reveals a philosophical mind that grappled with the problems of life, and his interest in the everyday lives of peasants is evident in his paintings, drawings, and etchings. Overall, Millet's art is marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep understanding of the human experience.
