Section section_05 (Chars 33485–42245):
Section Summary: The author developed a love for Caslon typeface and Old English Text, known as Caslon Black, during his early days as a printer.

Section section_06 (Chars 42245–50921):

However, the author soon found himself overwhelmed and struggling to manage the business, leading to a breakdown and the eventual closure of the Wayside Press.
