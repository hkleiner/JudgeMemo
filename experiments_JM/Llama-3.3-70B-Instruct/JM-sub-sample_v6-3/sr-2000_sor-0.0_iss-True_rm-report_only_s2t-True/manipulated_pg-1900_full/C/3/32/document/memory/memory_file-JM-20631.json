Davis's work helped to revitalize the Hebrew language, which had been preserved as a ritual language but was not commonly spoken. The concept of a \"Chosen People\" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. The idea of special election is not unique to Judaism, as other groups, such as the Germans, have also developed similar doctrines. The section sets the stage for a discussion on the concept of a \"Chosen People\" and its implications, highlighting the complexities and controversies surrounding this idea."

The biblical figures of Abraham, Moses, and others demonstrate a tradition of free thought and criticism of God's actions, emphasizing the importance of reason and conscience. Judaism's universal implications are evident in its acceptance of proselytes and its emphasis on the shared humanity of all people, regardless of race or nationality.

In fact, the Jewish tradition has a long history of proselytizing and accepting converts, with many non-Jews contributing to Jewish literature and culture.

The growth of the British Empire was driven by a mix of economic, strategic, and ideological factors, including a sense of divine mission and a desire for expansion. As the Empire expanded, British writers and poets began to spiritualize the doctrine of the Chosen People, presenting Britain as a nation with a noble and universal purpose. This narrative of British exceptionalism has continued to evolve, with poets like Kipling and others contributing to a legend of Britain's destined role as a global leader."

The idea of a chosen people or a national mission is not unique to Judaism, but can be seen in other cultures, such as Japan, where the individual is subordinated to the state. In contrast to its current militaristic ideology, Germany's mission was once proclaimed to be one of peace and righteousness, as expressed by Fichte and Hegel. However, the country's industrial transformation and pursuit of power have perverted its ideals, leading to a philosophy of the \"Will-to-Power\" that glorifies war and aggression. The author argues that Germanism is not synonymous with Judaism, but rather has analogies with other militaristic nations, and that its current ideology is a threat to civilization."

        "section_summary": "The author compares the German national anthem with a Jewish prayer, highlighting the difference between Germanism and Judaism. While German writers often glorify their nation, Jewish writers tend to rebuke theirs, seeking truth rather than heroics. The author notes that Jewish literature exposes the flaws of its own heroes, demonstrating a passion for veracity that is unique among nations. In contrast, German literature often glosses over the nation's flaws, and it is often Jewish critics, such as Maximilian Harden, who speak out against German militarism and nationalism. The author suggests that Judaism has a valuable contribution to make to the world, particularly in its emphasis on universalism and its potential to inspire a new era of peace and cooperation."

        "section_summary": "The speaker reflects on a quote from Lincoln about joining a church that values loving God and one's neighbor, and wonders what has been lacking in the Jewish community. The Jewish people have been silent for too long and must now choose to take action and make their voice heard. The speaker believes that Jews must fight for their own cause and work towards building a better world, as expressed in the poem by Nina Salaman. In the afterword, Dr. Israel Abrahams pays tribute to the memory of Arthur Davis, a scholar who was self-taught but had a great capacity for comradeship in studies. Davis' legacy lives on through his work, particularly his edition of the Festival Prayers, and through his daughters who continue his work."
