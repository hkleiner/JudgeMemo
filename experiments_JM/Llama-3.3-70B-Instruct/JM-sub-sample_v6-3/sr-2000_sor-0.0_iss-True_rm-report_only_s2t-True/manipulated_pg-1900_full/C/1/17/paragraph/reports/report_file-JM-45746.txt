The narrator believes that this experience illustrates the importance of treating staff as coworkers rather than subordinates. A survey of teachers revealed that they value assistance with exceptional children, interpretation of the course of study, and professional leadership from their principals. The principals can help teachers by providing support and resources, such as intelligence tests to classify pupils according to their ability, and by interpreting the course of study to ensure effective implementation.

Section section_08 (Chars 64940–70610):
Section Summary: Many high school students today are only able to pursue subjects that will prepare them for industrial or commercial occupations, and schools must provide relevant courses to prevent them from dropping out. The adjustment of students to proper vocations is a significant problem, and schools are responding by offering vocational guidance, trade schools, and part-time schools. To address this issue, schools are studying local industrial and commercial conditions and offering special subjects and courses to prepare students for various vocations. Some schools are also using club organizations and guest speakers to provide students with information about different professions and help them make informed decisions. By making these efforts, schools aim to give each student a chance to adjust to a vocation and succeed in life.
