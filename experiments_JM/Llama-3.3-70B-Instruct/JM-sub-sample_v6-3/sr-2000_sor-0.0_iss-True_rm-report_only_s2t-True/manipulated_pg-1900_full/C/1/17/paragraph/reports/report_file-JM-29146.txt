Section section_01 (Chars 0–8081):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially and has a family to support. Englander is worried about his future and that of his family, but Ramsey tries to reassure him by claiming he has some savings to fall back on. The situation is dire, with the Irwadian government seeking to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal, and only allowing Irwadian pilots to operate.

Section section_02 (Chars 8082–16018):
Section Summary: Ramsey lends 375 credits to his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and tells him to pay him back whenever he can. Later, Ramsey visits a gambling hall in the Old Quarter of Irwadi, where he encounters a drunk and arrogant Irwadian named Garr Symm, who is the new head of the Security Police. Symm, who is hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen, insults Ramsey and tells him to leave, eventually sloshing a drink in his face. Ramsey, aware that he is in a precarious situation, chooses not to react aggressively, despite being insulted. The encounter highlights the tensions between Earthmen and Irwadians, with the latter resenting the former's economic and military power in the galaxy.

The Earthgirl, who is provocatively dressed, seems to know Ramsey and can read his mind, leaving him with limited options. Ramsey and the Vegan girl are now in a precarious situation, with Symm likely to come after them and the Earthgirl's intentions unclear.

Ramsey agrees, on the condition that a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After spending the night in Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has disappeared, leaving them locked in. Ramsey searches the apartment, finding it furnished in a feminine style, but discovers no evidence of Margot's acting career on Irwadi.

Section section_05 (Chars 31945–40358):
Section Summary: Ramsey found a letter in Margot Dennison's apartment that seemed important to her, and as he read it, he discovered that it was from her father, who was dying of cancer. The letter spoke of a "proto-man" and a hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth, which could hold the key to immense power and influence in the galaxy. Margot's father had been searching for this secret and wanted Margot to continue his work, but warned her that presenting the information to scientists would be met with laughter and disbelief. Ramsey was perplexed by the letter and its references to proto-man and hyper-space, and he was soon joined by Margot, who had returned to the apartment. The two of them were on the run, with a wanted bulletin issued for their arrest, and they began working on a ship in a nearby Spacer Graveyard, planning to make their escape.

Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are working on a 50-year-old Canopusian freighter in the Spacer Graveyard, trying to repair it to escape. Margot, who can read minds, senses that they are being watched, and Ramsey is anxious, trying to hide his thoughts and feelings from her. Meanwhile, Security Officer Ramar Chind reports to his boss, Garr Symm, who wants to let the trio escape so they can be followed, as they may lead them to something of immense importance found in Margot's apartment. Symm orders Chind to plant a fuel supply, U-235 capsules, in one of the wrecks to aid their escape. The true purpose of their mission and the significance of the item found in Margot's apartment remain unclear, but Symm believes it can secure Irwadi's dominance in the galaxy.

The ship lands, but the environment outside is hostile, with extreme cold and no atmosphere, making it impossible for Margot to explore without a spacesuit.

Section section_09 (Chars 64904–72912):

However, Ramsey eventually agrees to go with them, and they exit the ship, hearing a beautiful, un-Earthly music that seems to be the "Music of the Spheres". As they stand outside, the fog begins to clear, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot identifies as a matter transmitter, a device that could enable instantaneous travel across space. The group stands in awe, waiting to see what will happen next as the device begins to open.
