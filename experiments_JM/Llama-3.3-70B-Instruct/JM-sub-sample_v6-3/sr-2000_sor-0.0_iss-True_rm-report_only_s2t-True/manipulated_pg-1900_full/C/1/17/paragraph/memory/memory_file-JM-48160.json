To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber scenery."

Along the way, they were frequently stopped by sentinels who examined their papers, but the narrator was able to observe the war zone up close, seeing soldiers, artillery, and camions. The narrator noted that many soldiers seemed to be loafing, waiting to be called to the front, and that the roads were surprisingly well-maintained despite the heavy traffic. The trip provided the narrator with a unique perspective on the war zone, one that was different from what they would have seen by train."

The narrator then shifts to discussing a new organization, \"Le Bienêtre du Blessé,\" a French-American society aimed at providing comfort and care to wounded soldiers. The organization, led by Mme. d'Andigné, aims to provide a more varied diet for convalescent soldiers, as the standard military hospital diet of milk and eggs is often not sufficient.

The author visited several hospitals in the war zone, including the Hôpital Central, and witnessed the dedication of the nurses and the impact of the supplementary supplies on the soldiers' well-being.
