Section section_02 (Chars 8701–17403):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's art is characterized by his ability to convey a message, which sets him apart from other painters who may focus solely on technique. To fully appreciate his work, one must be familiar with the countryside he depicted, as the subtleties of atmosphere and line are unique to each region.

Section section_03 (Chars 17404–26366):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged landscape and harsh weather conditions shaping his perspective. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a contemplative disposition, which was encouraged by his family, particularly his father, who recognized his artistic talent. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family supported his artistic pursuits, eventually leading him to meet with a painter in Cherbourg to showcase his work. This marked the beginning of Millet's journey towards becoming a prominent figure in the modern naturalistic school of art.

Section section_04 (Chars 26367–35207):
Section Summary: Millet's artistic talent was recognized by Mouchel, who introduced him to the works of great artists through engravings. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his passion for art led him to eventually return to Cherbourg and study under M. Langlois, a classically trained artist. Langlois, although unable to appreciate Millet's unique style, helped him secure a pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of masters like Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin. In Paris, Millet briefly studied under Delaroche, but found his academic style stifling and eventually struck out on his own, struggling to make a living from his art. Despite the challenges, Millet was determined to develop his own unique style and work towards recognition as an artist.

Section section_05 (Chars 35208–43969):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet struggled to make a living as a painter, often earning very little for his work and relying on the kindness of friends to get by. He eventually found success and a sense of community in Barbizon, where he settled and focused on depicting the lives of peasants. Millet's art was driven by his fascination with the daily struggles and joys of rural life, and he found inspiration in the people and landscapes around him. In contrast to his fellow artist Rousseau, who preferred to paint landscapes and solitude, Millet was drawn to the human aspect of rural life and the stories of the people who worked the land. By living a simple life among the peasants he painted, Millet was able to tap into his creative powers and produce some of his most notable works.
