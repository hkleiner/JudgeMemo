Despite various Union generals' attempts to capture Richmond, the war remained unresolved, with Confederate General Lee successfully defending the city. In 1864, Union General Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to lead the Union armies and devised a two-pronged attack, with General William T. Sherman targeting the Confederate Army of Tennessee and Grant focusing on Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Grant's campaign began with a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but ultimately shifted to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for Richmond. The siege of Petersburg marked a turning point in the war, as Grant's strategy aimed to isolate Richmond and wear down Lee's army, ultimately leading to the city's fall."

The city's capture would have severely impacted the Confederacy's ability to supply its troops, making it a key target for Union forces. In June 1864, Union troops under General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the city's defenses, known as the Dimmock Line. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederate troops under General Beauregard put up a strong defense, but were eventually forced to withdraw to new positions closer to the city. The Union forces continued to attack, but were unable to break through the Confederate lines, leading to a prolonged siege of the city."

Despite some setbacks, including the Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road, the Union army extended its lines and prepared for a long-term siege. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including coal miners from the 48th Pennsylvania Regiment, proposed a plan to dig a mine under the Confederate lines and blow it up, which was approved by General Grant. The Union army began digging the mine on June 25, using improvised tools and equipment, with the goal of breaking through the Confederate defenses and capturing Petersburg."

On July 30, the tunnel was filled with 8,000 pounds of black powder, which was detonated at 4:40 a.m., killing or wounding at least 278 Confederate troops. The explosion was followed by a Union charge, but the attack was disorganized and the Confederates were able to rally and prevent a breakthrough.
