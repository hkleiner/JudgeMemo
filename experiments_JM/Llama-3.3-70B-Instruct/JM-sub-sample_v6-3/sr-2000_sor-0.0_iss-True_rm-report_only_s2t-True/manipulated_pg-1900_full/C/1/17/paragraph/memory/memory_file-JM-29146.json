He tries to stop her, but Garr Symm intervenes, and despite Ramsey's efforts, Symm jumps into the box, which seems to have a profound effect on him, regressing him to a primitive state. Vardin, a proto-human, reveals that her ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, and she has been trying to prevent humans from accessing it. Ramsey and Margot escape, and as they leave the planet, Vardin disappears, having completed her mission to protect humanity from the dangers of matter-transmission. In the end, Margot and Ramsey find love for each other, and they blast off into space, leaving the mysterious events behind."

The other person responded with a rhetorical question, implying that returning to Earth might not be desirable anyway. Ramsey realized that they had a vast amount of time and space to explore together. This prospect seemed to be a positive and exciting one for her. The conversation ended on a hopeful note, with a sense of limitless possibilities ahead."
