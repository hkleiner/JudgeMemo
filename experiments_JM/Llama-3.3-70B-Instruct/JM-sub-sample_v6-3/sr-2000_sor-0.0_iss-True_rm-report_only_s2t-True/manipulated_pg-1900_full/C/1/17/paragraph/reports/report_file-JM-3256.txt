Section section_01 (Chars 0–7862):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a true bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A bookman is born, not made, and is characterized by a deep love and appreciation for books, rather than just possessing them for show or financial gain. The author illustrates this point with a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, ornate bookcase, but is not a true bookman because he keeps his books locked away behind glass doors. In contrast, a true bookman values access to and intimacy with their books, and is often drawn to rare and unique volumes. The author also touches on the idea that some books are classics, standing the test of time and offering wisdom and inspiration to readers across generations.

Section Summary: The bookman has a deep love for literature, particularly essays, and enjoys reading authors such as Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey. He values books that are well-written and bring the past to life, and is not concerned with whether the writer's views are respectable or accurate.

He returns to these favorite authors again and again, finding comfort and pleasure in their works. The bookman also admires French literature, particularly Balzac, who he considers the master of the realistic school and a founder of the art.
