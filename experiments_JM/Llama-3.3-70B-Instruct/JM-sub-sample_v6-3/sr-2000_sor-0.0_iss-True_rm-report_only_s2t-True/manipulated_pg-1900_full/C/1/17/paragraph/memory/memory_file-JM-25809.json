Jim, a prospector, is struggling to find success in the gulch, and his frustration is compounded by a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability. Anne's letter is a heartfelt expression of her love for Jim, but also her practical concerns about their future together. Jim is deeply hurt and angry by the letter, but his misery is interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who brings a welcome distraction from his troubles. As Jim interacts with Bud, his initial irritation gives way to a more positive mood, influenced by Bud's cheerful demeanor."

Upon arrival, they work efficiently to dig a relief tunnel and eventually rescue Jim, who is injured but alive.
