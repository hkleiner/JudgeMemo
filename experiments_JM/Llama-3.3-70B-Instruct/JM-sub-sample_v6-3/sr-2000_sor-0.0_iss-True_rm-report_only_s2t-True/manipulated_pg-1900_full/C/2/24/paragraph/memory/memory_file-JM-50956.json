Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy, making it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat them. Russia's contributions were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan to quickly defeat France was thwarted by Russia's diversion of German and Austrian forces. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's sacrifices and military efforts were instrumental in the Allied victory, and its role in the war should not be underestimated."

By advancing into East Prussia, Russia diverted German troops from the French front, ultimately contributing to Germany's defeat in the First Battle of the Marne. German General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to distort this fact, falsely claiming that he defeated a larger Russian force with a smaller German army. However, Ludendorf inadvertently acknowledges the significance of Russia's actions, admitting that the transfer of German troops to East Prussia had \"fatal consequences\" for Germany. Russia's sacrifices during this period were instrumental in shifting the course of the war, and their importance should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts."

The Russian Army's operations in October and November 1914, particularly at Warsaw and Galicia, forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers to the East and abandon their offensive in France. This led to a significant shift in German strategy, with Ludendorf himself acknowledging that the German front in the West was weakened, and they were compelled to focus on the Eastern front. As a result, the Germans did not launch any major offensives in France for over a year, giving the Allies a significant advantage. Russia's sacrifices and military efforts played a decisive role in shaping the course of the war, particularly during the critical periods of August-September and October-November 1914."

In 1915, Russia's single-handed fight against Germany, Austria, and Turkey allowed France and England to prepare for the war and accumulate new reserves. The Russian front drew in German reserves, preventing them from being used in France, and ultimately contributed to the failure of the German offensive at Verdun. Ludendorf's own memoirs acknowledge that the lack of reserves, which were being used up on the Russian front, hindered the German army's ability to achieve decisive results. The Russian Army's resistance in 1915 prevented the Germans from exploiting their successes, and their bravery and sacrifice helped to turn the tide of the war in favor of the Allies."

The offensive led by General Brusilov in 1916, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of prisoners and significant trophies, forced the Austrians to abandon their offensive in Italy and transfer troops to the Russian front. This, in turn, allowed the Italians to launch a counter-offensive and relieved pressure on the French front, enabling the Allies to clear the forts of Verdun of German forces. Russia's assistance to its allies continued in 1916, with the Russian Army providing support to the French during the Verdun period and later helping to defend Romania against invasion. The Russian Army's efforts ultimately weakened the German and Austro-Hungarian forces, setting the stage for a potential decisive victory in 1917."
