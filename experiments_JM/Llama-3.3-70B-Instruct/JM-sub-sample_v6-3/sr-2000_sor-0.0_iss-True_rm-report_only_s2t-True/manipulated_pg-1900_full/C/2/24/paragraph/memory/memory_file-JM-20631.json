Davis's work, including his writings on Hebrew accents and his role in editing the Festival Prayer Book, has contributed to the revival of Hebrew as a living language. The concept of a \"Chosen People\" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. This idea has been distorted and used by others, such as the Germans, to justify their own claims of superiority. The author aims to explore the concept of the \"Chosen People\" and its significance in Jewish tradition, while also addressing the criticisms and misconceptions surrounding it."

However, these passages must be considered in their historical context and interpreted in a comparative manner, taking into account the cultural and social norms of the time. The concept of a Chosen People and other biblical ideas must be understood through the lens of history and human nature, rather than being judged by modern standards. Judaism has evolved over time, incorporating spiritual and intellectual developments, and has moved beyond its more primitive stages, as reflected in the Talmud and the teachings of post-biblical thinkers and saints. Ultimately, the Bible is a complex and multifaceted text that reflects the diversity and richness of human experience, and its interpretation requires a nuanced and contextual approach."

The Old Testament's ideal is not tribal, but rather a dynamic impulse that drives civilization, with a focus on serving others and promoting the greater good. This ideal is reflected in Jewish liturgy and prayer, which emphasizes the importance of obedience to the Law and the pursuit of justice and righteousness. Ultimately, the essence of Judaism lies in an apostolic altruism, with the goal of serving the world and promoting the Kingdom of God, rather than seeking self-sufficient superiority."

The Jewish tradition also shows a strong emphasis on reason, love, and morality, with figures like Abraham, Moses, and Maimonides promoting a God of justice and compassion. The Jewish people have historically been open to proselytism and have sought to spread their message to others, with many non-Jews converting to Judaism and contributing to its development. Overall, the true nature of the Jewish God is one of universalism, justice, and love, rather than tribalism or exclusivity."

The development of a national mission can be seen in other countries, such as the United States, which has evolved from a sectarian patriotism to a universal mission of defending liberties. Similarly, England's national self-consciousness began with insular patriotism and developed into a sense of special protection and a mission to defend the liberties of mankind. The idea of a chosen people or nation is often tied to a sense of divine favor or purpose, and can be seen as a way of explaining a nation's unique character or destiny."

However, this greatness was tainted by the slave trade, poverty, and social issues at home. The concept of Britain as a \"Chosen People\" emerged, with poets like Thomson and Kipling expressing a sense of divine purpose and mission, which was often used to justify imperial expansion. This idea of a national mission was not unique to Britain, as other nations, including Israel, have also developed similar conceptions of themselves as chosen for a greater purpose. The evolution of Britain's national identity and mission is still shaping itself, influenced by its history, literature, and cultural heritage."

The idea of \"Germanism\" being equivalent to Judaism is flawed, as Germanism is more akin to the nationalistic and militaristic ideologies of other countries, such as Japan. In fact, Germany's emphasis on state power and individual sacrifice is a revival of ancient pagan constitutions, which prioritized the state over individuality. The true nature of Germany's mission has been perverted over time, particularly with the rise of industrial prosperity and the glorification of war, leading to a ruthless and conscious pursuit of power. Ultimately, Germanism's analogies are found in the militaristic and imperialistic tendencies of other maritime countries, rather than in Judaism."
