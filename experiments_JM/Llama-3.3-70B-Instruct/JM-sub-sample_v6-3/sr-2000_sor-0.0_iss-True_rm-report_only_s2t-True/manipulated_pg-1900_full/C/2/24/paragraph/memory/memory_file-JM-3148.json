Anthony, a skilled violinist, believes that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin. He asks Davy to paint a picture with words, and the boy describes the sunset and landscape in vivid detail. Anthony then plays his violin, producing a rich and harmonious sound that fills the atmosphere. The narrative also flashes back to Anthony's childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in music and the outdoors, hinting at his eventual development as a skilled musician."

However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. He had a passion for music and inventing, and spent hours taking apart and reassembling musical instruments, even creating his own unique instruments. As he grew older, Anthony's skills in repairing and restoring instruments earned him some recognition, and he was eventually trusted with valuable instruments, including a rare violin that had been hanging on a wall for decades. Through his self-directed learning and experimentation, Anthony developed a deep understanding of the world and its workings, driven by his insatiable curiosity and love for discovery."

He spent his days studying and practicing, and at the age of 17, he discovered a precious piece of wood from a historic maple tree that he vowed to use to make a perfect violin after it had completed its century of waiting. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he couldn't teach him anything new. The boy's love for music and craftsmanship was inspired by the works of Antonius Stradivarius, and he aspired to create violins that were perfect and beautiful. Through his hard work and devotion, Anthony aimed to create instruments that would bring joy and harmony to those who played them."

She was now 40 years old, but still felt young and sensitive, with a deep emotional life. As she settled into her new home, Lyddy had few visitors, and the community was still getting used to the fact that she was living in the cottage, which had previously been her aunt's home."
