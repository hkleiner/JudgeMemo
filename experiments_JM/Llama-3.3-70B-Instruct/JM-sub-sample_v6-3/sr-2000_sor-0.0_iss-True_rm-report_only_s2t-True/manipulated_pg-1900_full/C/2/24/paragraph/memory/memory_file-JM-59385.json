Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits this street with her grandmother, Madame Yen, and other relatives to purchase jewels for her dowry. At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a reputable dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered tea, and then begin the process of selecting and bargaining for the finest pearls. Madame Yen and Wong Lui engage in a skilled game of negotiation, with Kuei Ping eventually gathering a handful of pearls and feeling a deep connection to their beauty.
