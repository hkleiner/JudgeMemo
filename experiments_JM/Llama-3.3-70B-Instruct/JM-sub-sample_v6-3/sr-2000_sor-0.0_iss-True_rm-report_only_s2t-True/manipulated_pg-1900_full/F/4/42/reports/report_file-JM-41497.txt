Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a successful portrait painter who enjoyed the patronage of high society and raised his prices as his reputation grew. He was a man of many interests and friendships, including with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke, which helped to refine his mind and tastes.

Section section_03 (Chars 17596–26336):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds was a renowned painter who had already achieved great success by 1769, having painted many famous men and women of his time. He was a member of the Dilettanti Society and had a wide circle of friends, including Dr. Johnson, with whom he traveled to Devonshire. Reynolds' studio in Leicester Square was a hub of activity, with a diverse range of sitters, including royalty, politicians, and actors, all seeking to be immortalized by his brush. Despite his success, Reynolds' paintings were not without their flaws, with many of his early works darkening and his later works fading due to his use of experimental pigments. Overall, Reynolds left a glorious heritage to his country, but his failure to master permanent coloring is a regrettable aspect of his legacy.

Section section_04 (Chars 26337–34988):
Section Summary: After being knighted in 1769, Sir Joshua Reynolds' social status increased, and he began to paint fewer portraits, focusing on his other duties and enjoying the finer things in life. He continued to produce high-quality work, and his Discourses remained popular, with new editions still being published. Reynolds traveled to the Low Countries, visiting cities like Bruges and Amsterdam, and showed appreciation for the art he saw, although he was surprisingly indifferent to the works of Franz Hals. In the late 1780s, Reynolds' health began to decline, and he suffered a sudden loss of vision in one eye in 1789, forcing him to stop painting. Despite his declining health, Reynolds had already established himself as a renowned artist, leaving behind a legacy of remarkable portraits and a record of unrelenting productivity.

Section section_05 (Chars 34989–43596):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds spent his final years preparing for his death, sustained by memories of the past and surrounded by friends. He delivered his final address to students in 1790 and sat for a portrait by the Swedish artist von Breda, before passing away in 1792 at the age of 68. Reynolds' art continued to evolve throughout his life, and he is considered one of the greatest portrait painters of all time, able to hold his own against other masters. He was a skilled assimilator, drawing inspiration from various artists, including Rembrandt, Titian, and Michelangelo, and synthesizing their styles to create his own unique approach. Reynolds' portraits often prioritized beauty and elegance over humanity, particularly in his depictions of women and children, which were often idealized and classical in style.

Section section_06 (Chars 43597–47061):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings of women and children lack a sense of intimacy, suggesting he had no deep interest in them. In contrast, his portraits of men, such as Admiral Keppel and Charles James Fox, showcase his exceptional skill and ability to capture their character and essence. Reynolds' paintings of men are masterful, conveying their subjects' personalities and traits with simplicity and directness. However, many of his canvases have not aged well, with some losing their original colors or being restored, which can make it difficult to appreciate his work at its best. Despite this, Reynolds' reputation as a great artist remains, and his name is still revered in the art world.
