1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded" instead of "would"
- [SPELLING] "Trevisano" might be a typo, but without context, it's hard to determine
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Veronese's trip to Rome to his return to Venice
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter divisions seem arbitrary and don't always follow a logical narrative flow
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making them difficult to understand
