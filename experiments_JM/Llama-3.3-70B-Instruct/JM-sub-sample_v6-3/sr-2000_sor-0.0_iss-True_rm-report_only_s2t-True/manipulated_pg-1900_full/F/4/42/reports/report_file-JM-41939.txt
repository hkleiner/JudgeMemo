Section section_01 (Chars 0–8524):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a drawing master and her mother Sophie Marquis a music teacher. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After trying various occupations, including dressmaking and school, Rosa's father allowed her to focus on art, and she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which showed promise of her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to art, spending hours copying the works of great masters at the Louvre and embarking on a path to become a renowned artist.

Section section_03 (Chars 16954–25348):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's friend Nathalie provided her with emotional support and helped with her daily needs, allowing her to focus on her art. Despite her success, Rosa continued to study and research, often visiting slaughterhouses and later, horse fairs, to observe and sketch animals. Her hard work paid off with the creation of masterpieces like "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", which brought her widespread recognition and financial success. "The Horse Fair" was eventually sold to an American collector and later donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while a reduced replica was bequeathed to the National Gallery. Rosa's success enabled her to build a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which she designed to suit her needs and filled with her artwork and a courtyard that she transformed into a farm.

Bonheur's success continued to grow, and in 1865, she was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the Empress herself.

Section section_05 (Chars 33627–42083):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur visited the Court and had a pleasant experience, discussing the intelligence of animals with the Emperor and going on an excursion with the Empress. However, her participation in the Universal Exposition of 1867 was met with coldness from the judges and critics, who resented her long absence from France and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, where she was a demanding but kind teacher, and many of her students went on to have successful careers. After retiring from teaching, she devoted herself to her art, working tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers and producing many notable works. During the war of 1870, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity by aiding the suffering peasants and refusing to accept favors from the Prussian invaders.
