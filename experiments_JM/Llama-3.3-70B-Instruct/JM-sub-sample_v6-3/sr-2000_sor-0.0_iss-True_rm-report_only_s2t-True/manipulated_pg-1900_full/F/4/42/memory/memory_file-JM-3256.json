        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point through anecdotes, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare or Milton demonstrates a natural affinity for literature, despite his lack of formal education. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting, popular books and timeless, classic literature."

The author particularly cherishes the works of Scott and Thackeray, finding their stories to be timeless and captivating, with characters like Henry Esmond and Jeanie Deans leaving a lasting impression.

The text then shifts to the bookman's love of rearranging his books, finding joy in the process of organizing and rediscovering favorite passages and authors. The author imagines a gathering of bookmen, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Mary Queen of Scots, to share their passion for books and literature. Ultimately, the section celebrates the delight of immersing oneself in a personal library, surrounded by beloved books and the beauty of nature."

The author humorously compares this obsession to dipsomania, or alcoholism, with the bookman's wife often suffering as a result of his habits. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to make sacrifices and even practice deceit in order to obtain the books he desires."
