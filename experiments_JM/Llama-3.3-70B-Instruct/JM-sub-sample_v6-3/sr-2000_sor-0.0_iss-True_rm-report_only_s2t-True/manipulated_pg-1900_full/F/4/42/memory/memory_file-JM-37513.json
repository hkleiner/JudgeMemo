Spencer's philosophy of evolution, which emphasizes the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous through successive differentiations, had a profound impact on the author. The author notes that Spencer's ideas, although influential, were limited by his narrow focus on biological relationships, which led him to overlook other important relationships. Despite this limitation, Spencer's work was groundbreaking and original, and his contributions to biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics are still recognized today. The author credits Spencer with providing a framework for understanding the complexity of the universe and the interconnectedness of all things."

His concept of the Unknowable, or the Ultimate Reality, is a central idea in his philosophy, referring to the unknown source or power that drives all phenomena. Spencer's distinction between the knowable effects of natural phenomena and their Unknowable Cause or Source is a key aspect of his philosophical thought."

Bergson, and how this relates to the philosophies of Herbert Spencer and Bergson. Both Spencer and Bergson believe that the ultimate source of evolution is unknowable by the intellect, with Spencer referring to it as the \"Unknowable\" and Bergson calling it \"Life\". The two philosophers differ in their approach to understanding the world, with Spencer using intellectual symbolism and Bergson advocating for a more intuitive approach. Spencer's philosophy of science emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, but his treatment of cause and effect is often puzzling and ambiguous. Ultimately, both philosophers seek to understand the source of phenomena, with Spencer's thought constantly underlying the notion of a noumenal source of power that works changes."

Clifford, who argued that an exact knowledge of facts can supersede the need to inquire about their causes. In science, relatedness and change are key concepts, and simple types of relatedness, such as gravitation, can be expressed in formulae that describe the rate of change. The idea of energy as an active agent that produces change is also misleading, and energy is better understood as a constant ratio of variables that describes the changes themselves. The concept of force can be redefined as a measure of change or the degree of relatedness, rather than an active cause. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the meaning of these concepts and remove ambiguity in scientific interpretation."

These relationships are not just abstract concepts, but are as real as the things they relate, and should be taken into account in scientific formulas. As evolution progresses, new and more complex relationships emerge, leading to the appearance of new properties that are not simply the sum of their parts. The author suggests that these new properties are constitutive, meaning they characterize the higher evolutionary products, and that science may one day be able to establish correlations between different types of processes, such as cognitive, physiological, and physico-chemical. Ultimately, the author argues that evolution is a process of increasing complexity and relatedness, leading to the emergence of new properties and relationships that cannot be reduced to simpler components."

Herbert Spencer's philosophy of science has undergone changes, including a recognition of specific vital characters in living organisms that cannot be conceived in physico-chemical terms. Spencer's view on cognitive relation emphasizes that knowledge involves a relationship between the organism and the environment, and that cognition is a complex network of relatedness. However, his terminology and analysis of cognitive relatedness have been criticized for being ambiguous and perplexing. Ultimately, a scientific interpretation of cognitive relatedness must be dealt with on lines strictly analogous to those of other relational problems, without relying on non-scientific entities or concepts."
