Section section_01 (Chars 0–8134):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point through anecdotes, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare or Milton demonstrates a natural affinity for literature, despite his lack of formal education. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting, popular books and timeless, classic literature.

Section section_05 (Chars 32650–40845):
Section Summary: The author describes the allure of books and how they can captivate people, even across centuries. The love of books can be hereditary, with a father's passion for reading and collecting books often passed down to his son. A book collector, or "bookman," can become so enamored with books that it becomes an obsession, similar to a disease, and can lead to financial and personal sacrifices. The author humorously compares this obsession to dipsomania, or alcoholism, with the bookman's wife often suffering as a result of his habits. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to make sacrifices and even practice deceit in order to obtain the books he desires.
