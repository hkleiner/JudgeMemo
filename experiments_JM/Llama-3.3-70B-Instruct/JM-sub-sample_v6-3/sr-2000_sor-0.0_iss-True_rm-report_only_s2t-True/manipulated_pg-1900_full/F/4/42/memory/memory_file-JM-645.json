Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although Lady Jane eventually brings it up and praises the narrator's writing. The narrator is eager to impress Vereker and prove his understanding of his work, but is unsure if he has succeeded in doing so."

        "section_summary": "The narrator is anxious about the possibility of Hugh Vereker's death and the loss of the opportunity to learn the secret of his writing. After Vereker's death, the narrator waits for Drayton Deane, who has married Gwendolen Corvick, to reveal the secret, but Deane remains silent. The narrator is convinced that Deane knows the secret but is either unable or unwilling to share it, and this realization brings the narrator a sense of comfort in his own ignorance. The narrator's obsession with the secret continues even after Gwendolen's death, and he eventually confronts Deane about it in a club smoking room. Deane's response, or lack thereof, is anticipated, but the outcome is left uncertain, with Deane looking at the narrator like a \"dim phrenological bust\"."

        "section_summary": "The narrator discusses Hugh Vereker's secret, the underlying intention of his books, with a man who was married to Mrs. Deane, a woman who supposedly knew Vereker's secret. However, the man claims he has no knowledge of the secret, revealing that his wife never shared it with him. The narrator is shocked and disappointed, realizing that Mrs. Deane didn't think her husband was worthy of knowing the secret. The narrator then shares his own story of trying to uncover Vereker's secret, and the man listens with growing interest and curiosity. The two men are now united in their desire to uncover the secret, with the man's ignorance of his wife's knowledge adding to his motivation."
