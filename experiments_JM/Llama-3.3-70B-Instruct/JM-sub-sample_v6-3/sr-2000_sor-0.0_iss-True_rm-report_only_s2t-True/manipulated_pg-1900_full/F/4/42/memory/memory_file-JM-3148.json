Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his instrument. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he recalls his own childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in the outdoors and in music. Anthony's love for music was evident even as a young boy, when he would create makeshift instruments and hide a precious tuning fork outside the school window to avoid having it confiscated. The scene ends with Anthony playing his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony and beauty."

However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. Tony's passion for learning and discovery led him to develop a keen interest in music and instrument-making, and he spent hours taking apart and reassembling instruments to understand how they worked. As he grew older, Tony's skills improved, and he began to earn a little money by repairing instruments for the villagers, although they often undervalued his work. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony's mother loved and supported him, even if she didn't always understand his eccentricities."

Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins. At the age of 17, he discovered a precious piece of wood from a historic maple tree, which he set aside to use for making a perfect violin in the future. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. As Anthony delved deeper into his craft, he became inspired by the poetry of Antonio Stradivari, which emphasized the importance of perfection, temperance, and attention to detail in creating beautiful music and instruments."

Lyddy had a troubled past, having been disfigured in a childhood accident and subsequently kept out of sight by her mother, leading to a life of solitude and introversion. As a result, she had few visitors in her first month in Edgewood, and the community was still getting used to her presence. Aunt Hitty, however, was already disapproving of Lyddy's actions, particularly her decision to remove the silver coffin-plates that her aunt had displayed."

Lyddy, who has never known love before, is overjoyed and accepts his proposal. The two are now married and sitting in an apple orchard, where Anthony is composing music using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs, and Lyddy is sewing and dreaming of their future together. As Anthony plays his violin, Lyddy and their nephew Davy interpret the music as a reflection of the beauty and promise of their lives, filled with love, hope, and new beginnings."
