        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday life. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" convey a sense of melancholy and truth, and are not sentimental as some critics have suggested. His unique style, influenced by the Italian Renaissance and his own gentle disposition, sets him apart from his contemporaries. Millet's paintings are a testament to his ability to convey the struggles and sorrows of the simple folk, and his work continues to be appreciated for its intense earnestness and melancholy truth."

His paintings, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", highlight the loneliness and monotony of peasant labor, while also emphasizing the importance of their work. Millet's art is characterized by restraint and a focus on illustrating the human condition, rather than displaying brilliant technique or color. He was inspired by the simplicity and beauty of rural life, particularly in the spring season, and his paintings often feature peasants engaged in everyday activities. Overall, Millet's art is a reflection of his philosophical observations on life, and his brush is a means to convey these thoughts and ideas."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art. His childhood was marked by a strong connection to nature and a simple, hardworking lifestyle, which would later influence his artistic style. Millet's early life was shaped by his family, particularly his grandmother and a vicar who introduced him to literature and encouraged his curiosity. He developed a passion for drawing and literature, laying the foundation for his future career as a pioneering naturalistic artist."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a significant influence on his style. Millet briefly studied with Delaroche, but found his academic approach stifling and eventually stopped attending his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties. Freed from these constraints, Millet was now able to develop his own unique style and work towards establishing himself as an artist."

He was part of a community of artists, including Rousseau, who shared his love for art but had different approaches and inspirations. Despite facing many challenges, Millet persevered and continued to create art that reflected his unique perspective and style."

However, his health began to decline due to a persistent cough, and he eventually passed away on January 20, 1875. Millet's art is characterized by his passionate sympathy with the struggles of the common people, particularly peasants, and his works often convey a sense of sadness and melancholy. Despite facing numerous challenges and criticisms during his lifetime, Millet's influence on the art world has been profound, inspiring many artists, including Segantini, with his sincere and profound style. His legacy continues to be felt, with his works remaining a powerful expression of the human experience."
