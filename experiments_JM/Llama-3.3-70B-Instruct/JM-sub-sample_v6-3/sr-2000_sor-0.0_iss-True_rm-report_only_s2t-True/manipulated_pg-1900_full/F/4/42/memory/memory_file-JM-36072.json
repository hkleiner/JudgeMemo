The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a stable equilibrium, where the masses had no voice in government but had a stake in the country. The aristocracy held political power and were highly cultivated, enlightened patrons of literature and art. The French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a period of isolation for England, which became more disconnected from European thought and instead turned to Germany for inspiration."

However, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and overpopulation being major issues, as highlighted by writers like Byron and Disraeli. The early 19th century saw a stark contrast between the rich and the poor, with the governing class showing little interest in the lives of the poor. Despite the progress and advancements made during this time, social critics like Carlyle and Ruskin emerged, denouncing the age for its materialism, ugliness, and social injustices. They advocated for a return to simpler social structures and a focus on beauty, morality, and equality, with Ruskin seeing the Industrial Revolution as a \"gigantic blunder\" that needed to be reversed."

The period saw significant improvements in various areas, including the law, universities, and civil service, which were previously plagued by inefficiencies and abuses. The army, however, was in a state of disarray, with poor discipline, brutal treatment of soldiers, and incompetence in military leadership. Despite these challenges, the reign saw unprecedented progress in many areas, including finance, education, and science, leading to a sense of optimism and good governance. Overall, while there were still issues in foreign politics, the period from 1832 to 1867 is considered a time of significant improvement in internal affairs."

The settlement after 1815 led to the restoration of despotic governments in Europe, and England's influence on the continent was limited. The Victorian Age was a time of great prosperity for England, but it was due to temporary advantages that have since passed, and the country must now compete with other nations on equal terms. The period also saw significant intellectual and literary movements, including the Romanticist revolution, which inspired great poetry and literature. The Victorian era produced many great figures, including Alfred Tennyson, who is considered one of the greatest poets of the age, and whose longevity and freshness of work have no parallel in history except in ancient Greece."

His work, such as the Idylls of the King, was an allegory that explored themes of ideal manhood and the struggle between sense and soul. Tennyson's poetry reflected his age, with its mix of conservatism and liberalism, and he was concerned about the social and political upheavals of his time, foreseeing many of the evils that would come to pass. He represented the Victorian mood in religion, which was characterized by a distinctively Victorian attitude towards faith, with many intellectuals embracing doubt and questioning traditional dogma. Overall, Tennyson's work continues to offer insights into the human condition, and his poetry remains relevant despite the passing of time."

The era's greatness was due to a combination of transient circumstances, and its decline was marked by the disintegration of society and the rise of antagonistic movements. The fusion of social classes and the growth of industry also had both positive and negative effects, including the creation of a new type of worker who was no longer valued for their craftsmanship. The author believes that the Victorian Age, along with the Elizabethan Age, represents a peak in English civilization, and that the country's grand-scale work on the world stage is likely coming to an end. Ultimately, the author suggests that the future of England depends on the actions of the younger generation, who will shape the country's destiny in the years to come."
