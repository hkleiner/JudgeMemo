Section section_04 (Chars 26454–35255):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's father took him to Cherbourg to show his drawings to a local painter, Mouchel, who was impressed by the young artist's talent. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a significant influence on his style. Millet briefly studied with Delaroche, but found his academic approach stifling and eventually stopped attending his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties. Freed from these constraints, Millet was now able to develop his own unique style and work towards establishing himself as an artist.
