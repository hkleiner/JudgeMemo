The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, and have a language that resembles Khirgis and Turkish. The village has a small, poorly used temple, and the local administration is overseen by a pykh and his assistant, with the villagers paying a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The team was able to gather some information about the tribe, but the Yögurs were hesitant to share their history, legends, and songs, possibly due to suspicion or other reasons."

The women's head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, copper rings, and metal ornaments. The Sarö Yögurs' economic condition is relatively low, with limited livestock and a simple diet of flour, tea, and occasional meat, and they appear to lack energy and enthusiasm, with no traditional sports or games.

The author later prepared to visit the \"Yellow Tanguts\" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'ang-lung-ssu, was challenging, with a difficult road and slippery ice, but they eventually arrived at the monastery, which was a collection of buildings with a large temple. The monastery, also known as Rtangu rgonba, was situated on the lower slopes of small hills and was surrounded by dozens of houses, most of which were low and unpretentious."

The lamas, who numbered only around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading services.

They rode through the valleys of Kluadjek-gol and Mör-gol, following a narrow path with steep grassy slopes, and eventually arrived at the Lansor's or Neiman-gol valley. The valley led them to the Chinese town of Li-yen, which they reached after a scenic ride along the river. The town, surrounded by hills and willow trees, was unchanged since Potanin's expedition 20 years prior, and the narrator received a warm welcome from the friendly old mandarin. The mandarin showed his hospitality by sending the narrator a delicious dinner and presenting him with five sable skins as a parting gift."
