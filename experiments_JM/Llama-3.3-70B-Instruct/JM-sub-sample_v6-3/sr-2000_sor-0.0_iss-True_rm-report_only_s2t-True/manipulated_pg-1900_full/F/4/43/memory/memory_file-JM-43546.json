Donald's father, a doctor, suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising it in the paper and giving notice at the police station, but if no one claims it, Donald can keep it. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, complete with shortbread, scones, and cakes, and discusses plans to visit Donald's uncle, Uncle Alan, for a birthday party.

        "section_summary": "The Lindsay family and their friends, the Gordons, spent a week in Glasgow, enjoying excursions and sails on the River Clyde and nearby islands. The boys, Don and Sandy, had a friendly debate about which city was finer, Glasgow or Edinburgh, with each presenting their own arguments. The group took a steamer cruise around the islands, passing by famous ship-building yards and historic sites, and later visited the Western Highlands, known for its deer forests and wild moors. During their summer vacation, they also went on a yacht trip with American cousins, visiting the Isle of Skye and the Shetland Isles. The trip was filled with exciting adventures, including a memorable picnic where Donald and Sandy got left behind on one of the islands."
