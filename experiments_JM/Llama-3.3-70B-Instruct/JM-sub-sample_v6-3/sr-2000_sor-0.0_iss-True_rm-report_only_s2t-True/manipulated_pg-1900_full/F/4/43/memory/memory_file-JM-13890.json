        "section_summary": "In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral."

In 597, Augustine and his missionaries arrived in Canterbury, and Ethelbert allowed them to preach and instruct his people, leading to the conversion of many Saxons, including the king himself. The city became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The early Christian churches in Canterbury, including St. Martin's and St. Augustine's, played a significant role in the Christianization of England, and the city continued to grow and prosper despite attacks by the Danes. The city's cathedral, Christ Church, was eventually rebuilt after being burnt down by the Danes in 1011, and it remains a central part of the Church of England to this day."

The new cathedral, completed in 1077, included a crypt under the choir, a feature inspired by the original Saxon church. Over the years, the cathedral underwent several changes, including the construction of a new Norman choir by Prior Ernulph, which was consecrated in 1130. In 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in the cathedral by four knights, an event that was a culmination of his long-standing conflict with King Henry II. The cathedral continued to be an important site for the Church and a destination for pilgrims, with its grandeur and history making it a significant landmark in Canterbury."

The monks, upon discovering Becket's austere and ascetic lifestyle, including a hair-cloth shirt and numerous self-inflicted wounds, immediately revered him as a saint. The news of his martyrdom spread quickly, and people flocked to Canterbury to obtain relics and seek healing from his blood-stained garments. King Henry II, realizing the gravity of his mistake, performed a severe penance at Becket's tomb, including walking barefoot and receiving physical punishment from bishops and monks. This event marked the beginning of Canterbury's transformation into a major pilgrimage site, with Becket becoming one of the most revered saints in Europe."

After a fire damaged the Cathedral in the 12th century, it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman, who incorporated elements of the Gothic style. The Cathedral was further modified over the centuries, with additions and renovations made in the 13th to 15th centuries, including the construction of a new shrine for Becket's remains. The city's importance as a pilgrimage site and its role as a center of ecclesiastical authority helped it maintain its wealth and influence, even as it began to decline after the dissolution of the monasteries. The Cathedral remains a significant and beautiful landmark, with its towers and architecture still inspiring wonder and awe in visitors today."

The narrator also explores the surrounding monastic buildings, including the infirmary, the treasury, and the Prior's Gate, and comments on the beautiful Perpendicular work and the historic significance of the site. The Cathedral's interior is described as a vast and ordered space, with a cool, greenish light, and the narrator reflects on the contrast between the building's grandeur and the smallness of everyday life. The narrator sets the scene for a tour of the Cathedral's interior, beginning at the south porch, a beautiful feature with a double row of canopied niches containing statues."

The Trinity Chapel, where the shrine of St. Thomas once stood, is now an empty space, but still evokes a deep sense of history and significance. The chapel is adorned with a fine thirteenth-century mosaic pavement and features the tombs of King Henry IV and the Black Prince, with the latter's tomb being a magnificent piece of work. The chapel's windows, which illustrate the cures wrought at the Shrine of St. Thomas, are a remarkable series of thirteenth-century glass that have survived almost unharmed."
