Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, and have a language that resembles Khirgis and Turkish. The village has a small, poorly used temple, and the local administration is overseen by a pykh and his assistant, with the villagers paying a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The team was able to gather some information about the tribe, but the Yögurs were hesitant to share their history, legends, and songs, possibly due to suspicion or other reasons.

Section section_04 (Chars 24860–33012):
Section Summary: The author set out to visit the Shera Yögur Prince in the Nanshan mountains, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, who rode a small pony that kept pace with the author's larger horse. Along the way, they passed through a barren landscape with poor soil and coarse grass, and the author noted the lama's lack of endurance and energy. The author later prepared to visit the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'ang-lung-ssu, was challenging, with a difficult road and slippery ice, but they eventually arrived at the monastery, which was a collection of buildings with a large temple. The monastery, also known as Rtangu rgonba, was situated on the lower slopes of small hills and was surrounded by dozens of houses, most of which were low and unpretentious.

Section section_05 (Chars 33013–41250):
Section Summary: The author visited a monastery in K'anglungssu, where they observed the simple and traditional living quarters of the lamas, with timber buildings, dark rooms, and minimal household goods. The monastery's temple, known as the Yögur temple, was a large and impressive structure with Tibetan influence, featuring Buddhist pictures, banners, and a bronze statue of Tsunkoa. The lamas, who numbered only around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading services. The author eventually left the monastery, saying goodbye to the lamas and departing with the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo, as their guide.

Section section_06 (Chars 41251–49022):
Section Summary: The author describes the appearance and demeanor of the lamas, who wear red mantles and have expressive faces.

The t'umus receive small gifts for their services, but there are no written laws, and important questions are referred to the eldest t'umu or the Chinese authorities. The Shera Yögurs have a unclear origin, but they believe they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi, and they consider themselves to be Mongolian and related to the Sarö Yögurs. The author notes that the Shera Yögurs have a simple way of life, with traditional dwellings and a lack of modern comforts, and they have limited knowledge of their history and ancestry.

Section section_07 (Chars 49023–56672):
Section Summary: The Yögurs, a tribe in China, were originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors. The current Yögur population is a remnant of six families sent to the area by the Chinese government, and they have been greatly diminished due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element. The Shera Yögurs are divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage arrangements, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional practices. The tribe is led by a nominal head, Ta t'umu, but his authority is limited, and the settlement of taxes is not under his control.
