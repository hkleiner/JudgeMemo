As they gained experience, their wages increased, and by 15, they were considered a foreman, earning $15 a week. At 17, they saved enough money to travel to Chicago, where they met Frank Bromley, a landscape painter who introduced them to Rand McNally, but they struggled to learn wood-engraving. After returning to the Iron Ore newspaper, they saved more money and returned to Chicago at 18, where they were offered a job at Rand McNally with a slight increase in pay. The narrator's experiences in Chicago marked the beginning of their journey in the art and printing world."

The city is experiencing a cultural and artistic boom, with writers, artists, and publishers contributing to its vibrant scene. The narrator, a young artist, is part of this scene, working on various design projects, including book covers, posters, and magazine illustrations, and interacting with notable figures of the time. As the narrator's career advances, they move to Geneva, Illinois, and later to Springfield, where they establish the Wayside Press and publish their own magazine, Bradley: His Book. The period is marked by a growing interest in typography and design, although the field is still dominated by poor taste and a lack of basic design principles."

In 1895, he visited the Boston Public Library and discovered the noble ancestry of Caslon through the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience had a profound impact on him, and he became inspired to create typography that was spontaneous and joyful. He later established the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, and began printing with Caslon type, which was initially met with skepticism by other printers. The author's passion for typography and printing led to the creation of unique and beautiful publications, including a Strathmore deckle-edge sample book, which showcased his skill and artistry."

The author then moved to New York, where they attempted to establish themselves as a designer, printer, editor, and publisher.

        "section_summary": "At the age of 62, Will Bradley retired to southern California in 1930. A quarter-century later, his work experienced a renaissance, culminating in the 1954 Portfolio, a significant design accomplishment. The portfolio was introduced at a luncheon in New York, where several notable figures paid tribute to Bradley's work. The book about Bradley's life and work was assembled from separate papers he wrote between 1949 and 1954, with some editing to create a continuous narrative. The project was a cooperative effort, with significant contributions from Peter Beilenson, who helped with design, printing, and editing."
