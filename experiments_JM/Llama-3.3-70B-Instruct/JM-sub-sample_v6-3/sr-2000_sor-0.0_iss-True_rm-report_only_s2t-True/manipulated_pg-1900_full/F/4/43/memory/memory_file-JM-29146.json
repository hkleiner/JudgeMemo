Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with proto-man, and he becomes concerned about the implications of her accessing the matter-transmitter. Just as Margot approaches the box, Garr Symm and his men appear, trying to stop her, and a physical confrontation ensues. Despite being on a timeless world where death is supposedly impossible, one of the Irwadi men dies after his space suit is damaged, revealing that the rules of this world may not be as absolute as they seemed."

Vardin, a proto-human, reveals that her ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall and regression to a savage state. Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and with Ramsey's help, she has succeeded. Ramsey and Margot return to their ship, and as they blast off, Margot confesses her love for Ramsey, and they look forward to exploring space together. Vardin, having completed her task, disappears, leaving Ramsey and Margot to their new life together."
