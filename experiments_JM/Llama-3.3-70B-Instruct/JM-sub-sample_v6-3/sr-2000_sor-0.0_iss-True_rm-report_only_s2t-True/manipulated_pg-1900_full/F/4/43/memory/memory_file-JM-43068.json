        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Elder, who is now recognized as one of the greatest masters of peasant painting. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are infused with a deep understanding of the struggles and troubles of the peasant class. His unique style, which is marked by subtleties of line and tone, is influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters and his own experiences living a life of struggle and hardship. Overall, Millet's work is a powerful and enduring portrayal of peasant life, and his paintings continue to be appreciated for their intense earnestness and melancholy truth."

His paintings, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", showcased the loneliness and monotony of a peasant's labor, but also highlighted the importance of their work. Millet's art was not about technical brilliance, but about conveying a message and evoking emotion. He was part of a movement that sought to break away from conventional landscape painting, which had become stagnant in 19th-century France. Through his work, Millet aimed to make the viewer forget the technical aspects of painting and absorb the lesson or message he was trying to convey."

        "section_summary": "In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged and picturesque landscape shaping his perspective. Millet's family encouraged his early interest in drawing, and he spent his spare time reading and sketching the people and objects around him. As he grew older, Millet's passion for art only intensified, and he eventually made the decision to leave his rural home and migrate to Paris to pursue a career in art. His early life and experiences would later influence his unique style, which would become a hallmark of the modern naturalistic school."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, leading him to study with M. Langlois in Cherbourg. Langlois, who had a classical style, tried to mold Millet in his own method, but the young artist eventually struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a profound influence on his art. Millet eventually left the studio of Delaroche, where he had been studying, due to neglect and financial difficulties, and was now free to develop his own unique style and work towards recognition as an artist."

Millet's art was influenced by his own experiences as a peasant and his connection to the natural world, which differed from his friend Rousseau's focus on landscapes and solitude. Despite facing many challenges, including poverty and criticism, Millet continued to produce remarkable works, such as \"The Winnower,\" and eventually gained recognition as an artist. His move to Barbizon marked a significant turning point in his career, allowing him to develop his unique style and artistic vision."
