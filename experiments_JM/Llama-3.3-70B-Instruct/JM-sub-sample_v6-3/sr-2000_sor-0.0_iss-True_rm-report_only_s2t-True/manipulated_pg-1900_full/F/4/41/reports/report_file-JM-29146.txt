Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot from Earth, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–15935):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive. The encounter leaves Ramsey feeling uneasy, and he wonders about the reason behind Symm's appointment as Security Chief. The situation highlights the tensions between Earthmen and the native Irwadians, who resent the influence of Earth in the galaxy.

Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an administrator, intervenes when Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, mistreats a Vegan girl, Mith, in a gambling hall. Ramsey hits Symm and escapes with the girl, taking her to his room in the Old Quarter to gather his belongings before they go into hiding. However, upon arriving at his room, he finds an Earthgirl waiting for him, who claims to be a telepath and has taken possession of his m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is provocatively dressed and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, leaving him unsure of her intentions. Ramsey is cautious, but the Earthgirl's abilities and confident demeanor have him at a disadvantage.

Section Summary: Ramsey and a Vegan girl are held at gunpoint by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl who claims to have met Ramsey before, but he doesn't remember her. Margot offers to pay Ramsey 1,000 credits to take her through hyper-space to Centauri, and he agrees on the condition that the Vegan girl comes too. After a night's rest at Margot's apartment, Ramsey and the Vegan girl wake up to find that Margot has left and locked them in. While waiting for Margot's return, Ramsey searches the apartment and finds a letter from someone who appears to be a close relation, revealing that Margot is searching for a specific hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth. The letter hints at a significant discovery related to the origins of proto-men, and Margot is determined to keep this information secret.

Section Summary: A dying man writes a letter to his daughter Margot, revealing his research on "proto-man," a hypothetical ancestor of humanity who allegedly traveled through hyper-space to populate the galaxy. The man believes that whoever discovers proto-man's secret will become incredibly powerful, and he urges Margot to continue his work. Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, and they begin to prepare for a journey, while also trying to evade the authorities who are searching for them. As they work on a old spaceship in a junkyard, Margot reveals that she can read minds and senses that they are being watched. Ramsey is drawn to Margot, but is also wary of her ability to read his thoughts, particularly about the mysterious proto-man letter.

Section section_06 (Chars 39697–47571):
Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin are trying to escape from the planet Irwadi, but they are being followed by Security Officer Ramar Chind and his boss Garr Symm. Garr Symm, a scientist, has discovered a valuable letter in Margot's apartment and wants to let them escape so he can follow them and uncover more information. Chind is instructed to load a wrecked ship with the fuel they need, U-235 slow-implosion capsules, to aid in their escape. Meanwhile, Vardin uses a scintillation counter to find the fuel they need, and Margot retrieves it from a wrecked ship. Garr Symm's ultimate goal is to use the information to make Irwadi the dominant planet in the galaxy, with him as the absolute dictator.

Section Summary: The Enterprise is preparing to embark on a journey through hyper-space in search of a valuable find. Margot Dennison, a beautiful and cunning woman, is trying to uncover the secrets of proto-man, a pre-human ancestor of all humanoid races. As the Enterprise enters hyper-space, Ramsey explains the concept of timelessness in this realm, where duration is subjective and there is no fourth dimension. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and Ramar Chind are tracking the Enterprise from their ship, the Dog Star, using radar that behaves perfectly in hyper-space. The Enterprise encounters eddies in hyper-space, which Ramsey navigates, explaining that they are like unmarked shoals in an ocean that must be avoided.

Section section_08 (Chars 55919–63895):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison takes control of the Enterprise, forcing Ramsey to land on a mysterious world in hyper-space that is believed to be the home of proto-man. Despite the ship's environment-checker indicating a lethal environment with extreme cold and lack of air, Margot is determined to explore the world, convinced that the absence of time in hyper-space will protect her. Ramsey, who had been trying to resist Margot's demands, eventually gives in, realizing that the lack of time in hyper-space could indeed make the environment harmless. Margot decides to take Vardin, the Vegan girl, with her to explore the world, using the m.g. gun to ensure Ramsey's compliance. As they prepare to venture out, Ramsey seems to have resigned himself to Margot's plans, warning her about the potential dangers of tampering with unknown powers.

Section Summary: Margot and Ramsey, accompanied by Vardin, venture out of their ship and into a timeless world, where they encounter a beautiful, otherworldly music. The music, known as the "Music of the Spheres," is a legend on many worlds and seems to be connected to the nature of this timeless place. As they listen, the fog surrounding them begins to lift, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot recognizes as a matter-transmitter, a device that could grant immense power and control over the galaxy. However, their discovery is soon interrupted by the arrival of Garr Symm and his men, who attempt to stop Margot from reaching the device. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men to protect Margot and the matter-transmitter.

Section Summary: Ramsey fought off the Irwadi space-suited figures, who died after their helmets were damaged, apparently due to mental suggestion. Vardin, a Proto-man, revealed that his people had discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Garr Symm, who had used the matter-transmission device, emerged with the face of his caveman ancestors, illustrating the devastating consequences of the technology. Vardin, a guardian, had been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this power, and with his mission accomplished, he disappeared. Ramsey and Margot, who had developed feelings for each other, left the planet and blasted off into space, ready to start a new life together.
