The group set sail from San Francisco on the US Army Transport \"Thomas\" and traveled to the Philippines, stopping at Honolulu along the way. During their stop in Honolulu, they visited notable sites such as the Pali, a gigantic precipice, and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology, which houses a collection of artifacts illustrating Polynesian life and customs. After crossing the International Date Line, the group lost a day and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs of the native people. The author describes the rough waters of Manila Bay and the unique attire and habits of the native women, including their traditional clothing and cigar-smoking habits."

The teachers face challenges, including a lack of schoolhouses and supplies, but eventually succeed in setting up schools and introducing English as the basis of instruction. In the town of Talisay, a public school for boys is established, and despite initial chaos, the superintendent implements a uniform system, leading to progress in the students' learning. The teachers also participate in social events, including a \"baile\" hosted by the town of Silay, where they interact with the local elite and experience the town's vibrant social life."

The traditional Filipino home is characterized by a unique arrangement of furniture, with a large mirror, settee, and chairs, which allows for face-to-face conversation and a glimpse of the young ladies in the mirror. The lifestyle of Filipinos varies greatly depending on their wealth, with the rich enjoying polished floors, servants, and abundant food, while the poor, known as the \"tao\", live simple lives with limited food and resources. Overall, life in the Philippines is marked by two extremes: the active, progressive city life and the inactive, traditional rural life."

The writer was struck by the contrast between the happiness of the children and the suffering of the adults, and was moved by the old man's appeal for aid.
