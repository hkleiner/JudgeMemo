Section section_01 (Chars 0–8762):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, standing out among his contemporaries for his profound and sympathetic rendering of everyday life. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, absorbing sincerity, and subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters. His paintings, such as "The Angelus", convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are not sentimental, but rather a truthful portrayal of the struggles and simple faith of peasant life. Millet's unique style and technique, shaped by his own life experiences and connection to the natural world, have secured his position as a great artist, even if he may not be considered a technical virtuoso.

Section section_02 (Chars 8763–17378):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet was a philosopher-artist who used his brush to convey profound thoughts and observations about life. His artwork often featured peasants and rural scenes, highlighting the simplicity and hardships of their daily lives. Millet's style was characterized by restraint and a focus on conveying a message rather than showcasing technical skill. He was particularly drawn to depicting the struggles and loneliness of peasant labor, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen" and "The Sower". Millet's art is best understood as a means to convey his philosophical observations, rather than solely as a demonstration of technical painting skill.

Section section_03 (Chars 17379–25874):
Section Summary: The French art world was dominated by classical traditions during the time of Louis XVI, making it difficult for artists to introduce new and naturalistic styles. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art, with the rugged and picturesque landscape shaping his perspective. Millet's family was simple and hardworking, and he was raised with a strong sense of values and a appreciation for nature and beauty. As a young boy, Millet was drawn to art and literature, and he began to develop his skills by drawing the objects and scenes around him, eventually creating his first significant work at the age of 17. Millet's early life and experiences laid the foundation for his future as a leading figure in the modern naturalistic school of art.

Section section_04 (Chars 25875–34565):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's early life was marked by a strong inclination towards art, which was encouraged by his family. He was apprenticed to a painter in Cherbourg, where he developed his skills, but later returned home to manage the family farm after his father's death. Millet's passion for art persisted, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study under another artist, before being awarded a pension to study in Paris. In Paris, he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, which had a profound influence on his artistic style. However, his time in Paris was not without challenges, including a disappointing experience studying under Delaroche, whose academic and traditional approach to art clashed with Millet's more innovative and naturalistic style.

Section section_06 (Chars 42953–51519):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet, a peasant painter, found inspiration in the daily life of villagers and peasants, which is reflected in his works. He settled in Barbizon, where he led a simple life, growing his own food and painting in the afternoons, and produced some of his most notable works, including "The Sower" and "The Gleaners". Despite his talent, Millet struggled financially and faced criticism from art critics and some fellow artists, but he continued to paint, driven by his own genius and vision. His paintings, such as "The Angelus" and "Man with the Hoe", would later become highly valued and influential, with some selling for large sums of money. Millet's life was marked by financial difficulties, but he found some comfort in a commission to create four allegorical compositions representing the Seasons, which brought him a sense of joy and fulfillment.
