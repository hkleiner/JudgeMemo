Despite his injuries, Robert tries to make his way back to Washington's army, but instead, he comes across Morley, who is also wounded and dying. Morley asks Robert to deliver a message to his mother in London, and also to find a girl named Deborah Mason in Plymouth and tell her that all will be forgiven. Robert promises to fulfill Morley's requests and, after Morley's death, he sets out to reach Washington's army, guided by the sound of heavy firing in the distance. Weakened by his own wound, Robert struggles to stay on his feet, fearing that he may not survive to deliver the messages or report back to Washington."
