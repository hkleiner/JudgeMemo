He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi."

The music, known as the \"Music of the Spheres,\" is a legend on many worlds and seems to be connected to the nature of this timeless place. As they listen, the fog surrounding them begins to lift, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot recognizes as a matter-transmitter, a device that could grant immense power and control over the galaxy. However, their discovery is soon interrupted by the arrival of Garr Symm and his men, who attempt to stop Margot from reaching the device. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men to protect Margot and the matter-transmitter."

Vardin, a Proto-man, revealed that his people had discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Garr Symm, who had used the matter-transmission device, emerged with the face of his caveman ancestors, illustrating the devastating consequences of the technology. Vardin, a guardian, had been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this power, and with his mission accomplished, he disappeared. Ramsey and Margot, who had developed feelings for each other, left the planet and blasted off into space, ready to start a new life together."
