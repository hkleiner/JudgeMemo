They take a tram to Battersea and, upon arrival, try to find the home without asking for directions, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful. A street boy they ask for help gives them a mischievous and unhelpful response, telling them to \"bite a policeman.\" The couple then spots an official from the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs and decides to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in awkward situations, trying to avoid detection while pretending to be interested in various shop windows."

Eileen soon arrived and was charmed by the curate, and the two struck up a conversation, with Excalibur serving as a chaperon. As they talked, Excalibur continued to cause mischief, eating food and knocking over objects, but the curate was smitten with Eileen and enjoyed her company. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself overworked as a chaperon, as Eileen and the curate spent more time together, including playing tennis on the lawn that Excalibur considered his own sanctuary."
