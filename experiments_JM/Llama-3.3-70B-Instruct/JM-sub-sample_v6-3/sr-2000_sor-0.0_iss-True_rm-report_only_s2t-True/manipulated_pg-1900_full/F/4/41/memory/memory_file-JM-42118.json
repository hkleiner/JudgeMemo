Growing up in a picturesque and romantic environment, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. However, Fragonard's father had other plans for him, apprenticing him to a notary, a path that did not align with the young man's artistic ambitions. Eventually, his notary master recognized Fragonard's passion for art and advised that he be allowed to pursue his creative interests."

However, Fragonard made little progress with Chardin and was sent away, after which he spent time studying and painting the masterpieces in Parisian churches. He later returned to Boucher, who was impressed with his progress and took him on as a student, assigning him to work on decorative cartoons. Fragonard went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 and later traveled to Italy, where he was influenced by the works of Tiepolo and the Italian landscape, ultimately developing his own unique style. During his time in Italy, Fragonard formed lasting friendships with fellow artists Hubert Robert and the Abbé de Saint-Non."

Fragonard initially attempted to paint in the academic style, but soon turned to painting the life and beauty around him, which brought him great success. His breakthrough came with the painting \"Les hazards heureux de l'Escarpolette,\" which showcased his skill in capturing the beauty of nature and launched him into fame. As the favorite painter of the French court, Fragonard became known for his decorative and lively paintings, which reflected the spirit of the age of Du Barry. His art was characterized by its emphasis on landscape and its ability to capture the beauty of the natural world, earning him a reputation as one of the great landscape-painters of France."

The writings of intellectuals such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot fueled the growing discontent among the people, who were tired of the privileged class and their abuses of power. Meanwhile, Fragonard was oblivious to the impending doom and was preparing for a second journey to Italy with his patron, Bergeret de Grandcour.

However, his happiness was short-lived, as his daughter Rosalie died at the age of 18, and the French Revolution began to unfold, marked by the fall of the Bastille and the rise of the National Assembly.

He continued to paint, but his work was no longer in fashion, and he was eventually forced to leave his lodging at the Louvre due to a decree by Napoleon. Fragonard's health declined, and he died on August 22, 1806, at the age of 74. His family, including his wife and daughter Marguerite Gérard, lived on, with Marguerite having a successful career as an artist. Fragonard's art, along with that of Watteau and Boucher, is now recognized as a key part of France's cultural heritage, embodying the elegance and gaiety of 18th-century France."
