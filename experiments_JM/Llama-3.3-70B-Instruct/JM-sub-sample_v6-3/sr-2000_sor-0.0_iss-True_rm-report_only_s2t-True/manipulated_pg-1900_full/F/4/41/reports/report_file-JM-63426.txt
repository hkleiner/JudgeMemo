The chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, from his early days in Lynn, Massachusetts, to his move to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he developed a passion for art and printing.

Section section_02 (Chars 8375–16515):
Section Summary: The narrator, who disliked arithmetic, left school at a young age to work at the Iron Agitator newspaper office, where he learned the printing trade and eventually became a job printer. He worked his way up, earning higher wages and more responsibilities, and even turned down a job offer from a rival newspaper to stay with his current employer. At 17, he saved enough money to travel to Chicago to pursue his dream of becoming an artist, where he met a landscape painter who introduced him to Rand McNally, a company that offered him an unpaid apprenticeship in engraving. However, he soon realized that designers and illustrators did not engrave their own blocks and returned to his printing job in Michigan. He later returned to Chicago at 18, took up the apprenticeship again, and began working at Rand McNally for a small wage.

Section section_05 (Chars 33148–41781):
Section Summary: During the Victorian period, typography had declined, with typefounders producing novelty faces and compositors mixing multiple typefaces. However, the author, Will Bradley, developed a love for traditional Caslon typefaces after visiting the Boston Public Library and accessing the Barton collection of Colonial-era books. This experience inspired him to establish the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1895, where he printed materials using Caslon typefaces, which initially received criticism from printers but eventually gained popularity. The Wayside Press was part of a larger aesthetic awakening in the field of publishing, with other presses and designers also producing high-quality, artistic works. Bradley's press was named for its location, which he saw as a temporary stop on his way to becoming an artist, and its device was a dandelion leaf, symbolizing a wayside growth.

Section Summary: The author recalls a meeting with Mr. Hearst, where he presented a dummy of his work and received positive feedback.
