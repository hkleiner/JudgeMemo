Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although he is tempted to do so. Lady Jane eventually brings up the review at tea, and the narrator is relieved that she is praising it, which may help to impress Vereker."
