        "section_summary": "Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a painter and her mother Sophie Marquis a musician. The family struggled financially, and Rosa's early life was marked by frequent moves and exposure to art and music. She developed a passion for drawing and painting at a young age and was eventually allowed to work in her father's studio, where she created her first painting, a still life of cherries. Her father's encouragement and her own determination set her on the path to becoming an artist. Rosa's unconventional upbringing, including being raised with her brothers and attending a boys' school, likely influenced her development as a strong-willed and talented artist."

Rosa's hard work paid off when her paintings were accepted into the Salon in 1841, and she continued to exhibit her work annually, gaining recognition and praise from critics and the public. Her success grew progressively, and in 1848, she was awarded a first-class medal at the Salon, judged by her peers without academic prejudice. Rosa's personal life also underwent changes during this period, including her father's remarriage and the birth of a half-brother, which led her to move into her own studio and start a new chapter in her life."

She later sent several works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a medal of the second class, likely due to the judges' resentment of her long absence from France and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, which she directed with devotion and intelligence, but eventually resigned in 1860 to focus on her own work. After retiring to her home in By, she devoted herself to her art, producing many notable works, but ceased to exhibit publicly until the year of her death in 1899. During the Franco-Prussian War, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotic spirit by aiding peasants and distributing donations to relieve their suffering."

Her death was met with an outpouring of tributes and regrets from the press and the art world, celebrating her dignity, character, and greatness. She was laid to rest in the Père-Lachaise cemetery, with a large and eminent cortège in attendance, testifying to her well-respected and beloved personality."
