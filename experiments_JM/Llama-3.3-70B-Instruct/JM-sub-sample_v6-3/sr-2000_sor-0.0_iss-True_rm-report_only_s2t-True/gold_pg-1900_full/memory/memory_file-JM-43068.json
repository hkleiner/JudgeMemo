        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, often compared to Dutch masters such as Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, reflecting his own gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters like Andrea Mantegna. His paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" capture the struggles and simple faith of rural life, and are not sentimental but rather infused with intense earnestness and melancholy truth. Millet's unique style, shaped by his experiences living among peasants, is marked by subtlety and restraint, rather than showy technique. As a painter, Millet's strength lies in his ability to convey a profound message, rather than in flashy brushwork or pyrotechnics."

His artwork often featured lonely, laborious scenes, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", which highlighted the monotony and importance of rural work. Millet's unique style was characterized by restraint and a lack of virtuosity, as he prioritized illustrating his philosophical observations over showcasing technical skill. His art was not meant to impress with its technique, but to convey a message and evoke a sense of understanding and empathy in the viewer. Millet's approach to art was distinct from that of his contemporaries, and his work marked a departure from the conventional landscape painting of his time."

        "section_summary": "In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, but a small group of artists, including Jean-François Millet, sought to create a more naturalistic style. Millet was born in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, to a peasant family and grew up surrounded by the harsh beauty of the countryside. His childhood, marked by simplicity and hard work, had a profound influence on his later art, and he often drew inspiration from the landscapes and people of his native region. As a young man, Millet worked on his family's farm and developed his skills as an artist, encouraged by his family, before eventually leaving for Paris to pursue his artistic career. His early life and experiences laid the foundation for his unique style, which would later become renowned for its depiction of rural life and landscapes."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, leading him to study with M. Langlois in Cherbourg. Langlois, who had a classical style, tried to mold Millet in his own method, but the young artist eventually struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a profound influence on his style. Millet eventually placed himself under the tutelage of Delaroche, but found the experience unsuitable and ultimately ceased to frequent his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties."

He eventually moved to Barbizon, where he found inspiration in the peasant life and was able to focus on his true artistic passions. Millet's art was shaped by his own experiences as a peasant and his connection to the natural world, which differed from his friend Théodore Rousseau's focus on landscapes and solitude. Despite facing many challenges, including poverty and criticism, Millet continued to produce remarkable works, such as \"The Winnower,\" and eventually gained recognition as an artist. His move to Barbizon marked a significant turning point in his career, allowing him to escape the struggles of city life and focus on his art."

However, his health began to decline due to a persistent cough, and he eventually passed away on January 20, 1875. Millet's art is characterized by his passionate sympathy with the common people, particularly peasants, and his ability to convey the struggles and hardships of their daily lives. His work had a profound influence on other artists, including Segantini, and continues to be celebrated for its sincerity and emotional depth. Millet's legacy is that of a poet, philosopher, and great thinker who expressed himself through his art, leaving behind a body of work that is both melancholic and truthful."
