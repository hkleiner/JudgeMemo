Section Summary: Tony Croft, a curious and inquisitive boy, was often considered lazy by the villagers because he didn't conform to traditional learning methods.

He had a passion for music and spent hours taking apart and repairing musical instruments, eventually becoming skilled enough to fix complex instruments like violins. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother tolerated his eccentricities. As he grew older, Tony's skills and knowledge continued to expand, and he developed a deep understanding of the world around him, driven by his insatiable curiosity and love for learning.
