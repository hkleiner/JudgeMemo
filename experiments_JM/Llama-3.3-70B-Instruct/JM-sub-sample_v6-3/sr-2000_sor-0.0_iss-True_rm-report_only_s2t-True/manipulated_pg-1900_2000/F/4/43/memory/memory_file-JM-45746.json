        "section_summary": "The author recounts how they became a teacher by chance, without any prior aspiration or preparation, and how this was a common experience for many of their associates. The author then shares two contrasting stories of young men who entered the teaching profession, one who was uninterested and unprepared, and another who was enthusiastic and dedicated to making a positive impact. The second young man's attention to detail and commitment to creating a comfortable learning environment ultimately led to his success and advancement in the field. In contrast, the first young man's lack of interest and preparation led to a negative experience. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, and notes that a pleasing and forceful personality is a key factor in attracting and inspiring young people."

To be successful, a teacher must have a good general education and specialize in their chosen field, while also continually broadening their knowledge. When applying for positions, teachers should be careful in filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A teacher's motivation for applying for a position should be understood by their current superintendent, who can then provide support and assistance. Ultimately, a teacher's goal should be professional growth and improvement, rather than just seeking a higher-paying job."
