        "section_summary": "Joshua Reynolds was a talented and determined individual who was born with a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common sense, which enabled him to achieve great things in the art world. He is considered one of the greatest painters of the 18th century, and his work had a significant impact on the development of English art. Reynolds' journey to Italy, where he studied and copied the works of great masters, was a pivotal moment in his career, and it helped him to develop his technique and style. He was a skilled copyist and was influenced by artists such as Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens, and he was able to take the best from each of them and apply it to his own work. Reynolds' determination and hard work ultimately led to his success, and he became the first President of the Royal Academy, where he shared his knowledge and expertise with students through his annual discourses."

        "section_summary": "After returning from a holiday, Sir Joshua Reynolds opened a studio in St. Martin's Street, which quickly led to success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and patronage from Lord Edgcumbe. As his career progressed, he moved to larger studios, raising his prices, but his popularity remained unchanged. Unlike many artists, Reynolds was not only a skilled painter but also a man of the world, with a wide range of interests and friendships with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Despite having some human weaknesses, including snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, Reynolds was able to learn and grow from his associations with refined and intelligent people. Overall, Reynolds' life and personality are more interesting and nuanced when seen in their entirety, rather than being judged solely on his moral character."
