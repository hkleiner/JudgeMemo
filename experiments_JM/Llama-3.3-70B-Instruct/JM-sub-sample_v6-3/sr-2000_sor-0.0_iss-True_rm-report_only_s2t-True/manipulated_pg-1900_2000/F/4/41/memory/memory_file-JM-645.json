Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to assist a friend, Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but doesn't get a chance to discuss his review with him, although he is tempted to do so. Eventually, Lady Jane brings up the review and praises it, potentially doing for the narrator what he couldn't do for himself in terms of impressing Vereker."

The reviewer is actually the narrator, who reveals their identity to Lady Jane, but she seems less impressed than expected. At dinner, the narrator hopes to see Vereker's reaction to the review, but Lady Jane doesn't bring it up. However, another guest, Miss Poyle, asks Vereker about the review, and to the narrator's surprise, Vereker dismisses it as \"twaddle\" and later says the author \"doesn't see anything\", implying that the review missed the true depth of his work. Vereker's response is enigmatic and amusing, leaving the narrator and others to wonder what he really means."
