Section section_01 (Chars 0–7800):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point with two anecdotes: one about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase but doesn't truly appreciate the books, and another about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognizes the value of classic literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both light reading and serious literature, and that the ability to distinguish between the two is what truly matters. Ultimately, being a bookman is not about the quantity or quality of one's book collection, but about a genuine love and respect for the written word.

Section section_02 (Chars 7800–11574):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between popular novels that are quickly forgotten and classic books that stand the test of time. A true book lover can distinguish between books that are mere entertainment and those that have lasting value and wisdom. According to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, a classic book is one that enriches the human mind, speaks to all in a unique style, and transcends time. The author values books like "Mark Rutherford" and "The Pilgrim's Progress" for their strong thinking, pure style, and timeless wisdom. A bookman's collection should include a mix of classic works, regardless of their subject matter, as they provide inspiration and peace for generations to come.
