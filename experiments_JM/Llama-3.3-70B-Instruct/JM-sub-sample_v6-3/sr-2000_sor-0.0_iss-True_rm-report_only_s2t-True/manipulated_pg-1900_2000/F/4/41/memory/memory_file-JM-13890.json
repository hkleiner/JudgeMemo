        "section_summary": "In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement called Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral."

        "section_summary": "Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. Prior to 597, the Saxon capital of southeastern England was largely heathen, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard. In 597, Augustine arrived and was allowed to preach and instruct in Canterbury, leading to the conversion of Ethelbert and many Saxons to Christianity. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city's St. Martin's Church, where Augustine and his monks began to preach, is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, with its origins possibly dating back to the Roman or Saxon period."
