        "section_summary": "Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker father. Growing up in a picturesque Provençal setting, Fragonard was surrounded by natural beauty that would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful patron of the arts. At the age of 15, Fragonard's father attempted to steer him towards a respectable career as a notary's clerk, but the young man's passion for art led him to idle and eventually pursue his creative interests. Fragonard's early life was marked by a tension between his father's practical expectations and his own artistic ambitions."

        "section_summary": "In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, after reviewing the boy's sketches, advised him to train with Chardin to learn the basics of painting, but Fragonard made little progress and was eventually sent away. Undeterred, Fragonard continued to practice and returned to Boucher six months later, showing significant improvement, and was taken on as a student. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard worked on decorative cartoons and enlargements for tapestries, which provided ideal training for him. At the age of 20, Fragonard won the prestigious Prix de Rome with his painting \"Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols,\" launching his successful artistic career."
