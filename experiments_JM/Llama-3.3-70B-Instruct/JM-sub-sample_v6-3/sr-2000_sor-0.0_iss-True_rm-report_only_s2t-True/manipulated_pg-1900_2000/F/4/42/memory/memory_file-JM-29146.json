Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is temporarily grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot license. With no ship to pilot, Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the titanium trade, a crucial element for interstellar ships."

Englander is grateful and promises to use the money wisely, and Ramsey feels good about his decision. Later, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall in the Old Quarter, but has a bad night and loses most of his money. He is then confronted by a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who is looking for trouble and tells Ramsey to leave. The situation becomes tense, with the Irwadian insulting outworlders and Ramsey remaining calm but aware of the potential for conflict."
