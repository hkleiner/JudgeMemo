Section Summary: After returning from a holiday, Sir Joshua Reynolds opened a studio in St. Martin's Street, which quickly led to success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and patronage. As his career grew, he moved to larger studios, increasing his prices, but his clients were willing to pay. Reynolds was not only a talented artist but also a man of the world, who chose his friends wisely and was inspired by the company of intellectuals like Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke.
