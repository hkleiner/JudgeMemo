Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him to ride. Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man while delivering mail, and how he chased the man and eventually gave him $10. Bud then retrieves a burro for Jim and they prepare to part ways, with Jim tying a gunny sack on the burro to ride. As they say their goodbyes, Bud knocks Jim's hat over his eyes, indicating their friendly and playful relationship."
