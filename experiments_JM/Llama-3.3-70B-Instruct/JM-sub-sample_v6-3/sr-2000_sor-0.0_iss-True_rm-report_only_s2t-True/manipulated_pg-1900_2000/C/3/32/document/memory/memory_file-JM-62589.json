Her father, a drunkard, is forced to leave the town and join a group of men headed to Boston, leaving Debby behind. Despite her love for her father, Debby is bound out to Mrs. Lane, a strict and proper woman, who tries to teach her discipline and manners. Debby is miserable in her new home, longing for her father and her old life, and finds comfort in secretly playing her drum, a childhood treasure. As she navigates her new life, Debby remembers her mother's words and promises to stay with her father, and she holds on to the hope of being reunited with him."

Mrs. Lane is concerned about Deborah's soul and warns her of eternal punishment, but Deborah is unmoved and defiant. When Mrs. Lane forbids her from seeing her friend Jack Martin, Deborah refuses to obey, leading to a physical punishment. After being sent to her room, Deborah reflects on her life and thinks about her mother and father, wondering if he may have been involved in the battles against the King's men. As the evening approaches, Deborah awaits Mrs. Lane's return, knowing she will face further punishment if she doesn't show repentance."
