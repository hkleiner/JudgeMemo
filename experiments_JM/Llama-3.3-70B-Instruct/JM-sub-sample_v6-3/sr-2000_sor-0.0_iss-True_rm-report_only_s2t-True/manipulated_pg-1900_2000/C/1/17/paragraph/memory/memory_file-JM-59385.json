        "section_summary": "Kuei Ping, a Chinese girl, had been inspired by her American teacher, Miss Porter, and the idea of freedom and equality in the United States. However, her family had already planned her marriage and she felt bound by her family ties, making it impossible for her to pursue her dreams. Kuei Ping had to decline Miss Porter's offer to help her, and the decision was a difficult one, causing her inner conflict. Meanwhile, in a separate storyline, a young girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was born in Paris to a family with a questionable reputation, unaware of the significant role she would play in the future. Kuei Ping's decision was finalized as she handed over the pearls to her grandmother, symbolizing her acceptance of her arranged marriage."
