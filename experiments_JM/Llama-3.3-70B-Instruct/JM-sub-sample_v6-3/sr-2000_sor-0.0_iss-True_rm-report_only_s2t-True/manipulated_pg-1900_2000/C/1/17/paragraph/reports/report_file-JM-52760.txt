Section section_01 (Chars 0–8260):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous battles, neither side had been able to gain a decisive victory, and the war seemed far from over. Union General Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to lead the Union armies and devised a strategy to capture Richmond and defeat the Army of Northern Virginia. Grant's army clashed with Confederate General Robert E. Lee's army in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but was unable to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia. Ultimately, Grant decided to target Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy, in an effort to isolate and capture Richmond.

Section section_02 (Chars 8260–13376):
Section Summary: Petersburg's strategic location made it a crucial transportation hub, with multiple railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's proximity to Richmond made it a vital point of transfer for goods and materials, and its security became a top concern as other supply lines were cut off. In June 1864, Union forces launched a series of raids on the railroads south and west of Petersburg, but were ultimately repelled by Southern army units. After the Battle of Cold Harbor, General Grant shifted his focus to capturing Petersburg, and on June 15, the XVIII Corps of the Army of the James, led by General Smith, crossed the Appomattox River to launch an attack on the city. With 18,000 Union soldiers approaching, the city's defenses, manned by less than 4,000 Confederate troops, were severely outnumbered.
