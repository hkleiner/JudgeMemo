        "section_summary": "The narrator's career is boosted when his friend George Corvick asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for \"The Middle\" magazine. Corvick is unable to write the review himself due to a personal emergency and entrusts the narrator with the task, urging him to \"get at\" Vereker's true meaning. The narrator spends the night reading the novel and writes a review, but later worries that it may not have done justice to the author. He meets Vereker at a social gathering and is tempted to discuss his review with him, but the opportunity is missed. Lady Jane eventually comes to the narrator's aid, praising his review and bringing it to Vereker's attention, potentially saving the narrator from embarrassment."

        "section_summary": "Lady Jane is enthusiastic about a review of Vereker's work and wants to share it with him, marking the most impressive parts. The author of the review reveals themselves to Lady Jane, but she seems less impressed once she knows it was written by someone she knows. At dinner, Vereker is asked about the review and surprisingly dismisses it as \"twaddle\", which shocks the author. The conversation is interrupted, but Vereker starts to explain that the author of the review doesn't truly understand his work, implying that they are missing something deeper. The author is left wondering about Vereker's cryptic comment and its implications."
