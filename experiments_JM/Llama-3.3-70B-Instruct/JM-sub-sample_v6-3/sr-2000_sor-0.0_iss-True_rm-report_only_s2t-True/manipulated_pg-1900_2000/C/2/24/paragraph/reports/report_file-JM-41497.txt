Section section_02 (Chars 8779–12342):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds quickly achieved success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. As his career grew, he moved to larger studios, first to Great Newport Street and then to Leicester Square, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Reynolds was not only a talented artist but also a man of the world, who chose his friends wisely and was inspired by the company of notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Despite his accomplishments, Reynolds had his flaws, including a touch of snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which were somewhat refined through his associations with distinguished people. Overall, Reynolds' life and work are more interesting when seen in their entirety, flaws and all, rather than being idealized or sanitized.
