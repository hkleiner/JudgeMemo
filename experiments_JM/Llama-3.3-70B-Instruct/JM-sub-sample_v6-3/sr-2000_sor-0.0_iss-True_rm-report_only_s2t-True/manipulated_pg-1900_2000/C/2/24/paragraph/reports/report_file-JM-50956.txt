Section section_01 (Chars 0–8636):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and four to five times those of England. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and efforts allowed the Allies to prepare and launch successful operations, including the defense of France and Italy. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was crucial, and its contributions should not be underestimated, despite its eventual collapse in 1917.

Section section_02 (Chars 8637–13249):
Section Summary: Germany's plan to defeat France, which relied on a threefold superiority in numbers and equal military skill, was foiled when Russia's unprepared army launched a surprise attack on East Prussia, diverting German forces. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed Germany's plan to concentrate all its forces against France, giving the Allies a crucial advantage. Russia's role in the war was significant, as it bore the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the early years, but this fact is often obscured by later events. Despite this, some, like General Ludendorf, have attempted to downplay Russia's contributions and slander its army. Russia's early sacrifices and efforts were instrumental in preventing a German victory, and its historic role in the war should be recognized and acknowledged.
