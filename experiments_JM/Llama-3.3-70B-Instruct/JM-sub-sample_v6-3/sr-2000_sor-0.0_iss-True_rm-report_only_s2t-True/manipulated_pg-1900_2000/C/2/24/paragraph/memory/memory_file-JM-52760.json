        "section_summary": "By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to ending the war, as it would cut off supplies to Richmond and likely lead to the city's abandonment."

        "section_summary": "Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, with tracks radiating in all directions, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" was constructed, featuring 55 artillery batteries, but it had weaknesses and required more troops to defend than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, set their sights on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps, commanded by General Smith, arriving on the scene with 18,000 soldiers to face less than 4,000 Confederate troops under General Beauregard. The Union forces aimed to capture Petersburg and cut off supplies to Richmond, marking the beginning of the Battle of Petersburg."
