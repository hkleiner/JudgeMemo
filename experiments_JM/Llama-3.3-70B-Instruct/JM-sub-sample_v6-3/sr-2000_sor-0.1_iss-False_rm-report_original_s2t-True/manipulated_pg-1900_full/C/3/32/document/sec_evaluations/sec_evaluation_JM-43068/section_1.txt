- [GRAMMAR] "a long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of the stuff" should be "a long interval elapsed between the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet"
- [LEXICON] "in a stuff" is unclear and seems to be a placeholder or error
- [SYNTAX] some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing Brueghel to discussing Millet's life and influences
- [TRANSITION] the transition between paragraphs is sometimes unclear or abrupt
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making them hard to understand
