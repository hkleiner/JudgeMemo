* [GRAMMAR] "the cemetery of the thing" is unclear and possibly incorrect
* [LEXICON] some phrases, such as "concert of regrets", may be less common or slightly awkward
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [CLARITY] the transition between the artist's health and her sudden death could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] the text jumps between discussing the artist's final work and her death, which could be more cohesive
