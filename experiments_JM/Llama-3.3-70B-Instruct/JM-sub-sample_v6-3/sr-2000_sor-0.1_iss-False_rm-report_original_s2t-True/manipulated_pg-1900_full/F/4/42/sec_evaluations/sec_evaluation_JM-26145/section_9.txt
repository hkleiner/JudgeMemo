Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "it by no means strengthened the authority of Egypt in Asia" could be rephrased for better clarity
- [SPELLING] "coulded" is a typo and should be "could"
- [SYNTAX] some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing the daughter of Napkhuria to political conditions in the Tell el Amarna period
- [STRUCTURE] the section lacks a clear introduction or conclusion, making it feel disjointed
- [CLARITY] some paragraphs feel like a collection of loosely related ideas rather than a cohesive narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
