Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] sudden, unexplained phrases like "A notification chimed twice" and "A tablet lit up on the table" and "A smart bulb changed color" disrupt the flow
- [LEXICON] some technical terms like "mini√© balls" might be unfamiliar to non-expert readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] abrupt transitions between describing the tunnel construction and the battle plan
- [STRUCTURE] inclusion of seemingly unrelated elements like "Outline of Crater" and "Course of Confederate Works" without clear connection to the narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
