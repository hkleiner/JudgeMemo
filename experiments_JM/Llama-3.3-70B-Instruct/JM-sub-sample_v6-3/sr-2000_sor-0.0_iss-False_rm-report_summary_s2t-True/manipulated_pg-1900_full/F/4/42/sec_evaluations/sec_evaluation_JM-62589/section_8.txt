Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the army was divide" should be "the army was divided"
* [GRAMMAR] "he must act promptly and wisely if he wished to hold what he have" should be "he must act promptly and wisely if he wished to hold what he had"
* [GRAMMAR] "in case he fell badly wounded,â€”he never forgot that" is a sentence fragment
* [SPELLING] "Shirtliffe" is consistently used, but "Molly" is also used to refer to the same character, which may be confusing
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between the battle scene and the council of war could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The story jumps abruptly from the battle to Robert's thoughts and memories
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or hard to follow due to complex syntax or vague language
* [TRANSITION] The chapter break feels abrupt and could be more clearly marked
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
