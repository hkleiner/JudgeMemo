        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder and enthusiasm of Christmas, but adults have lost some of that faith and excitement, and now often view the holiday as a time of indulgence and obligation. The author argues that this decline in the significance of Christmas is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. As a result, people have lost faith in traditional beliefs and principles, and the qualities associated with faith, like enthusiasm and sentiment, are now undervalued. However, the author argues that the core principles of faith, goodwill, and morality remain intact, and that the Christmas spirit, which embodies these principles, is still essential to human existence. The celebration of Christmas on December 25 was actually influenced by the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which symbolized the triumph of light over darkness and the renewal of hope. Despite the changes brought about by science and modernity, the author believes that the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas will endure."

Despite differences, people are coming together to promote social justice, which is the practice of goodwill and recognition of the brotherhood of mankind. The idea of universal goodwill is alive and thriving, inspiring many to work towards a better world. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster this faith in goodwill, providing a concrete symbol of an intangible idea. By participating in Christmas traditions, such as gift-giving and good-wishing, people can reaffirm their commitment to goodwill and mutual support."

While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and connect with others. The author also critiques the idea of replacing traditional Christmas celebrations with more modern or intellectual pursuits, arguing that festivals are affairs of the emotions, not the intellect. Instead, the author suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas festival is to focus on cultivating goodwill among people, which is a core element of the holiday's spirit. By doing so, the festival can regain its genuine significance and become more than just a perfunctory tradition."

Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those who annoy or challenge them the most. This can be done by using imagination to understand and sympathize with the other person's feelings and experiences. By doing so, one can build genuine connections and increase goodwill, which is essential for human happiness. The author emphasizes that this process requires effort, self-reflection, and a willingness to understand others, rather than just going through the motions of being polite or charitable."

As a result, one's relationships with friends and acquaintances become more meaningful and interesting, and even everyday interactions, such as gift-giving and celebrations like Christmas, take on a new significance. The author argues that this cultivation of goodwill can ultimately lead to an increase in one's own happiness. By practicing sympathetic imagination, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of others, leading to a more fulfilling and joyful life."
