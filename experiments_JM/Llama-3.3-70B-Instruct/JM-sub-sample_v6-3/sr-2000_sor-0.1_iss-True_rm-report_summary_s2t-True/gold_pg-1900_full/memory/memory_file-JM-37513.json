Spencer's essay outlined the concept of evolution, where the simple becomes complex through successive differentiations, and applied this principle to various aspects of existence, from the development of the Earth to society and civilization. The author was drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, leading to a higher complication and progress. Spencer's work had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and his contributions are still recognized today. The author notes that while Spencer's focus on biological relationships was a strength, it also led to a narrowness of intent and a failure to consider other important relationships."

Despite this, his philosophy had a significant impact, and he is remembered for his contributions to the concept of evolution as a universal principle. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the idea of a universal law governing all things, from matter to mind, and he believed that everything can be explained in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, he also acknowledged the existence of an \"Unknowable\" or \"Ultimate Reality\" that underlies all phenomena, which he saw as the source of all power and activity. This concept of the Unknowable is a central aspect of Spencer's philosophy, and it sets him apart from the scientific community, which tends to focus on observable phenomena rather than ultimate causes."

Bergson criticizes Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution from the fragments of the evolved, arguing that this approach cannot reveal the principle of evolution. However, the author suggests that Spencer and Bergson share similar views on the limitations of the intellect and the existence of a unknowable source of evolution, which Spencer calls the \"Unknowable\" and Bergson refers to as \"Life\". The section also touches on Spencer's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, but notes that his treatment of cause and effect can be puzzling. Ultimately, the author suggests that Spencer's thought is always underlyingly concerned with the notion of a noumenal source of phenomena, which is beyond human understanding."

Clifford, who argued that an exact knowledge of facts can supersede the need to inquire about their causes. In science, relatedness and change are key concepts, and simple types of relatedness, such as gravitation, can be expressed in formulae that describe the rate of change. The idea of energy as an active agent that produces change is also problematic, and a more modern understanding of energy as a constant ratio of variables is preferred. The author suggests replacing the word \"cause\" with \"source\" to remove ambiguity and using the term \"effective\" to describe modes of relatedness that imply certain changes. Ultimately, the concept of force can be understood as a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness, rather than an active agent that produces change."

As evolution progresses, new properties emerge that are not simply the sum of their parts, but are constitutive of the new whole. The author suggests that these properties can be correlated in a hierarchy of logical implication, with cognitive processes implying physiological processes, and physiological processes implying physico-chemical processes. Ultimately, the author aims to establish a strictly scientific interpretation of these relationships, with the goal of raising the level of understanding to that of the exact sciences."

The author also touches on the idea that physiological processes have specific relations that are distinct from physico-chemical ones, which is a vitalist perspective.

In the context of cognition, awareness is a characteristic feature, but it is still unclear what exactly is being awareness of, whether it be the cognitive process itself, the underlying physiological processes, or something else. Cognition implies a complex relationship between the organism and its environment, and is grounded in the constitution of the organism and its prior experiences.

Instead, the author suggests that cognitive relatedness is a complex and effective relationship between an organism and its environment, which involves awareness of various aspects of the external world. The author concludes that Spencer's work, although influential, failed to bring cognition into close touch with the rest of his philosophy of science, and that a more satisfactory approach is needed to understand cognitive relatedness within the natural order. Ultimately, the author emphasizes the importance of treating cognitive relatedness as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry, similar to other types of relatedness in nature."
