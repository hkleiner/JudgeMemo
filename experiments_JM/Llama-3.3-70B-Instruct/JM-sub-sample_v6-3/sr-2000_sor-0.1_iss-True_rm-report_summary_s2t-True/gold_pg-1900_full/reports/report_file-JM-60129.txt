Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a legend that their forefathers came from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and they have retained their language and some of their customs. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language and culture, but their history and traditions are not well-documented, and the team was unable to gather much information about their past.

Section section_02 (Chars 8356–16859):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögurs, a Mongolian people, live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and use Chinese household utensils. Their clothing is a mix of Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men wearing long coats and fur hats, and women wearing distinctive head dresses adorned with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and tea made with salt and butter. They appear to be in straitened circumstances, with limited economic resources and a lack of energy and enthusiasm, particularly among the young men. Physically, they have prominent cheek bones, short and broad faces, and small eyes, with some individuals having distinctive nose shapes, such as turned-up or "potato" noses.

Section section_03 (Chars 16860–24859):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people are described as being of average height with black hair and thin beards, and are known for their slow movements except when it comes to buying and selling. Their customs include burning the dead on a bier, with the ashes gathered and covered with earth, and inheriting property through the wife. Marriage is a significant occasion, with the bride being bought and the wedding involving a series of rituals and festivities, including the reading of prayers by a lama. The Sarö Yögurs also have unique practices surrounding childbirth and illness, with the lama playing a role in praying for the sick and the newborn. The author notes that the tribe's population has been decimated by unfavorable conditions, with deaths outnumbering births, although the accuracy of the statistical account is uncertain.

Section section_04 (Chars 24860–33012):
Section Summary: The author set out to visit the Shera Yögur Prince in the Nanshan mountains, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, who rode a small pony that kept pace with the author's larger horse. Along the way, they passed through a barren landscape with poor soil and coarse grass, and the author noted the lama's lack of endurance and energy. The author later prepared to visit the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'anglungssu, was delayed due to the late arrival of the escort, but they eventually arrived at the monastery, which was a collection of buildings with a large, colorful temple. The monastery was situated on the lower slopes of small hills, surrounded by grassy shores and slopes, and was characteristic of Buddhist countries with its decorated white conical towers.

Section section_05 (Chars 33013–41250):
Section Summary: The author visited a monastery in K'anglungssu, where they observed the daily life and traditions of the Yögur lamas. The monastery's temple was a large and wealthy structure with Tibetan influences, featuring intricate carvings, Buddhist pictures, and hundreds of Buddha idols. The lamas, who numbered only around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' customs, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-tellers in times of illness. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and taking in the scenic beauty of the surrounding mountains and valleys.

Section section_06 (Chars 41251–49022):
Section Summary: The author describes the appearance and demeanor of the lamas, who made a lasting impression with their expressive faces, kindly smiles, and traditional clothing. The author then recounts their journey through the mountains, passing by various rivers and valleys, and eventually arriving at the residence of the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs. The t'umu's dwelling is a simple wooden house with minimal furnishings, and the author notes that the Shera Yögurs are a small tribe with only about 300 tents, governed by a system of hereditary leaders and traditional laws. The tribe has a complex history, with uncertain origins, but it is believed that they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects. The author also notes that the Shera Yögurs consider themselves to be Mongolian and claim a connection to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language.

Section section_07 (Chars 49023–56548):
Section Summary: The Yögur tribe was originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors, and the current Yögur population is descended from six families sent to the area by the Chinese government. The tribe has diminished in size due to death and intermarriage with the Chinese, and they have a unique system of classification into "bones" that determines relationships and marriage eligibility. The Shera Yögurs are divided into several administrative units, each with its own temple, and they have a nominal head, the Ta t'umu, who has limited authority. The tribe has several distinct customs, including a funeral ritual where the body is left to be eaten by birds of prey, and a marriage ceremony where the bride is bought and the wedding is celebrated with feasting and festivities. The Yögurs also have a system of inheritance where only male descendants inherit, and daughters only inherit in the absence of sons.
