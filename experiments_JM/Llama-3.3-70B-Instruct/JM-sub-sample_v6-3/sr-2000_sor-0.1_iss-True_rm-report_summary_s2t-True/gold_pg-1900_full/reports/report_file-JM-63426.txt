Section section_05 (Chars 33650–42485):
Section Summary: The author developed a love for Caslon typeface and Old English Text, known as Caslon Black, during his time working in a print shop as a boy.

Section section_09 (Chars 68911–77585):
Section Summary: The author, Will Bradley, was recalled from retirement to improve the printing of illustrations in Chicago, but he believed the issue lay in the New York art departments. He submitted a report suggesting that illustrators simplify their work and focus on dramatic storytelling, but it was deemed too radical. Bradley later applied these suggestions to a new layout for McClure's magazine, which impressed the editor, but unfortunately, Mr. Hearst was not present to see it. The author reflects on the current state of design and printing, noting that young designers and printers have greater opportunities today due to advances in technology and typographic consciousness. He also looks back on his own career, which spanned many years and included numerous achievements, earning him the title of "Dean of American Designers."
