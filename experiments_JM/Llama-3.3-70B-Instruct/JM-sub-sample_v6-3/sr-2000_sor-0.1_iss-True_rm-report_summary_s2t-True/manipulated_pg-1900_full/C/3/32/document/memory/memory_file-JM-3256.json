        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point with two anecdotes: one about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase but doesn't truly appreciate the books, and another about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognizes the value of classic literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both light and serious reading, and that the key to being a bookman is the ability to distinguish between books that are truly meaningful and those that are fleeting. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, unassuming bookman who reads and appreciates literature for its own sake, rather than for social status or prestige."

The author notes that the only cure for this \"disease\" is total abstinence, but even then, the bookman may struggle to resist the temptation of buying more books. The author humorously describes the bookman's struggles and the impact on his family, particularly his wife, who often suffers as a result of his obsession. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to prioritize his collection over his family's well-being, revealing the depths of his addiction."
