Section section_01 (Chars 0–8338):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city in the west over a thousand years ago and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, which was collected by an officer stationed in the area.

Section section_04 (Chars 24843–33005):
Section Summary: The author set out on an excursion to visit the Shera Yögur Prince, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, who rode a small pony that kept pace with the author's larger horse. They traveled through a barren landscape with poor soil and coarse grass, and the author noted the lack of energy and manliness among the Turkish tribe living in the area. The author later prepared to visit the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author's journey to the Shera Yögur monastery, K'anglungssu, was delayed due to the late arrival of the escort, but they eventually set out and traversed a challenging terrain of ravines, icy rivers, and rocky hills. The monastery, also known as Rtangu rgonba, was finally reached, and the author described it as a complex of buildings with a large, colorful temple and surrounding houses.

Section section_05 (Chars 33006–41243):
Section Summary: The author visited a monastery in K'anglungssu, where they observed the local architecture, daily life, and religious practices of the lamas. The monastery's temple was a large and wealthy structure with Tibetan influences, featuring intricate carvings, Buddhist pictures, and hundreds of small compartments containing Buddha images. The lamas, who numbered around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The monastery's gegen, or Great Lama, was a child who lived in the mountains and only visited the monastery for special ceremonies. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and taking in the scenic beauty of the surrounding landscape.

Section section_06 (Chars 41244–49251):
Section Summary: The author describes the lamas and their traditional clothing, as well as the landscape and geography of the region, including the mountains, valleys, and rivers. The Shera Yögurs, a Mongolian tribe, inhabit the area and are governed by hereditary leaders called t'umus, who act as judges and manage the tribe's affairs. The tribe has a limited knowledge of their origin, but it is believed that they migrated to the area during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects. The author notes that the tribe has a unique culture and language, and they consider themselves to be related to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language. The tribe's history and traditions are largely oral, with little written documentation, although the author was able to obtain a document from the 35th year of Emperor K'ang-hsi's reign granting permission for the tribe to graze on certain pasture lands.

Section section_07 (Chars 49251–56899):
Section Summary: The Shera Yögurs and Sarö Yögurs are remnants of a tribe that was sent to a desolate area by the Chinese government, where they were provided with cattle. The tribe has greatly diminished due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element, with women outnumbering men and many families having few or no children. The Shera Yögurs are divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The tribe has unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage arrangements, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional practices. The tribe's administrative division and social structure are also outlined, with the Ta t'umu holding nominal authority over both the Shera and Sarö Yögurs.
