The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession: one who was uninterested and unprepared, and another who was enthusiastic and dedicated to making a positive impact on his students and school. The second young man's commitment to his work and attention to detail led to his success and eventual promotion to a leadership role. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, and notes that a pleasing and forceful personality is a key factor in inspiring and motivating students. By sharing these stories, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession."

To be successful, teachers should be careful when filling out application blanks, choose responsible references, and be honest about their qualifications and motivations. A superintendent's role is not only to lead the school but also to support and encourage their teachers' professional growth. Before starting a new position, it's essential to prepare and get acquainted with the school situation, as the author did by visiting their new town and meeting with the outgoing superintendent and board members. By being proactive and diligent, a superintendent can set themselves up for success and create a positive and efficient school environment."

The author shares their own approach to meetings, which includes holding sectional meetings for specific grade levels and general meetings with guest speakers. Regular personal talks with teachers are also crucial in understanding their challenges and providing support. By following this approach, the author was able to build a positive relationship with teachers and improve the overall school environment."

The author believes that student activities can be valuable, but they must be carefully supervised and not overemphasized, allowing for a balance between academics and extracurricular pursuits. Effective management of student activities can help develop leadership skills and promote a positive school environment."

These activities help to socialize the school, develop school pride, and teach students to work together towards a common goal. However, they can also be overdone and interfere with academic work, requiring proper direction and management from teachers and the public. Overall, these activities are essential to a vibrant school community, but need to be balanced with academic responsibilities."

A survey of teachers in the city schools revealed that they value assistance from principals in areas such as supporting exceptional children, interpreting the course of study, and providing administrative support. The survey also highlighted the need for principals to provide constructive criticism, emotional support, and a well-planned work environment to help teachers succeed."

Principals can provide professional leadership by offering concrete help, interpreting the course of study, and giving teachers opportunities for growth and recognition. Effective administration, such as furnishing supplies and equipment on time and providing definite directions, can also support teachers. Additionally, principals can build strong relationships with teachers by showing genuine interest and appreciation for their work, which can lead to a more positive and productive school environment. By doing so, principals can help teachers feel valued and encouraged, leading to better outcomes for students."

To address this, schools are implementing vocational guidance programs, trade schools, and part-time schools to prepare students for their future careers. Some schools are using club organizations and guest speakers to provide students with information about different professions and help them make informed decisions. Many parents and community members are unaware of the resources and opportunities available in schools, leading to misconceptions about the value of education. By working together, schools can help students adjust to a vocation and prepare them for success in life."
