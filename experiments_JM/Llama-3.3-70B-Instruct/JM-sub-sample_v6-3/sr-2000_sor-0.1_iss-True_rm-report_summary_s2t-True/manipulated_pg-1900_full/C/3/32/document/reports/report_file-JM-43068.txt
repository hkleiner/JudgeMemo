Section section_02 (Chars 8851–17509):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet was a philosopher-artist who focused on conveying the simplicity and hardships of rural life. His paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen" and "The Sower", showcased the loneliness and monotony of a peasant's labor, but also highlighted the importance of their work. Millet's art was not about technical skill or beauty, but about conveying a message and telling a story. He was more concerned with illustrating the human condition and the struggles of everyday life than with creating visually stunning works. Through his art, Millet aimed to make the viewer forget the painter and absorb the lesson, rather than being impressed by technical skill or artistic virtuosity.

Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to support his move to Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre and developed his own unique style.
