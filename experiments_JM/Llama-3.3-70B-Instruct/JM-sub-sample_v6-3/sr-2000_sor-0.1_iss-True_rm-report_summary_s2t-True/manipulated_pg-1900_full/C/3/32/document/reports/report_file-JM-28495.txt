Section section_01 (Chars 0–8227):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful, and they are even misled by a mischievous street boy. The couple then decides to follow a man who appears to be an official of the Home, but their attempts at surreptitious tracking are awkward and humorous. As they follow the man, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart.

Section section_02 (Chars 8228–16429):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife Stella attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but they ended up on a wild goose chase through the streets. The man eventually led them to his home, where he and his wife disappeared inside, leaving the couple exhausted and dogless. Later, while walking home across the golf course, Stella and the narrator found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and floating in a pond. They rescued the puppy and eventually named him Excalibur, or Scally for short, after deciding against other names like Tiny and Mustard. As Scally grew up, he became a loyal and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and developing into a unique-looking dog with a personality to match.

Section section_03 (Chars 16430–24714):
Section Summary: The narrator describes their dog Excalibur, who is a lovable but dim-witted companion. Despite being told to go home, Excalibur insists on following the narrator, and his persistence eventually earns him a scolding. Excalibur is a gentle giant, fond of children and babies, and enjoys playing with them, but his memory is poor, as evidenced by his forgetting where he buried a shoulder of mutton. This forgetfulness leads to chaos in the household, especially when the family is hosting a dinner party for the new lord-lieutenant and his lady. Excalibur's antics continue to cause trouble, including leaving his bone behind a cushion in the drawing room, where their guest is sitting.

Section section_04 (Chars 24715–32962):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on walks around the village, where he would visit with various shopkeepers and animals. Eileen had attempted to teach Excalibur tricks, but he was not very successful and often got into trouble. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, and made a mess, but Eileen's charm and apology helped to break the ice and introduce her to the curate. The curate was immediately smitten with Eileen and they began to spend more time together, with Excalibur often serving as a chaperone. As the curate and Eileen's relationship blossomed, Excalibur found himself being used more and more as a chaperone, even on the tennis lawn, where he would lie and sleep despite the commotion around him.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a gentle creature, often found himself in awkward situations while accompanying Eileen and the curate on their outings, including games of tennis and golf. During a golf game, Excalibur was struck by a ball and retaliated, but ended up getting hurt by the ball's elastic substance. On a country walk, Excalibur encountered a hare and later returned to Eileen and the curate, who were too engrossed in their own conversation to notice him. The curate and Eileen were discussing their financial struggles and the curate's decision to leave for London to find work and build a future for them. They decided to keep their plans a secret, enjoying the idea of sharing a special secret just between the two of them.

Excalibur was overjoyed to be reunited with the curate and caused a sensation in London before they traveled together by train. The train journey was eventful, and they eventually boarded another train after missing the night mail, which led to a dramatic accident on the Yorkshire moor.
