        "section_summary": "Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with a being known as proto-man, which makes him realize that humanity is not ready for the power of matter-transmission. He tries to stop Margot from reaching a black box that contains the secret of matter-transmission, but Garr Symm intervenes and jumps into the box, which transforms him into a primitive, caveman-like creature. Vardin, a being who is a guardian of the galaxy, explains that her ancestors discovered the power of matter-transmission but did not understand it, and it ultimately led to their downfall. Ramsey and Margot escape the planet, and Vardin disappears, leaving them to return to their ship and blast off into space. Vardin's parting words suggest that she will continue to watch over the galaxy and intervene when necessary to prevent the misuse of powerful technology."

        "section_summary": "The woman woke up from sleep and expressed her love to Ramsey with a tremulous smile. Her words seemed to catch her off guard, suggesting they were spoken from the heart. Ramsey responded by stating he couldn't return to Earth, implying he had found something better with her. The woman agreed, suggesting that going back to their old life wouldn't be desirable if it meant being apart. Together, they had a vast future ahead of them, with all of space to explore and a lifetime to spend together."
