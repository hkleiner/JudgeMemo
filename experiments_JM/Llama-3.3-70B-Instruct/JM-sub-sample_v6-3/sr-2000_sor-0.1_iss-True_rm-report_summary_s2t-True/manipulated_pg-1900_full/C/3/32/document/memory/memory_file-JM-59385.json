Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits this street with her grandmother, Madame Yen, and other relatives to purchase her dowry jewels. At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a reputable dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered a selection of precious stones, including pearls, which Madame Yen and Kuei Ping prefer. As they browse and bargain, Kuei Ping is drawn to the pearls and eventually selects a handful, which seem to glow with a warmer color in her hand. The scene is a pivotal moment in Kuei Ping's life, one that she will later reflect on fondly, and it marks the beginning of her journey towards marriage and adulthood."
