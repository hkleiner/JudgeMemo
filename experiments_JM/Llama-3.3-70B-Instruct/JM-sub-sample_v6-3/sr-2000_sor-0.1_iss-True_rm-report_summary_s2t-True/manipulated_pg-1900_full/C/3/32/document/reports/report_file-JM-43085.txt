Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature to accurately depict scenes. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier's early life was marked by a humble beginning, with his father being a dealer in colonial products and chemicals. Meissonier's artistic talent was apparent from a young age, but his father, alarmed by the tumultuous art scene in France, initially discouraged his son's creative pursuits and instead apprenticed him as a druggist. However, Meissonier's passion for art prevailed, and he eventually pursued his artistic career. Meissonier's approach to art was characterized by his devotion to reality and his refusal to depict scenes he had not personally witnessed, such as battles.

Section section_04 (Chars 25513–32783):
Section Summary: In 1840, Meissonier submitted several paintings to the Salon, including "A Reader", "Saint Paul", and "Isaiah", but the latter two were dull and commonplace, suggesting he was trying to paint in a different style to prove a point to his critics. Fortunately, he was discouraged from continuing down this path by Jules Chenavard and instead focused on his genre painting, "The Reader", which received praise and encouraged him to stay true to himself. Meissonier's subsequent paintings, such as "The Game of Chess" and "A Smoker", were highly successful and showcased his unique ability to capture individuality and character in his subjects. His work was admired by critics, including Théophile Gautier, who noted Meissonier's skill in composition and his ability to convey complex characters through subtle details. Meissonier's success continued to grow, with each new painting earning him increasing distinction and acclaim.
