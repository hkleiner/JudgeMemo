The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his father, Doctor Gordon, who suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he is overjoyed at the prospect of having a new pet. The story concludes with the family enjoying afternoon tea and discussing plans to visit Donald's uncle, who has invited them to celebrate his daughter Marjorie's birthday party."
