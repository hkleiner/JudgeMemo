Section section_03 (Chars 17404–26366):
Section Summary: In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, and any attempts at naturalistic art were met with strict scrutiny. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing amidst the rugged and picturesque landscape had a profound impact on his artistic style. Millet's family encouraged his early interest in drawing, and his father even took him to meet a local painter, Mouchel, to showcase his work. As he grew older, Millet developed his skills through self-study and practice, drawing inspiration from the people and landscapes around him, as well as from literature and the Bible. Eventually, Millet's talent and passion for art led him to leave his rural home and migrate to Paris to pursue a career in the arts.

Section Summary: Millet's artistic talent was recognized by Mouchel, who introduced him to the works of great artists through engravings. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his passion for art led him to continue his studies in Cherbourg and later in Paris, where he was influenced by the works of Mantegna, Michel Angelo, and Nicolas Poussin. In Paris, Millet briefly studied under Delaroche, but their styles clashed, and he eventually stopped attending the studio due to neglect and financial difficulties.

Freed from his obligations, Millet was determined to pursue his artistic vision, but he faced significant struggles to make a living from his work, which was not yet appreciated by the public.
