Section section_01 (Chars 0–7864):
Section Summary: The story begins with a description of Sweet Briar Gulch, a beautiful valley at the foot of Jones's Hill. Jim, a prospector, is struggling to find success in the gulch and is feeling down after reading a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability. Anne's letter explains that while she loves Jim, she cannot marry him without a secure means of support, and Jim is hurt and angry by her words. As Jim sits in the gulch, feeling miserable, he is interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who brings a welcome distraction from his troubles. Despite his initial irritation, Jim's mood is soon lifted by Bud's cheerful presence.
