Section section_01 (Chars 0–8494):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a barren landscape and eventually arrived at the village of Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people, also known as the "yellow Yögurs". The villagers claimed to have originated from a city in the west over a thousand years ago and had a distinct language and culture. The team visited the village temple, which was small and poorly maintained, and met with the lamas who lived there and earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood. The Sarö Yögur people had a unique culture and language, but their history and traditions were not well-documented, and the team was unable to gather much information about their past.

The origins of the Shera Yögurs are unclear, but they believe they migrated to the area during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and are related to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language.

Section section_07 (Chars 49622–57637):
Section Summary: The Yögur tribe was originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors, and later replaced by six tshi Huang-fan from Urumtchi. The Shera and Sarö Yögurs are the remnants of these six tshi and are considered irregular troops by the Chinese military authorities. The tribe has diminished in size due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element, with women outnumbering men and many families having few children. The Yögurs have a unique culture, with customs such as leaving the dead to be eaten by birds of prey and arranging marriages between families, where the bride is bought and the agreement is made by the parents. The tribe is divided into administrative divisions, with the Shera Yögurs having several "bones" and the Sarö Yögurs having their own divisions, with Ta t'umu considered the head of both tribes.
