Section section_01 (Chars 0–7881):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks for his help in writing a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for the periodical "The Middle". Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but later feels uncertain about its quality, especially after Corvick expresses his dissatisfaction with it. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, where Lady Jane praises the review and tries to get Vereker to read it, but he politely declines, taking the paper to read later. The narrator is left feeling anxious about Vereker's opinion of his review and unsure if he has truly understood the author's work.

Section section_02 (Chars 7881–16025):
Section Summary: The narrator mentions to Lady Jane that he is the author of a review, but her reaction is not as enthusiastic as he expected. At dinner, Vereker dismisses the review as "the usual twaddle", which hurts the narrator's feelings. However, later that night, Vereker approaches the narrator and explains that his harsh words were not intended to be hurtful, but rather a result of his frustration with critics constantly missing the point of his work. Vereker reveals that he feels like a failure because his "little point" is always misunderstood, even by clever critics like the narrator. The narrator is intrigued and eager to learn more about Vereker's elusive "little point".

Section section_03 (Chars 16025–23757):
Section Summary: The narrator is discussing with Vereker, an author, about the underlying theme or "secret" in his writings. Vereker hints that there is a particular idea or message that he has woven throughout his works, but refuses to explicitly state what it is. He suggests that the critic's job is to discover this secret, and that he has provided clues in every line and page of his writing. The narrator is determined to uncover the secret, but Vereker remains elusive, saying that his work speaks for itself and that he has already done his part in conveying the message. The conversation ends with Vereker encouraging the narrator to find the answer for himself, implying that the discovery will be a challenging but rewarding task.

Section section_04 (Chars 23757–31530):
Section Summary: The narrator had a conversation with a writer, Vereker, who hinted at a deeper meaning in his work, but refused to elaborate. The narrator shared this information with George Corvick, who became intensely interested and determined to uncover the hidden meaning. Corvick planned to investigate further, and the narrator warned Vereker that the information had been shared, but Vereker was not overly concerned. The narrator visited Vereker again, who advised him to "give it up" and seemed indifferent to the whole matter, but did reveal that the hidden meaning was a central part of his work. The narrator was left wondering about the true nature of Vereker's secret and whether Corvick would be able to uncover it.

Corvick and Gwendolen spent their time re-reading Vereker's works, page by page, and discussing their findings, with Corvick determined to uncover the truth without any outside help. The narrator visited them occasionally, and Corvick shared his progress, but also his frustrations and disappointments, as he followed false leads and encountered setbacks. Corvick's determination and patience were admirable, but the narrator couldn't help feeling that he was on a wild goose chase. Meanwhile, Corvick's relationship with Gwendolen was progressing, but their plans for marriage were being delayed due to Corvick's obsession with Vereker's secret.

Section section_06 (Chars 39463–47397):
Section Summary: The narrator discusses Corvick's decision to take on a task that is not in his line of work, likely to impress Gwendolen Erme and her mother, who opposes their potential union due to Corvick's lack of means. However, Corvick reveals that he is no longer engaged to Gwendolen, and the narrator infers that she may have estranged him. Gwendolen later shares news that Corvick has discovered Vereker's secret idea, which she believes will bring him back to her. She is ecstatic and convinced that Corvick's discovery is genuine, and she cables him to write to her about it. Corvick's response is teasing, describing his discovery as "stupendous" but refusing to provide details until he has confirmed it with Vereker.

Section section_07 (Chars 47397–55348):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend Corvick had traveled to Rapallo to meet with the author Vereker, and the narrator was eagerly awaiting news of their encounter. Corvick sent a telegram indicating that he had seen Vereker and was staying on for further communication, but the narrator was disappointed to learn that Vereker would only reveal his secret to Gwendolen after they were married. Gwendolen claimed to be engaged to Corvick, despite his earlier denial of any engagement, and the narrator was left wondering if she had fabricated the story to get what she wanted. The narrator was then forced to leave London due to his brother's illness and spent several months in Germany and later in Meran, unable to return to England and reunite with Corvick. This separation marked the beginning of a series of events that would test the narrator's patience and avidity for knowledge of Vereker's secret.

Section section_08 (Chars 55348–63359):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, was working on a literary article about Hugh Vereker's writings, but his sudden death in a carriage accident prevented its completion. Corvick had been engaged to Gwendolen, and after his death, the narrator asked her if Corvick had finished the article, but she replied that it was barely begun and only a few promising pages existed. The narrator wondered if Gwendolen had learned Vereker's secret, but she refused to disclose anything, saying "I heard everything, and I mean to keep it to myself!" The narrator showed sympathy and kindness to Gwendolen after Corvick's death, but her reserve and secrecy about the article only added to the mystery and allure of Vereker's secret. This secrecy ultimately fueled the narrator's obsession with uncovering the truth about Vereker's writings.

However, Deane's articles and writings never mentioned Vereker's secret, leading the narrator to believe that Deane was either unable or unwilling to share it. The narrator eventually confronts Deane directly, offering to make a deal with him for the information, but Deane claims he doesn't know what the narrator is talking about and swears on his honor that his wife never told him Vereker's secret. The narrator is shocked and disappointed, realizing that his assumptions about Deane's knowledge and intentions were completely wrong.
