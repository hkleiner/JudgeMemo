To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber and impressive sight."

The narrator then waited at the train station, where they witnessed a chaotic scene with soldiers and a drunken Algerian soldier, but remained calm and unaffected due to the desensitizing atmosphere of the war zone. Ultimately, they found a way to wait for their train on the platform, despite initial refusal from a petty official, and waited anxiously as the hour of 5 approached, when bombs were likely to be dropped."

The author visited several hospitals in the war zone, including the Hôpital Central, and witnessed the dedication of the nurses and the impact of the supplementary supplies on the soldiers' well-being.
