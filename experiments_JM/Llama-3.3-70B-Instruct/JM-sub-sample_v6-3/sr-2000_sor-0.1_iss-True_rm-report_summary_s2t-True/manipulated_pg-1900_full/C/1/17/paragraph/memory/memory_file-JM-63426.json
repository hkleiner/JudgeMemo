Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style that was bold, free, and exuberant. The chapter \"The Boy Printer of Ishpeming\" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, growing up in Lynn, Massachusetts, and later moving to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he developed an interest in printing and art. Bradley's early life was marked by curiosity and creativity, with a strong desire to learn and become an artist. Through his determination and talent, Bradley went on to become a pioneering figure in American graphic design, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire new generations of artists."

He starts as a low-paid worker, but quickly rises through the ranks, becoming a job printer and eventually earning a man's wages by the time he is 15. After saving enough money, he travels to Chicago to study art, where he meets Frank Bromley, a landscape painter, and begins working at Rand McNally as an apprentice, learning to engrave tints on wood-blocks. However, he soon realizes that designers do not engrave their own blocks and returns to his old job in Northern Michigan. He later returns to Chicago and resumes working at Rand McNally, where he learns about new technologies such as line photo-engraving and halftones."

This experience had a profound influence on his approach to typography, and he soon became a member of the Arts and Crafts Society of Boston. The author's use of Caslon type in his printing work, including his magazine \"Bradley: His Book,\" helped to revive interest in this classic typeface, which had fallen out of favor. He established the Wayside Press in Springfield, Massachusetts, with the goal of producing high-quality, aesthetically pleasing publications. The press's first project was a sample book for the Strathmore Paper Company, which marked a new approach to showcasing paper samples and helped to establish the Wayside Press as a innovative force in the printing industry."

He went on to work with prominent publications, including the Ladies' Home Journal and Collier's, and later transitioned to the motion picture industry. Bradley's work was celebrated in a 1954 portfolio, which was introduced at a luncheon sponsored by the Typophiles and Strathmore. The book about Bradley's life was assembled from his own writings, which were edited and connected into a narrative by others, including Peter Beilenson, who contributed to the design and printing of the book. Bradley's legacy is preserved in comprehensive collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Huntington Library, showcasing his colorful and innovative designs."
