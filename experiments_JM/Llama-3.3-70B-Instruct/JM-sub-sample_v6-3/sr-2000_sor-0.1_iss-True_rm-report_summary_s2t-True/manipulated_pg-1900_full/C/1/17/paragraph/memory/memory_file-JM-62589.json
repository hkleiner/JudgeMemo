Robert, also known as Debby Mason, was later found wounded and taken to a field hospital, where a young surgeon, Doctor Bell, took an interest in saving his life. Despite the odds, Doctor Bell nursed Robert back to health, and when he recovered, Robert revealed his true identity as Debby Mason, a woman who had disguised herself as a man to join the army. Overcome with emotion, Debby asked Doctor Bell to write a letter explaining her situation, so she could face the consequences of her actions. Ultimately, Doctor Bell's kindness and understanding helped Debby to confront her past and look towards a new future."
