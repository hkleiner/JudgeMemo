They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. After arriving in Battersea, they try to find the dog home, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful, and they are misled by a street boy. They then spot an official from the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they continue to follow the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart."

He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then forgets where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often cause embarrassment, as when he hides a bone in a cushion at a dinner party, but his affectionate nature makes him a beloved member of the family."

As they talked, Excalibur caused chaos, eating food and knocking over objects, but the curate was too enchanted with Eileen to mind.
