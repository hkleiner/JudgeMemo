        "section_summary": "Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a drawing master and her mother Sophie Marquis a music teacher. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After trying various occupations, including dressmaking and school, Rosa's father allowed her to focus on art, and she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which showed promise of her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to art, marking the beginning of her journey to become a successful artist."

She became known for her attention to detail and her ability to capture the anatomy and physiognomy of her subjects, which earned her recognition at the Salon in 1841. As her career progressed, Rosa's success grew, and she received critical acclaim for her paintings and sculptures, including a first-class medal in 1848. Despite facing challenges and criticism, Rosa remained committed to her art and continued to work tirelessly, always striving to improve and innovate. With the support of her friend and collaborator, Mlle. Micas, Rosa established herself as a leading artist of her time, known for her honest and sincere depictions of animals."

Despite her success, Rosa continued to study and research, often visiting slaughterhouses to observe animal life, and later assuming masculine garments to avoid attention while studying horses at a fair. Her paintings, including \"Ploughing in the Nivernais\" and \"The Horse Fair\", brought her great recognition and financial success, with \"The Horse Fair\" being acquired by a London picture dealer and later sold to an American owner. The painting's history is marked by various transactions and exhibitions, ultimately leading to its placement in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Rosa's dedication to her craft and her integrity as an artist are evident in her meticulous work and generous offers, such as her attempt to replace a reduced replica of \"The Horse Fair\" with a newly painted version for the National Gallery."

Her reputation as an artist had spread internationally, with critics praising her ability to capture rural life and the relationship between humans and animals. She traveled to England and Scotland, where she was warmly received and found new inspiration for her work, and later settled at her chateau in By, where she continued to paint with great energy and productivity. Bonheur's work was particularly popular in England and America, and in 1865, she was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the French government. Her appointment was personally conferred by the Empress, who visited Bonheur at her studio and pinned the cross on her jacket."

However, her participation in the Universal Exposition of 1867 was met with coldness from the judges and critics, who resented her long absence from France and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, where she was a demanding but kind teacher, and many of her students went on to have successful careers. After resigning from the school, she retired to her home in By, where she worked tirelessly to fulfill orders from England and America, producing many notable works. During the war of 1870, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity by aiding the suffering peasants and refusing to accept favors from the Prussian invaders."

Rosa Bonheur's life took a turn when her friend, Mlle. Micas, passed away, leaving her heartbroken and melancholic, but she continued to work with energy and dedication. She received the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour from President Carnot and later gained a new friend, Miss Anna Klumpke, who would become her companion and testamentary legatee. Rosa Bonheur continued to paint, producing notable works such as \"The Duel\" and \"The Threshing of the Grain\", until the end of her career at the age of 77, still enjoying robust health and retaining her artistic talent."

Her death was met with widespread regret and unanimous praise from the press, who celebrated her dignity, character, and talent. She was laid to rest in the Père-Lachaise cemetery, with a large and eminent cortège in attendance, including many from the English art world. The outpouring of respect and admiration at her funeral was a testament to her kind and admirable nature, which had earned her no enemies throughout her career."
