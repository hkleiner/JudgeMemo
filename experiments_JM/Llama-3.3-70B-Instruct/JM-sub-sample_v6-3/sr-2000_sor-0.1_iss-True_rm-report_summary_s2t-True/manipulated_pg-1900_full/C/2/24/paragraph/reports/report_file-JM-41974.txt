Section Summary: Veronese's painting, "The Wedding at Cana", is a masterpiece that showcases his skill in composition and balance, despite its historical inaccuracies and anachronisms. The painting features a mix of biblical figures and contemporary personalities, including the artist himself and other notable painters of the time.
