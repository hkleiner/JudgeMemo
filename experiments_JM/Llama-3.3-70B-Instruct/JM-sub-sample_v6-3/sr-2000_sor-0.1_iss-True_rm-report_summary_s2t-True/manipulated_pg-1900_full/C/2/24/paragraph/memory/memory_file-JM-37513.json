Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" introduced the author to the concept of evolution and the idea that progress is a universal law that applies to all aspects of existence, from the development of the Earth to the development of society and culture. The author was particularly drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, and that this principle is the underlying cause of progress. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the importance of biological relationships and the concept of differentiation, which he applied to various fields, including sociology, ethics, and psychology. The author notes that while Spencer's work has been influential, it also has limitations, particularly in its narrow focus on biological relationships and its failure to consider other, higher relationships."

His philosophy is all-inclusive, encompassing biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and is based on the idea of universal law and causation. Spencer's concept of the \"Unknowable\" refers to the ultimate reality that underlies all existence, and he believed that it is the source of all force and energy. Despite the ambiguity of his terminology, Spencer's idea of the Unknowable is central to his philosophy, and he saw it as the key to understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy is an attempt to provide a unified and comprehensive explanation of all phenomena, and his concept of the Unknowable is a crucial part of this endeavor."

Spencer distinguishes between the knowable effects of natural phenomena and their unknowable cause or source, which he calls the Unknowable. Bergson, on the other hand, draws a distinction between \"the evolved\" and \"evolution itself,\" with Life being the agency that drives evolution. Both thinkers agree that the intellect can only provide a world of symbols, and that the ultimate reality or source of phenomena can only be known through intuition. The section also touches on Spencer's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the universality of connection between cause and effect, and the notion of power or agency that underlies all phenomena."

In science, the term \"cause\" can be replaced with \"effective\" to describe the relatedness of things that implies certain changes. The concept of energy is also reevaluated, with some arguing that it is not an active agent, but rather a constant ratio of variables that describes changes in a field of relatedness. The author suggests that the word \"Source\" be used instead of \"cause\" to avoid ambiguity, and that the term \"force\" be used to describe a measure of change or a specific mode of relatedness. Ultimately, the goal is to understand clearly what these terms mean and to avoid misleading associations."

The author criticizes Spencer's philosophy for lacking a thorough analysis of the different types of relatedness in nature, and for relying on overly broad terms like \"differentiation\" and \"integration\". The author argues that a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between things is necessary to truly understand the natural world and the process of evolution.

The author identifies three main types of relatedness: physico-chemical, vital, and cognitive, each with its own evolution and new properties that emerge at higher stages. These new properties are not just the sum of their parts, but are constitutive and characteristic of the higher evolutionary products. The author argues that relationships are just as real as the things they relate, and that new modes of relatedness and properties appear in the course of evolutionary progress. Ultimately, the author suggests that a provisional unification of scientific knowledge can be achieved through a hierarchy of logical implication, where higher modes of relatedness imply lower ones."

However, Spencer later recognized the limitations of a purely mechanical interpretation of nature, acknowledging the presence of specific vital characters in living organisms that cannot be explained in physico-chemical terms. Spencer's view of cognition emphasizes the complex relationship between the organism and the environment, but his terminology and distinctions between internal and external relations are sometimes ambiguous. A truly scientific interpretation of cognitive relatedness is still lacking, and Spencer's work does not provide an adequate analysis of this complex problem. Ultimately, a scientific philosophy must deal with cognitive relatedness in a strictly analogous manner to other relational problems, without resorting to unscientific concepts like psychic entities or vital forces."
