        "section_summary": "Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and over 30 times those of the United States. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy and made it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat them. Russia's contributions were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan to quickly defeat France was thwarted by Russia's diversion of German and Austrian forces. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's sacrifices and efforts were instrumental in the Allied victory, and its role in the war should not be underestimated."

By advancing into East Prussia, Russia diverted German troops from the French front, ultimately contributing to Germany's defeat in the First Battle of the Marne. German General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to downplay Russia's role and slander the Russian Army, but his accounts are false and misleading. In reality, Russia's sacrifices, including the loss of the Battle of Tannenberg, helped to shift the balance of the war in favor of the Allies. Russia's actions during the early weeks of the war were instrumental in preventing Germany's potential victory, and their contributions should not be obscured by later events or biased accounts."

The Russian Army's victories, particularly at Warsaw in October 1914, forced the Germans to transfer 300,000 soldiers from the Western front to the Eastern front, abandoning their operations in France. This strategic shift compelled the Germans to adopt a defensive stance in the West for over a year, giving the Allies a significant advantage. Russia's efforts, although often underappreciated, played a decisive role in thwarting Germany's plans to crush France, and their sacrifices in 1914 ultimately changed the course of the war. By the end of 1914, the Germans were forced to triple their forces on the Russian front, further weakening their position in France."

In 1915, Russia's single-handed fight against Germany, Austria, and Turkey allowed France and England to prepare for the war and accumulate new reserves. The Russian front drew in German reserves, preventing them from being used in France, and ultimately contributed to the failure of the German offensive at Verdun. Ludendorf's own memoirs acknowledge that the lack of reserves, which were being used up on the Russian front, hindered the German army's ability to achieve decisive results. The Russian Army's resistance in 1915 prevented the Germans from exploiting their successes, and their bravery and sacrifice helped to turn the tide of the war in favor of the Allies."

The offensive led by General Brusilov in 1916, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of prisoners and significant trophies, forced the Austrians to abandon their offensive in Italy and transfer troops to the Russian front. This, in turn, allowed the Italians to launch a counter-offensive and relieved pressure on the French front, enabling the Allies to launch an offensive at the Somme. Russia's assistance to its allies continued in 1916, with the Russian Army providing support to the French during the Verdun period and later helping to defend Romania against invasion. Overall, Russia's military operations significantly contributed to the war effort and helped to shift the balance in favor of the Allies."
