        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by a profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Elder, who is now recognized as one of the greatest masters of peasant painting. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are infused with a deep understanding of the struggles and troubles of the peasants he depicted. His unique style, which is marked by subtleties of line and tone, is a result of his simple and earnest life, as well as his study of the Italian Renaissance masters. Overall, Millet's work is a powerful and enduring portrayal of peasant life, and his paintings continue to be appreciated for their intense earnestness and melancholy truth."

His artwork often featured lonely, laborious scenes, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", which highlighted the monotony and importance of rural work. Millet's unique style was characterized by restraint and a lack of virtuosity, as he prioritized illustrating his philosophical observations over showcasing technical skill. His art was not meant to impress with its technique, but to convey a message and evoke a sense of understanding in the viewer. Millet's approach to art was distinct from his contemporaries, and his work marked a departure from the conventional landscape painting of his time."

        "section_summary": "In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, making it difficult for innovative artists to break through. Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his art. His childhood was marked by a strong connection to nature and a simple, hardworking lifestyle, which would later influence his artistic style. Millet's early life was spent working on his family's farm and developing his skills in drawing and literature, with a particular fondness for the works of Virgil and the Bible. As he grew older, his passion for art only intensified, eventually leading him to pursue a career in Paris."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm to manage it, but he eventually returned to Cherbourg to pursue his art studies under M. Langlois. Langlois, who had a classical influence, tried to mold Millet's style, but Millet struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a modest pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a profound influence on his artistic development. Millet eventually placed himself under the tutelage of Delaroche, but found his style and teachings to be unsuitable, leading him to cease attending the studio and strike out on his own once again."

He eventually moved to Barbizon, where he found inspiration in the peasant life and landscape, and began to develop his unique style. Millet's early years were marked by poverty and hardship, but he persevered and eventually gained recognition for his work, becoming a regular contributor to the Salon. Despite facing many challenges, including the revolutionary turmoil of 1848, Millet continued to paint and eventually found success in Barbizon, where he was surrounded by like-minded artists, including Rousseau. Millet's focus on the peasant and rural life set him apart from other artists, and he became known for his powerful and emotive depictions of everyday people."
