With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a \"carnet rouge\" and is allowed to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as initially desired. The author is offered alternative destinations, including Meaux, which they visit and describe as a somber and impressive sight, with fields of graves and cemeteries. Ultimately, the author's goal of reaching the front lines, such as Amiens or Verdun, remains unfulfilled due to the risks and restrictions in place."

        "section_summary": "The author visited several military hospitals in France and was impressed by their cleanliness, organization, and care for the wounded soldiers. Despite some shortages, such as pillows, the hospitals were well-run and the patients were well-cared for, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the hospital wards and boost morale. The author met with Mlle. de Sézilles, the infirmière major, who showed her around the Hôpital Central and highlighted the importance of appetizing food and comfortable surroundings for the convalescent soldiers. The author also noted that the wealthy in France were not as able to support relief efforts as they once were, due to the economic strain of the war, and therefore relied on international support. The author appeals to readers to contribute to the relief efforts, emphasizing the gratitude of the French soldiers and the importance of supporting \"The Eternal France\"."
