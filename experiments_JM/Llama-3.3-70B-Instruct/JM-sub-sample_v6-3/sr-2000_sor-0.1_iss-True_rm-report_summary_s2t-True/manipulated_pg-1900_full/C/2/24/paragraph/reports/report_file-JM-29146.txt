Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–16056):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is confronted by Garr Symm, the new head of the Irwadian Security Police, who is drunk and hostile towards outworlders, particularly Earthmen. Symm insults and humiliates Ramsey, sloshing a drink in his face, but Ramsey chooses not to react, aware that he is in a precarious position as an Earthman fugitive in a foreign world. The encounter leaves Ramsey wondering about Symm's appointment and the motivations behind it. The situation is tense, with Ramsey trying to avoid trouble while navigating the complexities of intergalactic politics and prejudices.

Section Summary: Garr Symm, the Irwadian Security Chief, is a drunkard who is grossly incompetent, yet he holds a top security job. Ramsey intervenes when Symm mistreats a Vegan girl, Mith, and they escape together. Ramsey takes Mith to his room in the Old Quarter, but they don't plan to stay, as Symm will likely come after them. When they arrive, they find an Earthgirl waiting for them, who claims to be a telepath and has Ramsey's m.g. gun. The Earthgirl is mysterious and seems to know more about Ramsey than she should, and she teases him about his situation with Mith, who mistakenly thinks the Earthgirl is Ramsey's wife.

Section Summary: Ramsey is approached by Margot Dennison, a beautiful Earthgirl and tri-di star, who offers him a deal: she'll pay him 1,000 credits to take her through hyper-space to Centauri. Margot had previously been trying to get to Earth, but settles for Centauri after reading Ramsey's mind and discovering he's a fugitive from Earth. Ramsey agrees to take her, on the condition that a Vegan girl who is with him can also come along. After a night at Margot's apartment, she disappears, locking Ramsey and the Vegan girl inside, and Ramsey finds a cryptic letter in her apartment that hints at a significant discovery related to the origins of humanoid life in the galaxy. The letter suggests that the hyper-space pattern from Irwadi to Earth may hold the key to understanding how humanoid types emerged simultaneously on thousands of stellar worlds.

Section Summary: A dying man writes a letter to his daughter Margot, revealing his theory about "proto-man," a being who may have originated from hyper-space and populated the galaxy with humans. He believes that whoever discovers proto-man's secret will become incredibly powerful, and he wants Margot to continue his work. Margot enlists the help of Captain Ramsey, a spacer, to escape from Irwadi, where they are wanted for assaulting the Chief of Security. They work on repairing a old spaceship in a junkyard, planning to escape from the planet. As they work together, Margot reveals that she can read minds, and Ramsey tries to hide his thoughts and feelings from her, but she seems to be aware of his attraction to her.

Chind is instructed to plant a fuel supply, U-235 capsules, in one of the wrecks to aid their escape. Vardin uses a scintillation counter to find the fuel, and they successfully retrieve it, bringing them closer to completing their ship repairs. Meanwhile, Margot tries to uncover Ramsey's secret, referred to as "X", but he manages to keep his thoughts hidden from her telepathic mind.

Section section_07 (Chars 48296–56677):
Section Summary: Margot, Ramsey, and Vardin prepare to leave Irwadi in the spaceship Enterprise, while Ramar Chind and Garr Symm secretly follow them in the Dog Star. As the Enterprise enters hyper-space, Margot and Ramsey discuss the nature of time and space in this realm, where time does not exist and travel can occur over vast distances in a short period. Meanwhile, Garr Symm explains to Ramar Chind that radar works perfectly in hyper-space, allowing them to track the Enterprise. The Enterprise encounters an "eddy" or "shoal" in hyper-space, which causes the ship to lurch and sway, and Margot becomes increasingly uneasy. As they navigate through hyper-space, Margot's true intentions and destination remain unclear, adding to the tension and suspense.

Section section_08 (Chars 56677–64795):
Section Summary: Margot Dennison overpowered Ramsey and took control of the Enterprise, forcing him to land the ship on a mysterious world in hyper-space. Despite the ship's environment-checker indicating a lethal environment with extreme cold and lack of air, Margot is determined to explore the world, believing it to be the home of proto-man. Ramsey realizes that the absence of time in hyper-space could protect them from the harsh environment, and Margot intends to take Vardin with her to explore the world. Margot threatens Ramsey with an m.g. gun, but he calls her bluff, knowing that the gun is useless in a timeless continuum where time is required for it to function. Margot ultimately decides to proceed with her plan, intending to explore the world with Vardin.

Section section_09 (Chars 64796–72977):
Section Summary: Ramsey, Margot, and Vardin venture out of their ship and into a timeless world, where they experience a beautiful, otherworldly music. As they explore, the fog surrounding them begins to lift, revealing a black rectangular object that Margot identifies as a matter-transmitter, a device that could grant instantaneous travel across the galaxy. However, their discovery is interrupted by the arrival of Garr Symm and his men, who attempt to stop Margot from reaching the device. Ramsey intervenes, fighting off Symm's men, but is shocked when one of them dies from lack of air, despite the fact that time does not exist on this world. The group's actions are driven by a desire to control the matter-transmitter, which could have profound implications for the future of the galaxy.

Section section_10 (Chars 72977–77970):
Section Summary: Ramsey stopped Margot from using the matter-transmission device, and then Garr Symm used it, resulting in his transformation into a primitive, caveman-like creature. Vardin, a proto-man, revealed that his ancestors had discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall and regression to a savage state. Vardin, a guardian, had been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and with his mission accomplished, he disappeared. Ramsey and Margot, who had developed feelings for each other, left the planet and blasted off into space, ready to explore and enjoy their lives together. In the end, they found love and a new beginning, leaving their past ambitions and desires behind.
