        "section_summary": "By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy called for a two-pronged attack, with General Ulysses S. Grant leading the effort against Richmond and Petersburg, while General William T. Sherman marched towards Atlanta. Grant's army clashed with Confederate forces in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately failed to capture Richmond. The Union army then turned its attention to Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy, in an effort to isolate and capture the city, which would likely lead to the fall of Richmond."

The city's defenses, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" were constructed in 1862 and consisted of a 10-mile chain of breastworks and artillery emplacements. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates, led by General Beauregard, were initially outnumbered but received reinforcements from General Lee, and the battle continued for several days with intense fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces ultimately failed to break through the Confederate lines, and the battle became a prolonged siege of the city."

They attempted to encircle the city by targeting the Weldon Railroad, but were repelled by Confederate forces on June 22-24, resulting in a loss of 2,300 men. Despite this setback, the Union plan was to reduce Petersburg through a process of attrition, which would last for 9 months. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including coal miners, devised a plan to dig a tunnel under the Confederate lines and blow up a key fortification, known as Pegram's Salient. The tunnel, which was started on June 25, was a complex engineering feat that required improvising tools and solving ventilation problems, with the goal of creating a breach in the Confederate lines."

The explosion created a large crater, but the Union charge that followed was delayed and ultimately unsuccessful, as the Confederates rallied and poured artillery fire into the crater. Despite being outnumbered, the Confederates launched a series of charges, led by Brig. Gen. William Mahone, which eventually succeeded in retaking the crater and forcing the Union troops to surrender or retreat. The battle was a decisive Confederate victory, with the Union army suffering over 4,000 casualties, compared to around 1,500 for the Confederates. The Union army's poor leadership and coordination were major factors in their defeat, which was a significant setback in the Siege of Petersburg."

Despite some Confederate victories, including a surprise attack on Hancock's II Corps, the Union army continued to push west, capturing key territory and extending their lines. The Battle of Peebles' Farm in late September and early October further secured Union gains, but at a significant cost in casualties.

He chose to attack, targeting Fort Stedman, a Union fort near Petersburg, in an attempt to break through the Union lines and facilitate a retreat.
