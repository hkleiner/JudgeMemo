Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] typos and spelling mistakes (e.g. "thw", "rathrr", "lroclaiming", "wikl", "inextinguishable" is correct but "unworthy--or even debased" has two dashes instead of one, "inheritor" is correct but "equally available to all the earth's peoples" could be rephrased for better flow)
- [GRAMMAR] minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g. "What all such differing conceptions have in common is the extent to which a phenomenon that is acknowledged to completely transcend human reach has nevertheless gradually been imprisoned within conceptual limits--whether organizational, theological, experiential or ritualistic--of human invention" is a long sentence that could be broken up)
- [LEXICON] some words may be less familiar to non-native speakers (e.g. "tabernacle", "imperishable", "animating principle")
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] some paragraphs seem disconnected from the rest of the text
- [STRUCTURE] the text jumps between different ideas and concepts without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it difficult to understand the author's point
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
