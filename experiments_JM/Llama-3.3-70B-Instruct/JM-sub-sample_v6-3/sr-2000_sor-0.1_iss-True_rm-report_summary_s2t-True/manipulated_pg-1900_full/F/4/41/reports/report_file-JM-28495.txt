A street boy they ask for help gives them a mischievous and unhelpful response, telling them to "bite a policeman." The couple then spots an official from the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs and decides to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in awkward situations, trying to avoid detection while pretending to be interested in various shop windows.

As Scally grows up, he becomes a large, lumbering dog with a unique appearance and a humble but determined personality.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on daily walks, introducing him to various people and experiences in the village. One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, who was having breakfast. Eileen followed and met the curate, and they struck up a conversation, during which Excalibur caused chaos by eating food and knocking over items. The curate was immediately smitten with Eileen and invited her to stay, and they discussed their interests, including rowing and tennis. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself overworked as a chaperon, as Eileen and the curate spent more time together, including playing tennis on the lawn that Excalibur considered his own sanctuary.

Section Summary: Eileen and the curate shared a secret about their relationship, which they only told Excalibur, Eileen's dog. The curate was sent to a manufacturing town in the north, where he worked hard and wrote cheerful letters to Eileen every Monday. After five years, Eileen's brother-in-law fell ill, and the family had to make changes, including Eileen sending Excalibur to visit friends in the north, which was actually a ruse to reunite Excalibur with the curate. Eileen took Excalibur to London, where they met the curate, and after a day together, Eileen said goodbye and left Excalibur with the curate. Excalibur initially tried to follow Eileen, but eventually settled with the curate and they took a train to the north.
