        "section_summary": "Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and realistic style, which is exemplified by an anecdote where he had a squadron of cuirassiers ride through a field of grain to study the effects of cavalry on the landscape. Meissonier's artistic career was marked by a devotion to realism, and he never attempted to paint battles because he had never seen one and didn't want to reconstruct it inaccurately. His early life was spent in a humble environment, with his father being a dealer in colonial products and his mother being a fragile woman with an artistic inclination. Meissonier's own artistic talent was evident from a young age, but his father initially tried to discourage him from pursuing a career in art, even going so far as to apprentice him to a druggist."

Despite financial struggles, he continued to work on his craft, eventually exhibiting his work for the first time at the age of 16. Meissonier's big break came when he was commissioned to create illustrations for a publisher, Curmer, and his work on \"The Indian Cabin\" edition earned him recognition and acclaim. His detailed and realistic drawings showcased his talent, and he went on to illustrate other notable works, including \"Frenchmen Painted by Themselves\" and \"The Fallen Angel\". This marked the beginning of his successful career as an artist, and he was no longer in need of soliciting work, with opportunities coming to him instead."

Despite his thorough preparation, he was often dissatisfied with his finished paintings, and on one occasion, he destroyed a piece that others considered perfect. This level of dedication and self-criticism defines Meissonier's talent, glory, and artistic soul."
