Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and efforts allowed the Allies to prepare and launch successful operations, including the defense of France and Italy. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but Russia's participation and sacrifices, along with those of France, prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's role in the war was crucial, and its contributions should not be underestimated, despite its eventual collapse in 1917."

This self-sacrificing move by Russia played a crucial role in the outcome of the war, as it prevented Germany from winning a decisive victory over France. General Ludendorf's memoirs attempt to distort this fact, falsely claiming that he defeated a large Russian force with a small German army, but his own admission of the strategic catastrophe that resulted from the Russian invasion of East Prussia undermines his claims. Russia's efforts during the first few weeks of the war were instrumental in preventing Germany's victory, and their sacrifices were not in vain. Despite Ludendorf's attempts to downplay Russia's role, the facts demonstrate the significant contribution Russia made to the Allied cause."

The Russian Army's operations in East Prussia, Galicia, and Poland forced Germany to transfer 300,000 soldiers to the East, abandoning their offensive in France and delaying their attack on Ypres. This led to a significant shift in Germany's strategy, with Ludendorff himself acknowledging that the German front in the West was weakened, and they were compelled to focus on the Eastern front. As a result, Germany was unable to launch a major offensive in France for over a year, giving the Allies a significant advantage. Russia's sacrifices and efforts during this period were instrumental in shaping the course of the war, and their contributions were pivotal in preventing Germany from achieving a quick victory."

This, in turn, allowed the Italians to launch a counter-offensive and relieved pressure on the French front, enabling the Allies to launch a successful offensive at the Somme. Russia continued to provide crucial assistance to its allies, including during the Verdun period and in the salvation of Romania from invasion by Mackensen and Falkenhayn. Despite its own weaknesses and lack of supplies, the Russian army consistently came to the aid of its allies, playing a significant role in the war's outcome."
