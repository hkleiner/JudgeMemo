In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and provided insight into the administration and court of the Egyptian kings during the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had expanded Egypt's borders through conquests in Western Asia and Nubia."

Akhenaten's officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and the pharaoh's mother, Queen Teye, also showed respect for her son's new religion. The Asiatic provinces under Egyptian rule enjoyed self-government, but this led to internal conflicts and struggles among the native princes and chiefs, who were also affected by the immigration of nomadic tribes.

The Pharaoh's government was well-informed about the situation, but its responses were inadequate, and it often sent small, ineffective military expeditions to quell the unrest. The letters from Asian kings, including those from the Babylonian ruler Kadashman-Bel, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relationships and alliances, with the Egyptians seeking to maintain their prestige and the other kingdoms seeking to gain advantages, including gold and marriage alliances. The Egyptian Pharaohs, particularly Akhenaten, were reluctant to give away their daughters in marriage to foreign kings, which sometimes strained diplomatic relations. The letters also provide insight into the politics and relationships between ancient kingdoms, including Mitani, Babylon, and Egypt, during a time of significant upheaval and change."

Akhenaten's foreign policy also strained relations with Babylonia, whose king Burnaburiash felt disrespected by Akhenaten's lack of gifts and sympathy during a time of illness. This led to a decline in friendly relations between Egypt and its neighboring kingdoms, with Burnaburiash threatening to retaliate against Akhenaten's actions."

The Habiri people continued to attack and expand, taking advantage of Egypt's weakness, while the kingdom of Mitani was on the verge of collapse due to internal struggles and external pressures from the Hittites and Babylonians. Mitani's king, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, but the kingdom eventually fell and was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also met a swift end, with Napkhuria's death in 1370 B.C. marking the beginning of the end of his reform and the city of Tell el Amarna. The clay tablets were ultimately saved by being hidden in the earth, preserving a valuable record of the time for posterity."
