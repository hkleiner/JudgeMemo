        "section_summary": "In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear before him, despite Becket having been dead for 368 years. The writ ultimately led to the destruction of Becket's shrine and the erasure of his name from records, marking the end of the first phase of Canterbury pilgrimages. However, a new wave of enthusiasm for the site has emerged, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, some of whom take the traditional Pilgrims' Way from Winchester, while others use the railway. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors drawn to its historic cathedral and surrounding landscape."

In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and captured by the Danes, who killed many Saxons, including Archbishop Alphege, and burnt the cathedral."

Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Thomas Becket, who was killed by four knights on December 29. The events leading up to Becket's murder, including his return from exile and his confrontation with the four knights, are a pivotal part of Canterbury's history."

The news of his martyrdom sparked a wave of pilgrims to Canterbury, and his relics were highly sought after for their perceived healing properties. King Henry II, who had been implicated in Becket's death, later performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and shedding tears at Becket's tomb."

The shrine of Becket was completed in 1220, and its translation was a grand ceremony attended by Henry III and many ecclesiastical dignitaries. Over the centuries, the cathedral underwent further changes, including the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style, and it remained a major center of the English Church. Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of Becket's shrine, Canterbury continued to thrive as a city and a center of ecclesiastical authority."
