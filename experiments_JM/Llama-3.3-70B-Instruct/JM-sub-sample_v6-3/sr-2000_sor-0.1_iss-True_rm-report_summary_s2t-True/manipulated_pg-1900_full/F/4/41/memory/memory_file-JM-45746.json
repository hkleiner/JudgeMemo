The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession: one who was unprepared and uninterested, and another who was enthusiastic and dedicated to making a positive impact on his students. The second young man's commitment to creating a comfortable and attractive learning environment ultimately led to his success and advancement in the field. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with personality being a key factor in inspiring and motivating students. By sharing these experiences, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession."

With the rapid growth of high school enrollment, schools face the challenge of providing courses that cater to diverse student abilities and prepare them for various vocations. To address this, schools have introduced vocational guidance departments, trade schools, and part-time schools to help students adjust to proper vocations. By studying local industrial and commercial conditions, schools can offer relevant special subjects and encourage students to learn about different vocations. Ultimately, the goal is to provide each student with a chance to adjust to a vocation, and schools are making efforts to achieve this through various means, including vocational guidance and classification of pupils according to ability."
