Section section_01 (Chars 0–7709):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for the periodical "The Middle". Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although he is tempted to do so. Lady Jane eventually brings up the review at tea, and the narrator is relieved that she is praising it, which may help to impress Vereker.

Section section_02 (Chars 7709–15627):
Section Summary: Lady Jane shares a review of Hugh Vereker's work with him, marking the parts where the author has captured his essence. However, when asked about the review at dinner, Vereker dismisses it as "the usual twaddle," which hurts the author's feelings. Later, Vereker apologizes for his thoughtless comment, explaining that he rarely reads reviews and that even the most intelligent ones, like the author's, miss the true point of his work. He reveals that he feels like a failure because none of the reviewers, including the author, have truly understood his writing. Vereker's kind and sincere apology makes a positive impression on the author, who is touched by his willingness to connect and share his thoughts.

Section section_03 (Chars 15627–23206):
Section Summary: The narrator is having a conversation with Vereker, an author, about a "little point" that Vereker has written his books for. Vereker explains that this point is the central idea or passion that drives his writing, and that it is subtly woven throughout his works.

The narrator is intrigued and asks Vereker for a clue, but Vereker refuses to give a direct answer, saying that the clue is hidden in plain sight in his writing. The conversation ends with the narrator determined to figure out Vereker's secret, and Vereker seeming to enjoy the challenge he has presented.

Section section_04 (Chars 23206–30910):
Section Summary: The narrator had a conversation with Hugh Vereker, who hinted at a "buried treasure" or a hidden meaning in his writing, but refused to elaborate. The narrator became obsessed with uncovering this meaning, but ultimately failed and found that his search had ruined his enjoyment of Vereker's books. He shared his experience with George Corvick, who was intrigued and determined to uncover the secret, and planned to investigate further. Vereker later wrote to the narrator, asking him not to share the secret, but it was too late, as the narrator had already told Corvick. Corvick's pursuit of the secret, possibly aided by his love interest Gwendolen, may ultimately lead to a breakthrough, which Vereker seems to find intriguing.

Corvick and Gwendolen are deeply invested in the mystery and plan to re-read Vereker's works from the beginning to uncover the hidden meaning. The narrator is skeptical of their efforts, but acknowledges that Corvick has a special aptitude for subtlety and may eventually succeed where he failed. As Corvick and Gwendolen delve deeper into the mystery, the narrator becomes increasingly uneasy, sensing that Corvick may ultimately uncover the truth.

Meanwhile, the narrator's curiosity about Vereker's secret had been rekindled, and he was eager to learn more. Gwendolen sent the narrator a telegram with news that Corvick had discovered Vereker's secret, as indicated by a cable from Bombay with the message "Eureka. Immense."
