Section section_01 (Chars 0–8332):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating the village boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their houses were built in Chinese style, with most being fairly clean and well-maintained.

Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and use Chinese household utensils. Their clothing is a mix of Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men wearing long coats and fur hats, and women wearing distinctive head dresses decorated with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Sarö Yögur are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and tea made with salt and butter. They appear to be in straitened circumstances, with limited economic resources and a lack of energy and enthusiasm, but their condition is not considered extremely poor compared to other parts of Central Asia. Physically, the Sarö Yögur have prominent cheek bones, short and broad faces, and small eyes, with some individuals having distinctive nose shapes.

Section section_03 (Chars 16842–24839):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people are described as having black hair and thin beards, with average height and slow movements, except when engaging in trade. Their customs include burning the dead, with the ashes covered in a small heap of earth, and inheriting property through the wife, who must yield it to male heirs if she remarries. Marriage is typically arranged by parents, with the bride being bought and given a dowry, and weddings are the only festive occasions observed by the Sarö Yögurs. The people have limited knowledge of medicine, with lamas only called upon to pray in cases of illness, and childbirth is assisted by women only. The tribe's population has been decimated by unfavorable conditions, with deaths outnumbering births, according to the statistics collected by the author.

Section section_04 (Chars 24840–32983):
Section Summary: The author set out on an excursion to visit the Shera Yögur Prince, accompanied by a lama named Kuá, and was struck by the lama's small pony that could keep pace with the author's larger horse. The author then prepared for a visit to the "Yellow Tanguts" and obtained a letter of introduction from a Chinese mandarin, Ma-t'idu, who also offered a military escort. The author began their journey, crossing the river Heiho and navigating a stony and icy ravine, where they encountered Chinese workers harvesting trees and donkey caravans. After passing a guardhouse and a small Chinese homestead, the author arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, which was surrounded by small hills and featured a large, colorful temple. The monastery was a collection of buildings, including a temple and dozens of houses, mostly low and unpretentious, nestled on the lower slopes of the hills.

Section section_05 (Chars 32984–41208):
Section Summary: The author visited a monastery in K'anglungssu, where they observed the daily life and traditions of the Yögur lamas. The monastery's temple was a large and wealthy building with Tibetan influences, featuring intricate carvings, Buddhist pictures, and hundreds of Buddha idols. The lamas, who numbered only around 15, were friendly and obliging, but were initially terrified of the author's anthropological instruments. The author learned about the lamas' practices, including their reliance on voluntary contributions and their use of fortune-telling and prayer-reading services. The author eventually left the monastery, saying goodbye to the lamas and departing with the t'umu, Rentshen Nurbo, as their guide.

Section Summary: The author describes the appearance and demeanor of the lamas, who made a lasting impression with their distinctive clothing and warm smiles. The author then recounts their journey through the mountains, passing by various rivers and valleys, and eventually arriving at the residence of the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs. The t'umu's dwelling is a simple wooden house, and the author notes that the Shera Yögurs are a small tribe, governed by a few t'umus who act as judges and administrators. The tribe has a limited knowledge of their origin, but believe they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi, and have since become Chinese subjects. The author also notes that the Shera Yögurs consider themselves to be Mongolian, and claim a connection to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language.

Section section_07 (Chars 48980–56502):
Section Summary: The Yögurs, a tribe in China, were originally inhabited by the Hung maotzu or Huang fan, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors. The current Yögur population is a remnant of six families sent to the area by the Chinese government, and they have been greatly diminished due to death and amalgamation with the Chinese element. The Shera Yögurs are divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage arrangements, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional practices. The tribe is led by a nominal head, the Ta t'umu, but his authority is limited, and the settlement of taxes is not under his control.

Their traditional costume consists of a sheepskin coat, scarf, and Chinese-style trousers and boots, with women's head-dresses and hairstyles distinguishing them from men. The Yögurs live in tents, use Chinese domestic appliances, and have limited home industries, with their diet and lifestyle similar to other nomadic people.

Section section_09 (Chars 65072–73248):
Section Summary: The Yögur people's daily life revolves around caring for their cattle, with meals typically consisting of tea, roasted flour, and occasionally meat. They have a unique way of eating, using Chinese chop-sticks or chips from a faggot, and their meals are often accompanied by prayers and singing. The Yögurs live in simple, low tents made of a coarse canvas-like material, furnished with basic household items and heated by a fire. Their livestock, including yak cows, sheep, and horses, are well-suited to the mountainous environment, but the Yögurs have struggled to regain prosperity after suffering losses during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs also have a spiritual side, gathering to chant prayers at "praying places" in the mountains, particularly to honor the cattle god and ensure the health and welfare of their animals.
