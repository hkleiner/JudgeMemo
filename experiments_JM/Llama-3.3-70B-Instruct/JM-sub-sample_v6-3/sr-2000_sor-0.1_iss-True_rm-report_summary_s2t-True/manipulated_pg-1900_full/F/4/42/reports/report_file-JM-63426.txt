Section section_06 (Chars 42483–51244):
Section Summary: The author was drawn to printing on Strathmore papers due to their unique colors and suitability for Caslon typefaces, which led to a surge in business and the need for more space and equipment.

Section section_11 (Chars 86332–89797):
Section Summary: At the age of 62, Will Bradley retired to southern California in 1930. A quarter-century later, his work was celebrated with the 1954 Portfolio in the Strathmore distinguished designer series, which was introduced at a luncheon in New York. The book about Bradley's life was assembled from separate papers he wrote between 1949 and 1951, with some editing to create a continuous narrative. The project was a cooperative effort, with significant contributions from Peter Beilenson, who helped with design, printing, and editing. Bradley himself offered to develop the typographic plan and rewrite the text, but this was deemed unnecessary, as his original recollections already reflected his charm and candor.
