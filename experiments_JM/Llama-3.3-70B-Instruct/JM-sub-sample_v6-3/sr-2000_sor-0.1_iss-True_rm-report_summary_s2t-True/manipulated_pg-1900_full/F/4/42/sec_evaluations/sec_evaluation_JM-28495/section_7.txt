- [SPELLING] None notable
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the train accident and the curate's conversation with Lord Caversham could be smoother
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the accident scene to the curate's conversation with Lord Caversham
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the text are a bit hard to follow due to the complexity of the scene being described
