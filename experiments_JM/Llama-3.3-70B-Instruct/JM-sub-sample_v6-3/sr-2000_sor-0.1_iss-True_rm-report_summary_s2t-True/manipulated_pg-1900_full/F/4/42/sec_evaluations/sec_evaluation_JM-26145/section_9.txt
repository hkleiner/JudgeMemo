Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "it by no means strengthened the authority of Egypt in Asia" could be rephrased for better clarity
- [SPELLING] "coulded" is a typo and should be "could"
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the daughter of Napkhuria to the political conditions in the Tell el Amarna period
- [STRUCTURE] The section seems to lack a clear progression of ideas, with multiple topics introduced without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and unclear, making it difficult to understand the author's point
