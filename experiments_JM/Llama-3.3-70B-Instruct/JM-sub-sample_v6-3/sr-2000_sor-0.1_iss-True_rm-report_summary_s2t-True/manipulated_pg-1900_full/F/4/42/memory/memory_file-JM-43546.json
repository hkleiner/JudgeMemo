The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his father, Doctor Gordon, who suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he hopes to train it to be a sheep-dog. The family is excited to visit Donald's Uncle Alan next month for a birthday party, where they will celebrate and hear stories about sheep-dogs and their masters."

        "section_summary": "The Lindsay family and their friends, the Gordons, spent a week in Glasgow, taking advantage of the city's location to go on excursions and enjoy sails on the River Clyde and nearby islands. The boys, Don and Sandy, had a friendly debate about whether Glasgow or Edinburgh was the finer city, with each having valid points. The group took a steamer cruise around the islands, passing by famous ship-building yards and historic places like the Island of Bute and the Castle of Rothesay. They also visited the Western Highlands, known for its deer forests, wild moors, and scenic landscapes. The family's summer was filled with enjoyable trips, including a sail on Uncle Alan's yacht to the Isle of Skye and the Shetland Isles."
