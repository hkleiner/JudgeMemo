Section section_01 (Chars 0–7839):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for the periodical "The Middle". Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is not satisfied with it, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's work. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although Lady Jane later brings it up and praises it. The narrator is eager for Vereker to read his review and appreciate his understanding of his work, but is unsure if he has done it justice.

Section section_02 (Chars 7839–15616):
Section Summary: Lady Jane showed Hugh Vereker a review of his work, which she had marked with enthusiasm, but when asked about it at dinner, Vereker dismissed it as "the usual twaddle". The reviewer, who is also the narrator, was present and felt hurt by Vereker's comment, but later that evening, Vereker approached him and explained that his words were not meant to be hurtful. Vereker revealed that he is often misunderstood by critics and that even the most intelligent reviews, like the narrator's, miss the point of his work. He spoke to the narrator as an equal, sharing his frustration with being misinterpreted, and this conversation had a profound effect on the narrator. Vereker's words sparked the narrator's interest and curiosity, making him want to understand the true meaning behind Vereker's work.

Section section_03 (Chars 15616–23305):
Section Summary: The narrator is discussing literature with Vereker, who hints at a hidden meaning or "little point" in his writing that he considers the most important aspect of his work. Vereker describes this element as the "particular thing" that drives him to write and is the core of his artistic passion, but he refuses to explicitly state what it is. He suggests that critics should be able to discover this hidden meaning, but acknowledges that it has gone unnoticed despite being "shouted" through every line and word of his writing. The narrator is intrigued and determined to uncover the secret, but Vereker remains cryptic, only hinting that it is related to the "organ of life" and is not something that can be easily put into words. The conversation ends with the narrator deciding to think deeply about the mystery and try to uncover the truth.

Section section_04 (Chars 23305–31251):
Section Summary: The narrator becomes obsessed with uncovering the "general intention" or hidden meaning in Hugh Vereker's writing, but ultimately fails to find it and becomes disillusioned with his books. He shares his experience with George Corvick, who is intrigued and determined to uncover the secret himself. Vereker, however, regrets having shared his secret with the narrator and asks him not to reveal it to anyone else, fearing it will spoil the fun of his writing. The narrator promises to keep the secret, but notes that Corvick has already been told and may be able to uncover the truth with the help of his fiancée, Gwendolen. Vereker seems skeptical, but acknowledges that the couple's collaboration may eventually lead to a breakthrough.

Section section_05 (Chars 31251–39000):
Section Summary: The narrator visited an author, Vereker, who had a reputation for being moody and unpredictable. Vereker had previously hinted at a hidden meaning in his work, but when the narrator asked him about it, he seemed indifferent and impatient. The narrator shared his experience with George Corvick, who was determined to uncover the hidden meaning, along with his partner Gwendolen. Corvick and Gwendolen were enthusiastic and meticulous in their pursuit, pouring over Vereker's work and discussing it at length, with the narrator occasionally visiting them to offer his thoughts. The narrator was skeptical of their efforts, but Corvick was undeterred, driven by his passion for literature and his conviction that Vereker's work held a deep secret.

Section section_06 (Chars 39000–46996):
Section Summary: The narrator had lost touch with George Corvick, who had left England for India to work as a special commissioner for a provincial paper. Corvick's decision to take the job was surprising, and the narrator inferred that he was motivated by a desire to make money, possibly to win over his former fiancée, Gwendolen Erme. However, Corvick had revealed that he was no longer engaged to Gwendolen, and the narrator suspected that she may have estranged him. While in India, Corvick sent a telegram to Gwendolen announcing that he had discovered the secret to Vereker's writing, and she shared the news with the narrator, who was both excited and skeptical. The narrator was eager to learn more about Corvick's discovery, which seemed to have come to him suddenly after months of not thinking about it.

Eventually, Gwendolen receives a letter from Corvick, who has met with Vereker and is staying on to learn more, but he refuses to share the secret with her until they are married. Gwendolen reveals that she is engaged to Corvick, which surprises the narrator, as Corvick had previously told him the opposite.

Section section_08 (Chars 54927–62793):
Section Summary: The narrator was unable to meet with George Corvick in England due to his younger brother's illness in Germany, which led to a prolonged absence from London. During this time, Corvick began working on a definitive article about Hugh Vereker's writings, but before he could complete it, he married Gwendolen after her mother's sudden death. Tragically, Corvick died in an accident on his honeymoon, leaving behind only a fragment of his article. The narrator, eager to know if Corvick had uncovered the secret to Vereker's work, asked Gwendolen if her husband had finished the article, but she replied that it was barely begun and didn't reveal the truth. The narrator is left wondering if Gwendolen had gained insight into Vereker's work through her marriage to Corvick, but she remains tight-lipped about the matter.

Section Summary: The narrator returns to England and shows kindness to Mrs. Corvick, who is still grieving the loss of her husband. Despite her reserve, the narrator believes she may be hiding a secret related to Vereker's work, and he becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering it. When he finally asks her directly, she refuses to reveal anything, saying that the secret is her "life" and that he has insulted the dead by asking. The narrator continues to seek out clues, including reading Mrs. Corvick's new novel, "Overmastered", but finds no hints about Vereker's secret. Meanwhile, Drayton Deane, a friend of Corvick's, becomes a presence in Mrs. Corvick's life and begins to review Vereker's work, including his latest book, "The Right of Way", which is published as Vereker falls ill with malarial fever in Rome.

Section Summary: The narrator is anxious about the possibility of Hugh Vereker's death and the loss of the opportunity to learn the secret of his writing. After Vereker's death, the narrator waits for Drayton Deane, who has married Gwendolen Corvick, to reveal the secret, but Deane remains silent on the matter. The narrator is convinced that Deane knows the secret, but is either unable or unwilling to share it, which only deepens the mystery and the narrator's obsession. The narrator's frustration grows as he observes Deane's lack of interest in sharing the secret, and he begins to believe that Deane is too stupid to appreciate its value. Eventually, the narrator seizes an opportunity to approach Deane directly and offer to make a deal for the information, but Deane's response is unforthcoming.
