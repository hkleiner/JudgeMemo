Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "material dimensions in works of art are not take into consideration" should be "taken"
- [LEXICON] some sentences are wordy and use complex vocabulary, potentially hindering readability
- [SYNTAX] a few sentences have awkward phrasing, such as "It is because of this perfect proportion that it has been so justly said that 'Meissonier's pictures never look small excepting before you have really looked at them.'"
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing Meissonier's etchings to his paintings
- [TRANSITION] the transition between paragraphs could be smoother, with some paragraphs feeling disconnected from the rest of the text
- [CLARITY] some sentences are unclear or difficult to follow, such as the discussion of Meissonier's picture sizes and their relation to the artist's talent
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
