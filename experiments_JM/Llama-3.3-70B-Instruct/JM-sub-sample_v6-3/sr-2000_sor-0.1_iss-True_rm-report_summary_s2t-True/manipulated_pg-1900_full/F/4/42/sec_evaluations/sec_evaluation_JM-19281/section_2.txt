Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the development encourages a multitude of pursuits, both positive and negative in character" could be rephrased for better clarity
- [LEXICON] some words, such as "irreconcilable" and "antipathies", may be less familiar to non-native English speakers
- [SYNTAX] long sentences, such as the first sentence of the current segment, may hinder readability
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing the resurgence of religious interest to talking about the failure of materialism
- [TRANSITION] the connection between the ideas in the current segment and the context segment could be smoother
- [CLARITY] some paragraphs, such as the one starting with "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development", are dense and difficult to follow
