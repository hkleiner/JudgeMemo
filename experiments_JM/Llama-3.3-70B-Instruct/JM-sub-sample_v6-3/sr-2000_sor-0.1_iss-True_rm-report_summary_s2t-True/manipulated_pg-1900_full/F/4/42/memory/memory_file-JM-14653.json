        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views Christmas. Children still experience the wonder of Christmas, but adults have lost some of their enthusiasm and faith in the holiday. The author argues that this decline in Christmas spirit is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied."

        "section_summary": "The Christmas spirit has been impacted by the age of skepticism and doubt brought about by 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. This has led to a decline in faith and a loss of enthusiasm, spontaneity, and sentimentality. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, including faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are still essential for humanity to live with dignity and purpose. The celebration of Christmas on December 25 was actually influenced by the pre-Christian festival of the winter solstice, Yule, which symbolized the triumph of light over darkness and the birth of hope. Despite the changes in human understanding and knowledge, the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas remains a timeless and universal concept."

Despite differences, mankind is a fellowship of brothers, and the idea of social justice, which means putting goodwill into practice, is a flourishing faith. Having faith in goodwill and social justice is not enough, as it needs to be celebrated and expressed through festivals and traditions, such as Christmas. Christmas is a suitable festival to foster goodwill, with its spirit of peace and customs like gift-giving and sending cards, which can be powerful symbols of sympathy and brotherhood. By participating in these traditions with sincerity and imagination, people can reconnect with the spirit of goodwill and faith in humanity."

While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and embrace the ridiculous. The author also argues that attempting to replace traditional festivals with more modern or intellectual celebrations would be unsuccessful, as festivals are affairs of the emotions, not the intellect. To revitalize the Christmas festival, the author suggests focusing on cultivating goodwill, a element of the traditional faith that still survives and unites people across different sects. By emphasizing goodwill, the festival can acquire a fresh significance without overthrown traditional values."

Instead, one should focus on cultivating goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those who annoy or challenge them the most. The key to increasing goodwill is to use one's imagination to understand and sympathize with others, putting oneself in their shoes and reflecting on their difficulties and struggles. This requires effort and a willingness to set aside one's own biases and prejudices, but it can lead to genuine connections and a deeper sense of understanding. By practicing this kind of imaginative sympathy, individuals can cultivate goodwill and contribute to a more harmonious and compassionate world."

Regular practice of this exercise can result in a new attitude of mind, characterized by increased sympathy and understanding of others. As one cultivates goodwill, the \"superior person\" within oneself, who is prone to egotism and criticism, begins to decline, and one's relationships with others become more meaningful and interesting. This discipline can also lead to a greater sense of connection and companionship with others, making special occasions like Christmas more personal and significant. Ultimately, the systematic cultivation of goodwill can lead to an increase in one's own happiness."
