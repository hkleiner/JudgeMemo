Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature precisely.

Despite this, Meissonier's talent and dedication eventually prevailed, and he went on to become a successful artist.

Section section_02 (Chars 8444–16869):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and Léon Cogniet. He struggled financially, but found opportunities to decorate fans and create illustrations for publishers, which helped him make a living. Meissonier's big break came when he was commissioned to create illustrations for a de luxe edition of "The Indian Cabin", which earned him recognition and praise for his attention to detail and realism. His success with this project led to more opportunities, and he went on to create illustrations for other notable works, including "Paul and Virginia" and "The Fallen Angel". This marked the beginning of his path to glory, and he was no longer in need of soliciting work, instead, opportunities came to him.

Section section_04 (Chars 25482–32753):
Section Summary: In 1840, Meissonier submitted several paintings to the Salon, including "A Reader", "Saint Paul", and "Isaiah", but the latter two were dull and commonplace, suggesting he was trying to paint in a more traditional style. Fortunately, he was discouraged from this path by Jules Chenavard and encouraged by the praise for his genre painting "The Reader", which showcased his unique style. Meissonier's subsequent paintings, such as "The Game of Chess" and "A Smoker", were highly acclaimed and earned him numerous awards and recognition. His success was due to his ability to capture the individuality and character of his subjects, as noted by art critic Théophile Gautier, who praised Meissonier's attention to detail and composition.

Section section_07 (Chars 49163–52658):
Section Summary: Meissonier was a painter who went to great lengths to ensure accuracy in his costumes and accessories, often going so far as to collect relics from the Imperial Epoch he worshipped.
