They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief, including a street boy's suggestion to \"bite a policeman.\" They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart."

Exhausted and discomfited, they returned home, and Stella suggested that they should have considered the possibility that the man was coming from the Dogs' Home, not going to it. The next day, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a loyal and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and developing into a unique-looking dog with a \"rather badly stuffed lion\" appearance."

The dog's antics often cause chaos, including during a dinner party when his howls from the washhouse disturb the guests. Excalibur's daily walks in the village are also eventful, as he tries to make friends with other dogs, but is often rebuffed, and instead visits a rabbit and receives treats from the butcher and baker."

As they talked, Eileen and the curate discovered a shared interest in sports, particularly rowing and tennis, and Excalibur became a regular chaperone for their meetings. Over the next few weeks, Excalibur found himself overworked as a chaperone, as Eileen and the curate spent more time together, playing tennis and enjoying each other's company."
