Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "instructed to started" should be "instructed to start"
* [GRAMMAR] "and not to stop until he get there" should be "and not to stop until he gets there"
* [SYNTAX] "Was uncertain but that" is an awkward phrase
* [LEXICON] "aforesaid pedagogues" is an unusual term
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the pursuit of ladrones to describing the sleep and the journey back to the post could be smoother
* [CLARITY] The sentence "When we awoke the blazing tropic sun was past the midday mark of morning, shone full into our unprotected and well-nigh blistered faces" is a bit unclear in its description of time
