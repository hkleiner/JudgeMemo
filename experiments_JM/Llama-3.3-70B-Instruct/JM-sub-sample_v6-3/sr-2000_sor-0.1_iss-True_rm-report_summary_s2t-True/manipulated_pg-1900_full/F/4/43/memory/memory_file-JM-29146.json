He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the vital metal titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel."

Vardin, a proto-human, reveals that her ancestors discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall and regression to a savage state. Vardin has been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this technology, and with Ramsey's help, she has succeeded. Ramsey and Margot return to their ship, and as they blast off, Margot confesses her love for Ramsey, and they look forward to exploring space together. Vardin, having completed her task, disappears, leaving Ramsey and Margot to their new life together."
