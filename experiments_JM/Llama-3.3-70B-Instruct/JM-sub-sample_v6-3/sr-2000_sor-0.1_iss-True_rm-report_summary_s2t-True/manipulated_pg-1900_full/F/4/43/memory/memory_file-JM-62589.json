However, instead of rejection, Deborah's mother figure opens her arms and the two share a moment of healing and connection. Deborah and her mother figure then start a new life together, and Deborah eventually finds love with Doctor Bell, who is hesitant to propose due to her strong and brave nature. Deborah reassures him that she is ready to settle down and leave her warrior days behind, symbolized by the mementos she keeps in the attic. Ultimately, Deborah and Doctor Bell decide to spend their lives together, hand in hand."
