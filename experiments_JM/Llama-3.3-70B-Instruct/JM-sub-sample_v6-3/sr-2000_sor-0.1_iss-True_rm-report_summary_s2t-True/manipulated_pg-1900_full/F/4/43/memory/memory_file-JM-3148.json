Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful, true, or terrible is hidden in the strings of his violin. Davy and Anthony have a close relationship, and Anthony asks Davy to paint a picture with words, describing the landscape outside. Davy vividly describes the scene, and Anthony is then inspired to play his violin, producing a rich and harmonious sound. The narrative also flashes back to Anthony's childhood, where he struggled in school but found solace and inspiration in music and the outdoors."

However, he was actually passionate about discovering the world around him, asking questions, and learning through hands-on experiences. He spent his time exploring nature, collecting specimens, and learning about music, even inventing his own instruments and repairing others. As he grew older, Tony's skills in music and instrument repair became more refined, earning him the trust of the villagers, who would bring him their broken instruments to fix. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother, although sometimes perplexed by his ways, loved and supported him."

Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins. At the age of 17, he made a significant discovery - a piece of 80-90 year old wood from a rare maple tree, which he carefully set aside to use for making a perfect violin in the future. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. With his mother's support, Anthony continued to pursue his dream of making perfect violins, inspired by the likes of Antonius Stradivarius."

She was now the owner of the house and was getting used to her new life, although her appearance and reclusive habits made it difficult for her to win friends easily.

Despite Lyddy's initial concerns about being pitied and blamed for marrying a blind man, Anthony's love and acceptance have won her over. The two are now married and living a peaceful life, with Lyddy helping Anthony with his music by transcribing the notes he creates using a unique system of wires and wooden pegs. Anthony's music is a reflection of their happy life together, and when he plays a new piece, Lyddy and their nephew Davy interpret it as a celebration of the beauty of nature and the promise of the future. The music brings them joy and closeness, and they cherish their life together, filled with love, hope, and happiness."
