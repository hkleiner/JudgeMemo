Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to assist a friend, Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator agrees to write the review and is eager to meet Vereker, who will be attending a gathering at Bridges, where the narrator has also been invited. At the gathering, the narrator tries to draw Vereker's attention to his review, but is unsuccessful until Lady Jane mentions it during tea, praising the \"sweet little truths\" it contains. The narrator is relieved that Lady Jane has brought up the review, as he had been trying to find a way to mention it to Vereker himself."

Vereker revealed that he had long been frustrated by critics' inability to understand his writing, and that the narrator's review, despite its cleverness, was no exception. The narrator was touched by Vereker's kind and humble words, and felt a sense of relief and newfound respect for the author. Vereker's apology and explanation marked a turning point in their interaction, as he began to open up to the narrator about his writing and his feelings about criticism."

However, the man claims he has no knowledge of the secret, and the narrator is shocked to discover that Mrs. Deane never shared it with him. The narrator realizes that Mrs. Deane must not have thought her husband worthy of trusting with the secret, which is a surprising revelation given that she married him. The narrator shares his own story of searching for the secret with the man, who becomes increasingly curious and desirous of knowing the truth. The two men are now united in their unfulfilled desire to uncover Vereker's secret."
