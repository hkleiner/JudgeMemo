They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the dog home, but their attempts at getting directions are thwarted, including a humorous encounter with a mischievous street boy. The couple then spots a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decides to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to the dog home. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and comical."

After their unsuccessful adventure, they decided to advertise for a dog instead. However, their plans changed when they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick by a string near a pond on the golf course. The puppy was rescued and eventually named Excalibur, or Scally for short, after a suggestion from the narrator's sister-in-law Eileen. As Scally grew up, he developed into a unique-looking dog with a humble and persistent personality."

Despite being told to go home, Excalibur insists on following the narrator, and his persistence eventually earns him a scolding. Excalibur is a gentle giant, fond of children and babies, and is often the subject of playful games and activities. He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then forgets where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often cause embarrassment, as when he hides a bone in a cushion at a dinner party, but his affectionate nature makes him a beloved member of the family."
