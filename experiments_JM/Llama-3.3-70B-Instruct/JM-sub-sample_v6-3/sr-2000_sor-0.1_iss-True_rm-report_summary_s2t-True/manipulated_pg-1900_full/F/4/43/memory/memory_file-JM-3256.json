        "section_summary": "The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books as a status symbol. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognized the value of classic literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen due to their wealth or education, but lack a genuine love for reading and literature. Ultimately, the author suggests that a true bookman is one who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless classics that remain relevant and meaningful."

He believes that a true classic is a book that has wisdom, a timeless style, and can be appreciated by many generations. In contrast to popular opinion, the bookman thinks that the most enjoyable kind of literature is the essay, and he has a special fondness for writers like Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey. He is not concerned with seeking accurate information, but rather with finding writers who can tell him something new and interesting in a beautiful and lively way. The bookman's love affair with literature begins with classic novels like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\", which remain his first loves and introduce him to the joy of reading."

As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works have remained a staple in their library of fiction. The author notes that these classic authors have a timeless appeal, offering a welcome respite from modern novels with a purpose, and that their works continue to be a source of pleasure and inspiration. In particular, the author highlights the mastery of Balzac and the enduring charm of Thackeray's \"Henry Esmond\" and Scott's \"Heart of Midlothian\", which they revisit annually. These classic works have a lasting impact on the author, evoking powerful memories and emotions that remain vivid to this day."

The author then shifts to discussing the joys of being a bookman, rearranging books on shelves, and spending time in a library surrounded by favorite authors and titles. The author imagines a holiday where they can spend a week in their library, free from distractions, and surrounded by books and a beautiful garden. The author also fantasizes about hosting a meeting of fellow bookmen, including historical figures like Cosmo Medici and Charles Lamb, to share their passion for books."

The author notes that a bookman's wife often suffers as a result of his obsession and may try to intervene, but the bookman's desire for new acquisitions can be too strong to resist. The author humorously describes the bookman's struggles to resist temptation, including making a pledge to abstain from buying rare books, but ultimately succumbing to his desires. The section is a lighthearted and relatable portrayal of the joys and pitfalls of being a book lover."
