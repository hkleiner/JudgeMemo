Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" revealed the underlying law of evolution, where the simple develops into the complex through successive differentiations. The author was drawn to Spencer's idea that every active force produces more than one change, leading to a higher complication and progress. Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy, which encompassed biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, was groundbreaking and original, with experts like Charles Darwin and William James praising his work. However, Spencer's rigid focus on biological relationships sometimes led him to overlook other important relationships, but his contributions to various fields remain significant."

Despite this, his philosophy had a significant impact on the development of thought, particularly in the areas of evolution and the universality of law. Spencer's philosophy emphasized the idea of evolution as a universal principle, governed by the persistence of force, which he saw as the ultimate basis of all enforcement. However, his concept of the \"Unknowable\" - the ultimate reality that underlies all phenomena - is seen as problematic, as it implies a positive assertion about something that is, by definition, beyond human knowledge. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy attempts to unify knowledge and interpret all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force, but his ideas about the Unknowable remain a subject of debate and criticism."

Bergson, and how this relates to the philosophies of Herbert Spencer and Bergson. Both Spencer and Bergson believe that the ultimate source of evolution is unknowable by the intellect, with Spencer referring to it as the \"Unknowable\" and Bergson calling it \"Life\". Bergson criticizes Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution from the fragments of the evolved, arguing that this approach cannot reveal the principle of evolution. Despite their differences, both thinkers seek to understand the source of phenomena, with Spencer's philosophy emphasizing the concept of a noumenal source that underlies all phenomena. Ultimately, the discussion highlights the complexities and challenges of understanding the nature of cause and effect in philosophical and scientific inquiry."

Clifford, who argued that an exact knowledge of facts can supersede the need to inquire about their causes. In science, the focus is on understanding the relatedness of things and how changes occur within systems, rather than seeking a cause or force behind the change. The idea of energy, for example, can be understood as a constant ratio of variables, rather than an active agent that produces change. The distinction between cause and conditions is also problematic, with some philosophers, like Mill, arguing that the cause is the sum total of all conditions, both positive and negative. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the meaning of these concepts and remove ambiguity in order to better understand the world and the changes that occur within it."

The author criticizes Herbert Spencer's work for lacking a thorough analysis of the different types of relatedness in nature, relying on general terms like \"differentiation\" and \"integration\" without providing a clear understanding of how they are connected. The author argues that a more nuanced understanding of relatedness is necessary to explain evolutionary progress and the emergence of complex relationships in the natural world. Ultimately, the author seeks a more comprehensive and unified philosophy of science that accounts for the specific modes of relatedness that characterize different stages of evolution."

Cognition, or knowledge in the proper sense, is a mode of relatedness that emerged at some stage of evolution and is dependent on underlying physiological and physico-chemical processes.

Instead, the author suggests that cognitive relatedness is a complex and effective relationship between an organism and its environment, which is not reciprocal and implies changes in the system. The author concludes that Spencer's work, despite its limitations, was influential and significant, and that his commitment to uttering the truth he saw, even if unpopular, is admirable.
