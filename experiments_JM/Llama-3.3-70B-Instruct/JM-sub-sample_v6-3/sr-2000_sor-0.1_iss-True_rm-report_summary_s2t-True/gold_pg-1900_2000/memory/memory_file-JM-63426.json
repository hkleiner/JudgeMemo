        "section_summary": "The introduction to Will Bradley's chap book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts, bringing a fresh and modern style to a field that was previously stagnant. Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style, characterized by bold and free typography. The chapter \"The Boy Printer of Ishpeming\" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, from his early days in Lynn, Massachusetts, to his move to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he developed a passion for art and printing. Bradley's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but he was driven by a desire to become an artist and was supported by his family. Through his determination and talent, Bradley went on to become a pioneering figure in American graphic design, leaving a lasting legacy in the field."

        "section_summary": "The narrator, a young boy, is expelled from school for not knowing an arithmetic answer and instead goes to work at the Iron Agitator newspaper office, owned by George A. Newett. He starts by washing the press and learning to feed it, earning three dollars a week, which later increases to six dollars. As he gains experience, he takes on more responsibilities, including setting jobs and operating the press, and his wages increase accordingly. The narrator eventually leaves the Iron Agitator for a competing newspaper, the Peninsula Record, for a higher wage, but later returns to the Iron Agitator, where he becomes a job printer and eventually a foreman, earning a man's wages by the time he is 15. The narrator's time at the Iron Agitator is marked by hard work, learning, and exposure to the challenges of small-town life, including traveling fakers who prey on local merchants."
