        "section_summary": "In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to the Egyptian court and administration. The tablets also revealed the complex system of writing and diplomacy used by the ancient Egyptians and their counterparts in Asia, with scribes using various languages and scripts to communicate."

        "section_summary": "The life of King Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, is not well understood, but it is believed that he intended to reform the Egyptian religion and reduce the power of the priests of Amon in Thebes. He introduced a new doctrine, known as \"the doctrine,\" which emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, or Aten, and led to a break with the old religion. The king and his officials, including those in Syria and Palestine, began to use new names and titles that reflected their allegiance to Aten, and a new capital city, Akhet-Aten, was built to serve as the center of the new religion. The Aten dogma represented a shift towards monotheism and was based on natural phenomena, but its impact on Egyptian society is not fully understood. The king rewarded his officials who accepted the new doctrine, and they played important roles in the administration of Egypt and its territories."
