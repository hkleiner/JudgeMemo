Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, and have a language that resembles Khirgis and Turkish. The village has a small, poorly used temple, and the lamas earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, with minimal contributions from the villagers. The local administration is overseen by a pykh and his assistant, who collect a yearly tax of thirteen horses from the villages of Machuangtzu, Tungheitzu, and Yumashan for the Chinese government.

Section section_02 (Chars 8356–12747):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people's homes were traditionally furnished with Chinese-style sleeping stoves, Buddhist altars, and brick fireplaces for preparing tea. Their household utensils and clothing were also largely of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences. The women's traditional head dresses were particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Yögur people engaged in basic handicrafts such as weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men making baskets and knitting stockings. Their woven cloth was one of their few saleable items, which they would sell in nearby markets.
