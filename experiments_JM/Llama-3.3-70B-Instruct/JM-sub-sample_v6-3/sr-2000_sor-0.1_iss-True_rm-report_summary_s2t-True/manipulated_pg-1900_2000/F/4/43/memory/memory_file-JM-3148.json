Uncle Tony, who is blind, is a skilled violinist and believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his violin. Davy is tasked with feeding the chickens and then describes the sunset to his uncle, who is inspired to play his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony. Uncle Tony's past is revealed, showing that he hated school as a child and found solace in the outdoors and music, often creating his own instruments from everyday objects.

        "section_summary": "The teacher often struggled to keep her students engaged, especially on hot afternoons, and Anthony would sometimes sneak out of the window to snap a tuning fork and then return to his seat. Despite being considered the laziest boy in the village, Anthony was actually intensely curious and industrious when it came to learning about the world around him. He was constantly asking questions about the natural world, seeking to understand the underlying laws and principles that governed it. Anthony's curiosity and love of learning led him to acquire a wealth of knowledge about the natural world, including the locations of rare flowers and the songs of wild birds. He spent much of his free time exploring the woods, observing and learning from the natural world, and developing his own unique interests and passions."
