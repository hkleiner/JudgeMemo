Debby is defiant and refuses to obey Mrs. Lane's orders, including a ban on speaking to her friend Jack Martin. As a result, Debby is physically punished and sent to her room, where she spends the day thinking about her mother and her absent father, wondering if he may have been involved in the battles at Lexington or Bunker Hill. Debby's thoughts are filled with resentment towards Mrs. Lane and the King, whom she hates simply because her mistress worships him. As the day comes to a close, Debby awaits Mrs. Lane's return, expecting further punishment and conflict."
