        "section_summary": "Jean Honoré Fragonard was born in 1732 in Grasse, a small town in southern France, to a glovemaker and his wife. The town was far removed from the fashionable and scandalous world of Paris, and Fragonard grew up surrounded by the natural beauty of the Mediterranean landscape. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and news from Paris, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour as the king's mistress and her influence on the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a career in painting, encouraged by his master who recognized his talent. Fragonard's early life in Grasse and his exposure to the beauty of nature would later influence his artistic style and themes."

        "section_summary": "In 1747, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, after reviewing the boy's sketches, advised him to train with Chardin, a master of still-life painting, to improve his skills. However, Fragonard made little progress with Chardin and was eventually sent away, leading him to develop his skills on his own by copying masterpieces from churches in Paris. After six months, Fragonard returned to Boucher and was accepted as a student, working on enlargements of Boucher's paintings for tapestries. This training ultimately helped Fragonard win the coveted Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting \"Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols.\""
