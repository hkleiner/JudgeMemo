Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that he will have to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. The planetarization is a move by the Irwadian government to monopolize the trade of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also affected by the planetarization and is struggling financially. The two pilots discuss their situation, and Ramsey offers to help Englander out with some credits, trying to help his friend in a difficult time."

Englander is grateful and promises to use the money wisely, while Ramsey heads out to a gambling hall, hoping to have a lucky night. However, his luck is bad, and he loses most of his money, leaving him with only three credits. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, dressed in flashy jewelry, arrives at the table and starts insulting Ramsey, blaming outworlders like him for bringing poverty and trouble to Irwadi. The situation becomes tense, with the Irwadian telling Ramsey to leave the establishment."
