        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has lost its magic and excitement for adults, who now have to force themselves to enjoy the holiday. In contrast, children still experience the thrill and wonder of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what keeps the spirit of the holiday alive. The author argues that Christmas was not always a children's holiday, but was once a deeply meaningful and enjoyable celebration for adults as well. The fact that children still believe in the magic of Christmas suggests that it was once a powerful and significant holiday for adults, who have since lost their sense of wonder and enthusiasm. The author sets out to explore the reasons behind this decline in the significance of Christmas."

        "section_summary": "The traditional Christmas spirit has been lost among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. Their discoveries led to an age of doubt and skepticism, causing people to question long-held beliefs and ultimately losing faith in principles and ideals. However, the core principles of Christmas, such as goodwill and charity, remain intact and are essential to humanity. Despite the decline of traditional beliefs, people still instinctively try to keep the Christmas spirit alive, suggesting that it holds a deeper significance. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit has not been lost, but rather, it has been reevaluated in the face of scientific discoveries and changing beliefs."
