Section section_01 (Chars 0–8144):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point with anecdotes, including a visit to a wealthy man's library, where the books are kept behind glass doors, and a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary training, instinctively recognizes the classics of English literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both light and serious reading, and that the key to being a bookman is the ability to distinguish between books that are truly meaningful and those that are fleeting. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, unassuming bookman who reads for pleasure and has a deep understanding of literature, over the pretentious collector or critic.

Section section_02 (Chars 8144–11574):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and truly great. A true classic is one that has enriched the human mind, spoken to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcended the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire and educate generations. The author believes that a book's subject matter is secondary to its literary quality, and a true book lover can appreciate great works from various perspectives and genres. Ultimately, the author values books that have a lasting impact and are worthy of repeated reading and study.
