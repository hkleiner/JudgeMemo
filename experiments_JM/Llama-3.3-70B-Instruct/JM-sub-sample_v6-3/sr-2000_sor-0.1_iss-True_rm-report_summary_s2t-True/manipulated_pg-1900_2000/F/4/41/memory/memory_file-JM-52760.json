Despite numerous attempts, Union forces had failed to defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of General Ulysses S. Grant, who launched a two-pronged attack on the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. Grant's army clashed with Lee's in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately failed to capture Richmond. The Union army then turned its attention to Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy, in an effort to isolate and capture the city, which would likely lead to the fall of Richmond."

The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" was constructed, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line had weaknesses and required more troops to defend it than were available, making it vulnerable to attack. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, began to move towards Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps arriving on the scene on June 15, outnumbering the Confederate forces under General Beauregard."
