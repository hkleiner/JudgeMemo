        "section_summary": "The author recounts how they became a teacher by chance, without a clear aspiration or preparation, which was a common experience among their peers. The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who treated it as a mere job and another who made it a profession, demonstrating a genuine interest in education and a willingness to improve. The latter young man's enthusiasm and dedication led to his success, eventually becoming the head of a large consolidated high school. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with personality being a key factor in attracting and inspiring students. By sharing these experiences, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession, and the importance of finding the right fit and approach in the educational field."

To be successful, a teacher needs a strong general education and should specialize in their chosen field, while also continuing to broaden their knowledge. When applying for a job, teachers should be careful and thorough in filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A teacher's motivation for applying for a position should be based on a desire to grow professionally, rather than just seeking a higher salary. By being prepared, professional, and motivated, a teacher can increase their chances of success in their career."
