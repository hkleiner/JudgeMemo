        "section_summary": "Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and efforts were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan, led by Field Marshal Moltke, was close to succeeding due to Russia's initial unpreparedness. The Russian Army's bravery and heroism, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, helped to save the situation at critical moments, including the battles of Galicia, Warsaw, and East Prussia. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was instrumental in the Allied victory, and its contributions should not be underestimated."

        "section_summary": "The German military plan, led by Moltke, aimed to concentrate all forces against France, but this plan was foiled when Russia unexpectedly rushed into East Prussia, diverting German troops from the French front. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and lost them their only chance at a decisive victory. Despite being unprepared, Russia's early involvement in the war played a crucial role in the Allied cause, bearing the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's historic role in the war is being obscured by later events and distorted by biased accounts, such as General Ludendorff's memoirs, which attempt to slander the Russian Army. Russia's sacrifices and contributions to the war effort are often overlooked, despite being a key factor in the ultimate defeat of Germany."
