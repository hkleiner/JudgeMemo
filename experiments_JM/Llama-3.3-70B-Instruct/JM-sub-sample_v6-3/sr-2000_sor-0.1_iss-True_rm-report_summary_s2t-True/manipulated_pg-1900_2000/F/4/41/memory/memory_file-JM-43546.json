The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his parents, and they decide to try to find the owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he is overjoyed at the prospect of having a new pet. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, discussing the puppy and making plans to visit Donald's uncle, who has invited them to a birthday party for his daughter Marjorie."
