        "section_summary": "The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, and have a language that resembles Khirgis and Turkish. The village has a small, poorly used temple, and the lamas earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, with minimal contributions from the villagers. The local administration is overseen by a pykh and his assistant, who collect a yearly tax of thirteen horses from the villages of Machuangtzu, Tungheitzu, and Yumashan for the Chinese government."

        "section_summary": "The houses visited were generally clean and built in Chinese style, with traditional features such as a sleeping stove and Buddhist altar. The people's clothing and household items were also largely Chinese in origin, with some Mongolian influences. The women's head dresses were particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, copper rings, and metal ornaments. The Sarö Yögur people had limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items as they only sold old, worn-out items. The women were skilled weavers, producing cloth of good quality, which was one of the few saleable items they possessed."
