Yen Kuei Ping, a young Chinese girl, visits this street with her grandmother, mother, and a relative to purchase her dowry jewels. At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered tea, and then begin the process of selecting and bargaining for the finest pearls. Kuei Ping is drawn to the pearls and, with her grandmother's guidance, they carefully select the most beautiful ones. The scene is a significant moment in Kuei Ping's life, one that she will remember fondly in the years to come, and it marks a transition to her memories of her time at a little mission school."
