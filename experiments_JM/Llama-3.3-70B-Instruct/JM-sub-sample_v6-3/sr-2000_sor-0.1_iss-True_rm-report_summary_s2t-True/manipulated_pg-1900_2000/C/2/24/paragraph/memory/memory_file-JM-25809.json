He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. He reads a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, and he is deeply hurt and enraged. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and is also struggling financially. Jim's situation is further complicated by his sense of responsibility and his desire to prove himself to Anne."

Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him to ride. Bud agrees and tells Jim about his recent encounter with a humpbacked man who tried to rob him, but only got $10. After returning with the burro, Bud teases Jim about his new \"thoroughbred\" and the two friends prepare to part ways at the fork in the trail. Jim tries to thank Bud, but he brushes off the gratitude."
