Section section_01 (Chars 0–8426):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a unique language and culture, with some similarities to Turkish and Khirgis, but they have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history or legends. The team stayed in the village temple, which was small and poorly used, and learned about the local administration and way of life, including the lamas' roles in education and cattle-keeping. The villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, which is collected by an officer stationed in a nearby town.

Section section_02 (Chars 8427–12850):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and heated sleeping stoves. Their household utensils and clothing are mostly of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences, and are often made from home-spun materials. The women's traditional head dress is particularly distinctive, featuring copper rings, coral, and glass beads, and is worn from marriage until death. The Yögur people have limited handicrafts, with women weaving cloth and men making baskets and knitting stockings using primitive techniques. Their woven cloth is one of their few saleable items, which they sell in nearby markets, highlighting their simple and self-sufficient way of life.
