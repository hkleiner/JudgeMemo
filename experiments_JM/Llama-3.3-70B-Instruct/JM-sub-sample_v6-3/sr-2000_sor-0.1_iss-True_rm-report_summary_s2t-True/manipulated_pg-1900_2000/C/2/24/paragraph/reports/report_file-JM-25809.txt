Section section_01 (Chars 0–7851):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is sitting on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated despite the beautiful surroundings. He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. He reads a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, and he is deeply hurt and enraged. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and is also struggling financially. Jim's situation is further complicated by his sense of responsibility and his desire to prove himself to Anne.
