They take a tram to Battersea and, upon arrival, try to find the dog home without asking for directions, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful. A street boy they ask for help gives them a misleading and cheeky response, and they then spot an official from the dog home and decide to follow him discreetly. However, tracking the official through the streets of London proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. The couple's attempts to follow the official lead to various awkward encounters, including pauses in front of shop windows and a brief consideration of entering a public house."
