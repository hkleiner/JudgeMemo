Section Summary: Jean François Millet is considered one of the greatest painters of peasant life, alongside artists like Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, capturing the everyday life of simple peasants with a profound and sympathetic rendering. His paintings, such as those depicting the angelus, convey the struggles and hardships of rural life, as well as the importance of religion in providing comfort and solace. Millet's unique style, developed through his simple and earnest life, is marked by subtleties of line and tone that reflect the atmospheric effects of the French countryside. His work is a testament to the enduring power of art to convey meaningful messages and emotions, and its appreciation requires a deep understanding of the country and landscape he depicted.
