The author, determined to visit the front, attempts to obtain permission through various influential people, including a duchess who helps her meet with a high-ranking official. After explaining her mission to publicize the work of \"Le Bienêtre du Blessé\", an organization that provides aid to convalescent soldiers, she is granted a \"carnet rouge\" allowing her to visit certain base hospitals. However, her request to visit Amiens, which is close to the front lines, is denied due to the ongoing battle of the Somme. The author is instead offered permission to visit other locations, including Châlons-sur-Marne and Bar-le-Duc, which are also near the war zone."

        "section_summary": "The Mayor of a village described the intense shelling his village endured, with shells shrieking overhead for six days. The author then reflects on the idea that every idea or institution can provoke a violent reaction, citing historical examples such as Roman imperialism and the Catholic Church. The author, eager to experience the war firsthand, embarked on a trip to Bar-le-Duc and Châlons, despite having grown comfortable in Paris. Along the way, they observed crowded train stations filled with healthy and contented soldiers, and noted the physical stature of the French officers, who were predominantly tall. The author's journey was motivated by a desire to see and hear something beyond the comforts of Paris, after three months of relative calm."
