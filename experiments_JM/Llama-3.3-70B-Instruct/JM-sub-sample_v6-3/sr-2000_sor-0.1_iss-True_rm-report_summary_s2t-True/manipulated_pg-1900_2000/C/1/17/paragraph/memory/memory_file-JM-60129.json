        "section_summary": "The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a sandy and sterile stretch of ground, eventually reaching the village of Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people, also known as the \"yellow Yögurs\". The villagers, who claim to have originated from a city in the west over a thousand years ago, speak a language similar to Khirgis and Turkish. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas and learned about the local administration, which is overseen by a pykh and his assistant yarkatshe. The villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their culture and language are distinct from other nearby villages."

        "section_summary": "The Sarö Yögur people's homes feature traditional Chinese elements, such as the k'ang sleeping stove and Buddhist altars, with some Mongolian influences. Their clothing is also a mix of Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men wearing long coats and fur hats, and women wearing distinctive head dresses adorned with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The people engage in basic handicrafts like weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with women weaving cloth on primitive looms and men making baskets and knitting stockings. The Sarö Yögur have limited clothing and do not have holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items during the cold season. Overall, their daily life and traditions reflect a blend of Chinese and Mongolian cultures."
