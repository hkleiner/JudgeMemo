        "section_summary": "The story begins by describing the aristocracy of 1785, who were highly cultivated and enlightened patrons of literature and art. The narrative then shifts to the present, where the protagonist and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, as they want to buy a dog that can bark at beggars and be gentle with their baby. They decide to follow a man who is an official of the Home for Lost and Starving Dogs, rather than asking him for directions, in order to avoid conversation and tipping him. As they track him through the streets, they find it to be a challenging and humiliating task, trying to keep a distance without being noticed. The couple's journey is marked by comedic moments, including their attempts to avoid collisions with the man and their awkward loitering on the pavement."

However, they ended up chasing him through the streets, only to have him escape into a villa, leaving them guideless and dogless. After their failed adventure, they decided to head home, exhausted and discomfited. Stella was frustrated and didn't want to see a dog again, but the narrator suggested advertising for a dog as their next plan. The couple's evening ended with Stella being shaken and the narrator trying to comfort her as they walked home."
