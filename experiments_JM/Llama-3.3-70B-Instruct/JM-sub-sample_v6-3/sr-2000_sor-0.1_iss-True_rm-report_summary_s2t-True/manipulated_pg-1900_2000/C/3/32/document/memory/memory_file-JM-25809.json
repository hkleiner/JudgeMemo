He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation, which has left him feeling hurt and enraged. Jim is torn between his desire to be with Anne and his passion for prospecting, but he is currently struggling to make ends meet. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too broke. Despite his struggles, Jim holds onto the hope of finding gold and being with Anne, and he is reluctant to give up on his dreams."

Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him to ride. Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man while delivering mail, and how he chased the man and eventually gave him $10. Bud then retrieves a burro for Jim and they prepare to part ways, with Jim tying a gunny sack on the burro to ride. As they say their goodbyes, Bud knocks Jim's hat over his eyes, indicating their friendly and playful relationship."
