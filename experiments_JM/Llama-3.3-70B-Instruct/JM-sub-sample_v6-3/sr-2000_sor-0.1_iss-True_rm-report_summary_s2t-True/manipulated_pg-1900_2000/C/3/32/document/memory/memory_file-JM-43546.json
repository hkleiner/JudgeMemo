        "section_summary": "The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his father, Doctor Gordon, who suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he hopes to train it to be a sheep-dog. The family enjoys a warm and lively afternoon tea together, discussing their plans and excitement about an upcoming visit to Uncle Alan's home, where they will celebrate a birthday party."

The boys began planning all the fun activities they would do together, with Don sharing stories of his uncle's estate, Skylemore, in the Highlands.
