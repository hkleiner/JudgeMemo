        "section_summary": "Jean Fran√ßois Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is characterized by its profound and sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of simple peasants. He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Elder, who is now recognized as one of the greatest masters of peasant painting. Millet's paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are infused with a deep understanding of the struggles and troubles of the peasant class. His unique style, which is marked by subtlety and restraint, is deeply rooted in his own experiences of living a life of struggle and his study of the Italian Renaissance masters. Overall, Millet's work is a powerful and enduring portrayal of peasant life, and his paintings continue to be appreciated for their intense earnestness and melancholy truth."

        "section_summary": "Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in \"La Baigneuse,\" his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and simplicity of rural life, often focusing on the loneliness and hardships of the peasant's labor. His work reveals a philosophical mind that grappled with the problems of life, and his interest in the everyday lives of peasants is evident in his paintings, drawings, and etchings. Overall, Millet's art is marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep understanding of the human experience."
