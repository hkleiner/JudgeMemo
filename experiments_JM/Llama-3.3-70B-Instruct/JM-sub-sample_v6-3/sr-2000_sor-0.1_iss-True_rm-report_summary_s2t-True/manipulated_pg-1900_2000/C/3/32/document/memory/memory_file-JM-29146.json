Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government has taken this step to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships, and will only allow Irwadian pilots to transport it. Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene, and he has a few hundred credits to tide him over. The move is expected to give Irwadi control over the titanium trade and allow them to set their own prices."

This means that only Irwadian pilots will be allowed to transport titanium, a vital metal, through hyper-space, giving Irwadi control over the market. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is among those affected and has surrendered his pilot license, but he's not too concerned as he has some savings to tide him over. An Earthgirl, who has the ability to read minds, has also left the ship and is heading to the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, trying not to panic. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially and worried about supporting his family, and they discuss their uncertain futures on the planet."

A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, wearing flashy jewelry, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent."
