1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Complex sentence structures may hinder readability
* [LEXICON] Some archaic vocabulary (e.g., "Nabobs", "parasitism") might be unfamiliar to modern readers
* [SYNTAX] Long paragraphs and sentences could improve with more breaks for easier flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing social classes to warning about civilization's potential downfall
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas (social fusion, effects of industry, historical comparisons) without clear connections
