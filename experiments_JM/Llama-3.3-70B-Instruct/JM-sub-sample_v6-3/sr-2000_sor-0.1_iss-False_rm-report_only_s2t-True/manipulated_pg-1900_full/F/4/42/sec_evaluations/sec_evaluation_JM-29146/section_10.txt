Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "Because he thought he would died" should be "Because he thought he would die"
* [GRAMMAR] "although the purely mental lives continuously" is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding
* [GRAMMAR] "Vardin say" should be "Vardin said"
* [GRAMMAR] "Ramar Chind and Chind" seems to be a typo or incorrect naming
* [GRAMMAR] "Garr Symm from ran" should be "Garr Symm ran"
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between Ramsey's conversation with Vardin and the conclusion of the story feels abrupt
* [CLARITY] The concept of "proto-man" and the equation of doom could be explained more clearly for better understanding
* [STRUCTURE] The story jumps quickly from action to philosophical discussion and then to a conclusion, which might feel disjointed to some readers
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
