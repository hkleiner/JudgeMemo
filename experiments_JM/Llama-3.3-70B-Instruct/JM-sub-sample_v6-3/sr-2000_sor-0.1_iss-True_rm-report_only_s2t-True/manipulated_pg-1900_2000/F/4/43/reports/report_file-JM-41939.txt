Section section_02 (Chars 8525–12746):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, also known as "the little hussard," spent her early years studying art at the Louvre and in her father's studio, where she developed a strong foundation in line-work and anatomy. She lived in various locations in Paris, including the Rue Rumford, where she was surrounded by farms and animals, which sparked her passion for painting animals. Rosa's dedication to her craft led her to study animal anatomy, sculpture, and dissection, and she even kept a menagerie in her home to observe and draw her subjects. In 1841, at the age of 19, she submitted her first paintings to the Salon, which were accepted, and she continued to exhibit her work annually, eventually gaining recognition from critics for her sincere and vigorous talent. Through her hard work and perseverance, Rosa established herself as a skilled painter of animals, known for her attention to detail and ability to capture their physiognomies and actions with fidelity and art.
