He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation. Jim is hurt and enraged by the letter, but also understands Anne's concerns and knows she is not being mercenary. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too broke and also influenced by the idea that Anne is always watching over him. Jim's situation is further complicated by his sense of responsibility to repay Bud, who has lent him money in the past."

Bud offers Jim his horse to ride to the nearest railroad station, 50 miles away in Plattsburg, but Jim declines. Instead, Jim asks Bud to round up a burro for him, which Bud does. Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal valuable mail, but only got $10. Jim and Bud then set off together, with Jim riding the burro, and part ways at the fork in the trail."
