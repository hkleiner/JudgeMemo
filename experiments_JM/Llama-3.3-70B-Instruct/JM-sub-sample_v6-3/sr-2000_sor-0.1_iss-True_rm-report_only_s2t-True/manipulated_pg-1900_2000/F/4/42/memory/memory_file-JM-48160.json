To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux, a location that was not close enough to the front lines. The author persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although some locations, like Verdun, were deemed too dangerous. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where they witnessed the devastating effects of war, including mass graves and cemeteries."

The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, listening to constant shellfire overhead. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Ch√¢lons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter of introduction to facilitate their trip. They traveled to these destinations alone, observing many healthy and contented soldiers at the train station and on the trains. The narrator was impressed by the height and demeanor of the French officers they met on the train, who seemed confident and capable of leading the country's military efforts."
