He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation. Jim is hurt and enraged by the letter, but also understands Anne's concerns and knows she is not being mercenary. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and also because he is broke. Jim's situation is further complicated by his sense of responsibility to repay Bud, who has lent him money in the past."

Instead, Jim asks Bud to round up a burro for him, which Bud does. Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man while delivering mail, but he chased the man and only gave him $10. After returning with the burro, Bud and Jim set off together, with Jim riding the burro and Bud walking alongside. As they part ways at a fork in the trail, Jim tries to thank Bud, who playfully knocks his hat over his eyes."
