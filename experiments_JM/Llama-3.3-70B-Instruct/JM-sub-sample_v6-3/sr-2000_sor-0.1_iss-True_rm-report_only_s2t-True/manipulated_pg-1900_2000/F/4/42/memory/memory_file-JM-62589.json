Debby is defiant and refuses to obey Mrs. Lane's orders, including a ban on speaking to her friend Jack Martin. As a result, Debby is physically punished and sent to her room, where she is forced to reflect on her behavior and think about her mother, who is not present in her life. Debby's thoughts turn to her father, who is away, and she wonders if he might be involved in the battles against the King's men, fueling her own hatred for the King. As the evening draws to a close, Debby awaits Mrs. Lane's return, expecting further punishment and conflict."
