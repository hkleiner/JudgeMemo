        "section_summary": "The author participated in a historic movement, sending 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands on July 23, 1901. This event marked a milestone in civilization and an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they visited notable sites such as the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. Along the way, they crossed the International Date Line, resulting in the loss of a day, and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs. The author describes the rough waters of Manila Bay and the unique attire and habits of the native people they encountered upon arrival."
