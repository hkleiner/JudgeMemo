Section section_01 (Chars 0–8250):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief, including a street boy's suggestion to "bite a policeman." They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they continue to follow the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including being approached by a butcher trying to sell them a bullock's heart.

Section section_02 (Chars 8251–12618):
Section Summary: Stella and the narrator were trying to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home to collect a dog they were interested in adopting. However, they ended up chasing him through the streets, only to discover that he was actually returning to his home. The man and his wife deliberately shut them out, and Stella and the narrator were left exhausted and disappointed. After their failed adventure, they returned home by train and decided to walk across the golf course, with Stella still feeling unstrung from their earlier experience. The narrator suggests advertising for a dog, but Stella is hesitant, still shaken by their earlier encounter.
