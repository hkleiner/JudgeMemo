They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. After arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with difficulty, including a misleading suggestion from a street boy to \"bite a policeman.\" They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including encounters with shopkeepers and pedestrians."

However, they ended up chasing him through the streets, only to discover that he was actually going home to his wife. The man and his wife deliberately shut them out, and the narrator and Stella were left exhausted and discomfited. After their failed adventure, they returned home, deciding to walk across the golf course, and Stella was clearly shaken by the experience. The narrator suggests advertising for a dog, but Stella is hesitant, still reeling from their earlier ordeal."
