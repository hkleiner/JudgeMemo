Section section_01 (Chars 0–7854):
Section Summary: The narrator, a young writer, is given the opportunity to review Hugh Vereker's new novel for _The Middle_ by his friend George Corvick, who is unable to do it himself due to a personal emergency. The narrator is eager to meet Vereker, who will be attending a gathering at Bridges, and wants to make a good impression by having read and reviewed his work. After writing the review, the narrator meets Vereker at Bridges, but is unsure if he has read the review, and is tempted to bring it up in conversation. However, he is discouraged from doing so by the presence of others, and instead, Lady Jane ends up drawing attention to the review, praising its "sweet little truths" about Vereker's work. The narrator is relieved that Lady Jane has helped to bring his review to Vereker's attention, and is hopeful that it will make a good impression.

Section section_02 (Chars 7854–11223):
Section Summary: Lady Jane is excited to show a review of Hugh Vereker's work to him, and she has marked the most flattering passages. Vereker takes the review from her and later reads it in his room. The narrator, who wrote the review, reveals his authorship to Lady Jane, but she seems less impressed than he expected. At dinner, Vereker is asked about the review by another guest, Miss Poyle, and he dismisses it as "the usual twaddle," which surprises the narrator. Vereker's response suggests that he believes the review failed to truly understand his work, and he playfully implies that the author is blind to his deeper meaning.
