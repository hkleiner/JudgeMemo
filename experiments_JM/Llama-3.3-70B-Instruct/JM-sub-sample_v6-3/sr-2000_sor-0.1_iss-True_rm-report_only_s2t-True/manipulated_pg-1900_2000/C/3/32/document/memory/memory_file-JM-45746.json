        "section_summary": "The author recounts how they became a teacher by chance, without a clear aspiration or preparation, and how this was a common experience among their peers. The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who treated it as a mere job and another who approached it as a profession, taking initiative and showing enthusiasm for improving education. The second young man's dedication and attention to detail led to his success, eventually becoming the head of a large consolidated high school. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with personality being a key factor in inspiring and attracting students. By sharing these experiences, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession, and the impact it can have on one's career and students."

        "section_summary": "A teacher should make a good impression, including dressing professionally, as it reflects their \"dress sense\" and ability to instruct students. To be successful, a teacher must have a good general education and specialize in their chosen field, while also continually broadening their knowledge. When applying for positions, teachers should be careful in filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A teacher's motivation for applying for a position should be understood by their current superintendent, who can then provide support and assistance. Ultimately, a teacher's goal should be professional growth and improvement, rather than just seeking a higher-paying job."
