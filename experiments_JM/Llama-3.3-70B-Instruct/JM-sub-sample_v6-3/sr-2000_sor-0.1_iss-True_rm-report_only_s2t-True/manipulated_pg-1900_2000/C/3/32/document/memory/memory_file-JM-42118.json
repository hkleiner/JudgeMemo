        "section_summary": "Jean Honor√© Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a beautiful and sunlit environment, Fragonard was inspired by the natural beauty of Provence, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he was aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful patron of the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a career in painting. He was eventually allowed to follow his artistic bent, setting him on a path to become a renowned artist."

        "section_summary": "In 1750, the year of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher. Boucher, impressed by the boy's potential, advised him to train with Chardin to learn the basics of painting, but Fragonard made little progress and was sent away. After six months of studying on his own, Fragonard returned to Boucher and was taken on as a student, working on large decorative cartoons and learning valuable skills. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's talent flourished, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting \"Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols.\" Fragonard continued to work with Boucher and later became a student at the king's school, producing notable works such as \"Blind Man's Buff.\""
