Section section_02 (Chars 8588–12819):
Section Summary: The section begins by mentioning the Universal House of Justice and the confidence of Bahá'ís in the future of the planet, but then shifts to a historical account of the Christianization of England. In 597, Augustine landed in England and began to preach and instruct the locals, with the support of King Ethelbert, who eventually converted to Christianity. The city of Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The church of St. Martin's, where Augustine and his monks began to preach, is considered one of the oldest Christian churches in England, with some historians believing it may date back to the Roman period. Despite some uncertainty about its exact origins, St. Martin's remains a significant historical site and an important part of England's Christian heritage.
