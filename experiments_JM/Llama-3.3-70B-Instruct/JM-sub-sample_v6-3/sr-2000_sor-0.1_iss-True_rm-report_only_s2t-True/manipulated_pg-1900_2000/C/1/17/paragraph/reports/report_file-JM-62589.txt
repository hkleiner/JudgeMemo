Section section_02 (Chars 7860–13897):
Section Summary: The passage begins with a quote from Tocqueville about the potential dangers of democracy, but quickly shifts to the story of Debby, a young girl who has had a difficult life with her father. Debby's mother had encouraged her to be a lady and stay with her father, but after her mother's passing, Debby's life became one of neglect and misery. Debby is now living with Mrs. Lane, who tries to discipline and moralize her, but Debby resists and is drawn to a friend named Jack Martin, whom Mrs. Lane disapproves of. As Debby sits in her room, reflecting on her life and her desire to be decent and respectable, she thinks about her father and wonders if he may have been involved in the battles against King George. Debby's thoughts are interrupted by the sound of Mrs. Lane's evening devotions, and she knows that she will soon face punishment for her disobedience.
