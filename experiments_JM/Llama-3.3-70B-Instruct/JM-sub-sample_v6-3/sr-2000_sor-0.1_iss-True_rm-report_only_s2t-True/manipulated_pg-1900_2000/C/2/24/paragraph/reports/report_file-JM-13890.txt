Section section_01 (Chars 0–8655):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who had been dead for 368 years, to appear and answer charges of treason. As a result, Becket's shrine was destroyed, and his name and memory were erased from records and landmarks. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. The city was later abandoned and rebuilt by the Anglo-Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent, and it eventually became a significant place in English history.

Section section_02 (Chars 8656–12872):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. Prior to 597, the Saxon capital was largely heathen, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard. In 597, Augustine arrived and was allowed to preach and instruct in Canterbury, leading to the conversion of Ethelbert and many Saxons to Christianity. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city's St. Martin's church, where Queen Bertha worshipped, is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, with its origins possibly dating back to the Roman or Saxon period.
