        "section_summary": "The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his father, Doctor Gordon, who suggests that they try to find the puppy's owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he hopes to train it to be a sheep-dog. The story concludes with an invitation from Doctor Gordon's brother, Uncle Alan, to visit him next month, which excites Donald and his friend Sandy."

        "section_summary": "When Mrs. Gordon announced that their cousins, Janet and Marjorie, would be visiting, Don and Sandy were overjoyed. The boys started planning all the fun activities they could do together, with Don sharing stories of his uncle's estate, Skylemore, in the Highlands. Uncle Alan, who had made a fortune in America, had returned to Scotland and bought a beautiful estate with a big park, woodland, and a loch, where Don had many exciting adventures. Don loved hearing his uncle's stories about his life in America, including his encounters with Indians and experiences in big cities. The news of the visit was a welcome addition to the household, where a newly adopted puppy, named Rob Roy after the hero of Sir Walter Scott's story, had already brought joy to the family."
