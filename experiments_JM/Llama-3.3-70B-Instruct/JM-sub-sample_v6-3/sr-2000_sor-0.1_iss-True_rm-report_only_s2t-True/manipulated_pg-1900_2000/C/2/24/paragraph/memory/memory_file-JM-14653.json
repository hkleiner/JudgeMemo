        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a chore, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder and enthusiasm of Christmas, but adults have lost some of that faith and excitement. The author argues that this decline in Christmas spirit is a fact that should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied."

        "section_summary": "The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century idealists, such as philosophers and scientists, who prioritized truth and skepticism over faith and tradition. Their discoveries and ideas led to an age of doubt, causing people to question and eventually dismiss long-held beliefs, including the traditional depiction of Christmas. As a result, faith and sentimentality have become undervalued, and people are left feeling lost and uncertain. However, despite this, people still instinctively cling to the Christmas spirit, suggesting that it remains essential to their well-being. Ultimately, the core principles of Christmas, such as goodwill and charity, remain intact and continue to be vital to human dignity and existence."
