        "section_summary": "Jean Honor√© Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a picturesque and romantic setting, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the kingdom and a patron of the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a different path, with his master eventually advising that he be allowed to follow his artistic bent. Fragonard's early life and surroundings laid the foundation for his future as a renowned artist."

        "section_summary": "In 1748, a 16-year-old Fragonard and his mother traveled to Paris to meet the renowned painter Boucher, who advised them that Fragonard needed more training and recommended he study under Chardin. However, Fragonard made little progress with Chardin and was eventually sent away. After six months of self-study, Fragonard returned to Boucher and was accepted into his studio, where he worked on decorative cartoons and learned valuable skills. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's talents flourished, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting \"Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols.\" Fragonard then continued his studies at the king's school and worked in Boucher's studio, producing notable works such as \"Blind Man's Buff.\""
