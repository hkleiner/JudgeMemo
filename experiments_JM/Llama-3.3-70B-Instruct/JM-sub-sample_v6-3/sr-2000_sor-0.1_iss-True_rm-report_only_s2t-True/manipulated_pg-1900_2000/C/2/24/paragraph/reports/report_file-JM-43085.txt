Meissonier's early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, with his father initially discouraging him due to the tumultuous state of the art world at the time. Despite this, Meissonier's talent and dedication eventually prevailed, and he went on to become a successful artist.

Section section_02 (Chars 8482–13014):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. During his time at Cogniet's studio, Meissonier was inspired by the Napoleonic Epic and developed his artistic skills by drawing soldiers and horses. Despite struggling financially, Meissonier shared his poverty with friends, including Daumier and Daubigny, and found ways to make a living, including decorating fans and creating illustrations for publishers. At the age of 16, Meissonier exhibited his work for the first time, but it was not well-received by the public. He eventually gained recognition from editors and publishers, including Curmer, after persisting and showcasing his talent through his illustrations.
