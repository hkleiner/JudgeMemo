They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful, and they are even mocked by a street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and embarrassing."

However, they ended up chasing him through the streets, only to discover that he was actually returning to his home. The man and his wife deliberately shut them out, and Stella and the narrator were left exhausted and disappointed. After their failed adventure, they returned home, deciding to walk across the golf course, and Stella was still upset about the experience. The narrator suggests advertising for a dog, but Stella is hesitant, still shaken by their earlier ordeal."
