Section section_01 (Chars 0–8144):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point with two anecdotes: one about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase but doesn't truly appreciate the books, and another about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognizes the value of classic literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both light and serious reading, and that the key to being a bookman is the ability to distinguish between books that are truly meaningful and those that are fleeting. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, unassuming bookman who reads and appreciates literature for its own sake, rather than for social status or prestige.

Section section_02 (Chars 8144–11574):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and truly great. A true classic is one that has enriched the human mind, spoken to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcended the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire and educate generations. The author believes that a book's subject matter is secondary to its literary quality, and a true book lover can appreciate great works from various perspectives and genres. Ultimately, the author values books that have a lasting impact and are worthy of repeated reading and study.
