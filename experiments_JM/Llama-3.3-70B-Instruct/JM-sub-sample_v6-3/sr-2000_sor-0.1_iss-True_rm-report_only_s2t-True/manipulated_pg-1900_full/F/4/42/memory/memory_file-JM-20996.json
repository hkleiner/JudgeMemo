This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's beauty and unique culture, including the Pali precipice and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. After crossing the International Date Line, they lost a day and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs, including the traditional clothing and habits of the native people. The author describes their arrival in Manila during the rainy season, where they were struck by the rough waters of the bay and the unique appearance of the local inhabitants."

The teachers were concerned about being sent to remote areas with limited access to necessities, but after a meeting with the chief executive, they were reassured that their needs would be met. The author and others then set off for their assigned destinations, with the author heading to Bacalod, the capital of Occidental Negros. Upon arrival, they found a small, seemingly insignificant town, but as they explored, they encountered a group of troops preparing to embark for home, marking the end of the reign of force and the beginning of the reign of peace. The author was struck by the hospitality of the native people, particularly a woman who attended to a soldier's needs with kindness and attention."

The American teachers, who had arrived in the Philippines, began their work in towns like Bacalod and Talisay, where they faced challenges in establishing schools and teaching the English language. Despite the difficulties, they made progress, and by the end of a year, two schools were functioning well, with some students making excellent progress. The teachers also participated in social events, such as a \"baile\" in Silay, where they interacted with the local elite, although language barriers limited their communication."

In contrast to the luxury of city life, the narrator notes that living in the Philippines can be expensive, especially in Manila, where it is difficult to live well on a small income. The country's complex commerce and limited transportation options also make it challenging to maintain a comfortable lifestyle outside of the city."

In these rural areas, life is slow-paced and centered around family and community, with little exposure to the outside world. The homes of Filipinos also reflect their social class, with the rich having large, well-furnished houses and the poor, known as \"tao\", living in simple dwellings with limited amenities. The contrast between the rich and the poor is significant, with the middle class filling the gap between the two extremes."
