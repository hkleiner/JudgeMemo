To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber scenery."

        "section_summary": "The author visited the Hôpital Central in Bar-le-Duc, where they were shown around by the infirmière major, Mlle. de Sézilles, and the médicin chef. The hospital was well-organized and clean, with efforts made to relieve the barrenness of the wards, including decorations and flowering shrubs. The author was struck by the gratitude and cheerfulness of the wounded French soldiers, who appreciated the small comforts and kindnesses shown to them. The wealthy in France, however, are no longer able to support the war effort as they once did, due to financial struggles and depleted incomes. The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the war effort, highlighting the importance of practical sympathy and generosity."
