Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the light engine into which it have charge" should be "the light engine into which it had charge"
- [GRAMMAR] "the reeling engine of the express left the rails and staggered drunkenly along the ballast" is a long sentence and could be broken up for better clarity
- [LEXICON] "bouleversement" is an uncommon word that may cause confusion for some readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter jumps abruptly from the train accident to the curate's conversation with Lord Caversham
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the train accident scene and the scene with Mary Ellen and Excalibur could be smoother
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
