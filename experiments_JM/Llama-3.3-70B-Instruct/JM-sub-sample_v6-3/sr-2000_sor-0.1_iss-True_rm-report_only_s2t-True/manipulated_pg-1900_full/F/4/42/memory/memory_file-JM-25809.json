Despite his feelings, Jim is interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who tries to cheer him up and suggests that he take a break and go to town to have some fun. However, Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and also because he is \"busted\" and doesn't want to incur more debt with Bud. Jim's frustration and disappointment with his situation are palpable, and he is struggling to come to terms with Anne's rejection and his own financial struggles."

He decides to send a young boy, Ches, to get help from a group of miners who are eight miles away. Ches rides a horse, Buck, to the miners' location and tells them about the emergency, and they quickly spring into action to help. The miners, led by Captain Hanrahan, rush to the scene with their tools and equipment, and the captain takes charge of the rescue effort. The captain's experienced leadership and careful planning ensure a safe and efficient rescue operation to free Jim from the tunnel."
