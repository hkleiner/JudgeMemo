        "section_summary": "In 1820, the remains of a great ancient Egyptian city were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to Egyptian society, including a shift away from war and towards religion and culture. The tablets also revealed the complexities of communication and diplomacy in the ancient East, with scribes using various languages and scripts to convey their messages."

As a result, the king moved the capital to Tell el Amarna and introduced changes to the official names and titles of his courtiers. The new doctrine, which was based on natural phenomena, was seen as heretical and was not widely accepted, especially among the Asiatic vassals who continued to refer to Amon in their communications. The king's officials, such as Yanhamu, the governor of Lower Egypt, played important roles in maintaining control over the Asiatic provinces, but the region was plagued by conflicts and power struggles among the native princes and chiefs. The situation was further complicated by the immigration of Bedawìn tribes, including the Sutu and Habiri, who encroached upon Egyptian territory and formed alliances with some of the vassal chiefs, leading to increased strife and instability."

        "section_summary": "In Palestine, the Habiri's seizure of strongholds and the Bedawîn's unrest created an opportunity for ambitious vassals to establish independent kingdoms, taking advantage of Egypt's distance and the Pharaoh's limited response. The Egyptian government, despite being well-informed, took a middle course by sending small, inadequate forces to quell the disturbances, which sometimes restored peace but ultimately failed to check serious hostilities. The letters from Asiatic kings, including Kadashman-Bel of Babylon, reveal a complex web of diplomatic relations, with the Egyptian king being asked for gold and hesitant to give away his daughters in marriage due to their perceived divine status. These letters also show that the Egyptian king's claim to divine honors caused difficulties in diplomatic intercourse, with other kings like Kadashman-Bel appreciating and mocking this weakness. The correspondence between Egyptian pharaohs and other kings, such as Tushratta of Mitani, provides valuable insights into the politics and alliances of the time, with Mitani seeking a steady alliance with Egypt to secure its existence amidst threats from Babylonia and the Hittites."

After Nimmuria's death, Tushratta's relationship with the new king, Akhenaten (also known as Napkhuria), deteriorated, and Akhenaten's reckless and impolitic behavior strained Egypt's relationships with other kingdoms, including Babylonia. Akhenaten's actions, such as sending gold to the Assyrian prince and receiving an Assyrian embassy, were seen as a breach of etiquette and a challenge to Babylonian authority. This led to a deterioration in Egypt's foreign relations, with Burnaburiash, the king of Babylonia, threatening retaliation and the Sutu of the desert planning to attack Egyptian messengers."

Tushratta sent multiple letters, including one to Napkhuria's mother, Queen Teye, asking for her intercession in the matter. The dispute between Tushratta and Napkhuria ultimately led to a cessation of intercourse between their kingdoms.

The city of Tunip and Rib-Addi of Gebal sent complaints to Pharaoh about Aziru's aggressive actions, but their pleas for help were often ignored or delayed. Despite his questionable loyalty and alliances with Egyptian foes, Aziru managed to evade punishment for many years, but was eventually summoned to court and arrested. The archives suggest that while Aziru's actions were problematic, they also brought a measure of stability to the region, ending a period of lawlessness and petty raids by other chiefs."

The kingdom of Mitani, which had once been a powerful state, was on the verge of collapse, threatened by the rising Hittite empire and Babylonians. Mitani's king, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, but the kingdom eventually vanished and was replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms. The XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt also met a swift end, with Napkhuria's city at Tell el Amarna being razed to the ground after his death in 1370 B.C."
