Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "mighted" should be "might"
- [GRAMMAR] "have been" should be "had been" in some instances for consistency
- [LEXICON] Some sentences are wordy or use less common vocabulary, potentially disrupting the flow
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences have complex structures that may hinder readability
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from the father's visit to Fuh Tang's illness without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The text switches between different time periods and storylines, which can be confusing
- [CLARITY] Some sections, like the description of Fuh Tang's illness and its consequences, feel somewhat disconnected from the rest of the narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
