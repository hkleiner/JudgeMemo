They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief, including a street boy's suggestion to \"bite a policeman.\" They then spot an official from the Home for Lost Dogs and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including encounters with shopkeepers and a public house."

Exhausted and discomfited, they returned home, and Stella suggested that they should have considered the possibility that the man was coming from the Dogs' Home, not going to it. The next day, while walking home across the golf course, they found a small, wet puppy tied to a brick and rescued it. The family spent three days deciding on a name for the puppy, eventually settling on Excalibur, or Scally for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a loyal and humble-minded companion, often accompanying the family on walks and developing into a unique-looking dog with a \"rather badly stuffed lion\" appearance."

He is also prone to getting into trouble, such as when he is given a shoulder of mutton and then forgets where he buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often cause embarrassment, as when he hides a bone in a cushion at a dinner party, but his affectionate nature makes him a beloved member of the family."

One day, while on a walk, Excalibur jumped through a window into the room of a young curate, Mr. Gilmore, and made a mess, but Eileen's charm and apology helped to break the ice and introduce her to the curate. As Eileen and the curate spent more time together, Excalibur became a frequent chaperone, and his presence was tolerated despite the chaos he often caused, such as disrupting tennis games on the lawn. Excalibur's laid-back nature made him a patient and forgiving companion, even as his routine was disrupted by the new activities and visitors."

The curate felt that he couldn't provide for Eileen on his own and decided that he needed to leave for London to find work and build a better future for them. Despite their concerns, the pair put on a brave face and decided not to share their plans with others.
