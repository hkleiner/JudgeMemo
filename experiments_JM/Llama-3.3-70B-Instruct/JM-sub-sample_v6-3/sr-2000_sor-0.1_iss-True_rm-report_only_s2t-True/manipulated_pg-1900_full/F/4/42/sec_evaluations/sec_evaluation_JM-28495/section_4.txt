Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The parcel in question contain" should be "The parcel in question contains"
- [GRAMMAR] "I think my brother-in-law called on you a few days ago," should be followed by a more grammatically consistent sentence, as "I thought you must had been" is incorrect, it should be "I thought you must have been"
- [LEXICON] Some sentences are wordy or use less common vocabulary, which may hinder smooth reading
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from describing Excalibur's daily walks to introducing a new character and scene without a clear connection
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the narrative
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the description of Excalibur's antics and the introduction of the curate could be smoother
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
