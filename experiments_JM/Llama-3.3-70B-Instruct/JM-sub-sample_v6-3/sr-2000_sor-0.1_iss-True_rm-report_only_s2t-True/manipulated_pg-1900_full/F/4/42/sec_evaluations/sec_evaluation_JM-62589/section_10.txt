Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "as he go about his duties" should be "as he goes about his duties"
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded face death" is not a valid phrase, possibly "could face death"
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from Debby's confession to Doctor Bell's decision to help her could be smoother
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter jumps abruptly from Debby's meeting with Washington to her new life at Doctor Bell's mother's home
