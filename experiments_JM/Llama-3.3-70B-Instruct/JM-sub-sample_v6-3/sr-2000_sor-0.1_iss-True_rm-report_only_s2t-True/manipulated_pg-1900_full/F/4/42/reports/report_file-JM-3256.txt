Section section_01 (Chars 0–8134):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point through anecdotes, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare or Milton demonstrates a natural affinity for literature, despite his lack of formal education. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting, popular books and timeless, classic literature.

Section section_03 (Chars 16248–24435):
Section Summary: The author reminisces about their childhood love for Red Indian stories and trapper tales, which sparked their imagination and fascination with adventure. As they grew older, they discovered more mature authors like Mayne Reid, Dumas, and the classics - Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens, whose works remain a staple in their library. The author holds a special place for Thackeray's "Henry Esmond" and Scott's "Heart of Midlothian", two books that they revisit annually, and struggles to choose between the two due to their unique charms. These classic novels offer a sense of comfort and pleasure, allowing the author to escape the intensity of modern literature. The author ultimately concludes that both Thackeray and Scott are masters of their craft, each with their own strengths and memorable characters.

Section section_05 (Chars 32650–40845):
Section Summary: The author describes the allure of books and how they can captivate people, even across centuries. The love of books can be hereditary, with a father's passion for reading and collecting books often passed down to his son. A book collector, or "bookman," can become so enamored with books that it becomes an obsession, similar to a disease, and can lead to financial and personal sacrifices. The author humorously compares this obsession to dipsomania, or alcoholism, with the bookman's wife often suffering as a result of his habits. Ultimately, the bookman's desire for books can lead him to make sacrifices and even practice deceit in order to obtain the books he desires.
