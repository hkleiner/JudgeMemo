Section Summary: During the height of Venice's glory, Paolo Veronese arrived at the perfect moment to satisfy the city's demand for art, surpassing his rivals and becoming one of the foremost painters of the time.

Section section_04 (Chars 25374–33776):
Section Summary: Veronese's painting, "The Wedding at Cana", is a masterpiece that showcases his unique method, which disregards historical accuracy and traditional religious depictions. The painting features a mix of biblical figures and contemporary personalities, including the artist himself, and was widely admired by his peers. However, Veronese's unconventional approach to religious art led to him being summoned by the Inquisition, which criticized his "Feast at the House of Levi" for its perceived irreverence. Veronese defended his work, citing the precedent set by other great masters, and was ultimately allowed to continue painting, although he was forced to make some changes to the offending work. Despite this setback, Veronese's reputation continued to grow, and he eventually made a long-awaited trip to Rome, although details of his time there are scarce.
