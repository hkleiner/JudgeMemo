        "section_summary": "The series of lectures on Hebraic thought and learning was founded in memory of Arthur Davis, a renowned Hebrew scholar who dedicated his life to promoting Jewish culture and language. Davis's work, including his writings on Hebrew accents and his role in editing the Festival Prayer Book, has contributed to the revival of Hebrew as a living language. The concept of a \"Chosen People\" has long been a source of irritation for non-Jews, with some critics arguing that it implies spiritual supremacy over other nations. However, this idea has also been echoed in other cultures, such as Germanism, which has evolved its own doctrine of special election. The author notes that Judaism's concept of election has been misunderstood and misrepresented, and that it is not unique to the Jewish people."

This period, marked by struggles with France and the establishment of colonies, saw the emergence of a sense of British exceptionalism, with the nation viewing itself as a \"Chosen People\". The concept of a national mission, however, is often retrospective, with nations ascribing purposes to themselves that they were not originally conscious of. Britain's poets, such as Kipling, later spiritualized the doctrine of the Chosen People, presenting the nation as an instrument of God's purpose. The evolution of a national mission is a gradual process, as seen in the example of Israel, which took over a thousand years to perfect its conception of itself as a people chosen for world-service."

In reality, Germanism has more affinities with Japan, where the individual is also sacrificed to the state. The true nature of Germanism is revealed in its glorification of war and the \"Will-to-Power\" philosophy, which is a perversion of nobler ideals. Germany's transformation into a militaristic and industrial power is seen as a degeneration of its nobler soul, and its actions are a threat to civilization.

In contrast, German literature often lacks self-criticism, with some exceptions from Jewish writers like Maximilian Harden. The author suggests that Judaism has a valuable contribution to make in building a new \"City of God\" amidst the crisis of civilization, and that its universalist genius can be rekindled.
