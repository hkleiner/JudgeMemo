As they traveled, they encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Machuangtzu, where they met women wearing a unique costume and learned about the tribe's history and language. The Sarö Yögurs, also known as \"yellow barbarians\" by the Chinese, claim to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago. The village has a small temple, where seven or eight lamas live and earn a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history, legends, or songs with the expedition."

        "section_summary": "The Yögur people live in uncomfortable tents, but despite their difficult living conditions, they maintain a relatively clean and tidy lifestyle. Their diet consists of traditional nomadic foods such as tea, roasted flour, and meat, which they eat with Chinese chopsticks or their fingers. The Yögurs are a peaceful and content people, with no evidence of quarreling or dissatisfaction, and they spend their evenings singing, praying, and socializing around the fire. Their livestock, including yaks, sheep, and horses, appear to be of good quality, but the Yögurs have not fully recovered from the losses they suffered during the Dungan revolt. The Yögurs do not seem to engage in sports or hunting, and their only notable activity is target practice with rifles, which they obtain from Sinin."

They followed a narrow valley with steep grassy slopes and eventually arrived at the Lansor's or Neiman-gol valley, where they rode along the river and passed through a picturesque landscape. The author then arrived at the Chinese town of Li-yen, also known as \"the garden of pear trees\", which was surrounded by tall willow trees and steep hills. The author was warmly received by the friendly old mandarin, who sent them a delicious dinner and showed them great courtesy. The author eventually left Li-yen and continued their journey to Kanchenp'u and then Kanchow."
