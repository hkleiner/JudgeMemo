He is considered a direct descendant of the Dutch master Pieter Brueghel, who is now recognized as one of the greatest painters of peasant life. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, absorbing sincerity, and subtleties of line and tone, which were influenced by his study of Italian Renaissance masters. His paintings, such as \"The Angelus\", convey a sense of melancholy and earnestness, and are not sentimental, but rather a truthful portrayal of the struggles and simple faith of peasant life. Millet's unique style and technique, shaped by his own life experiences and connection to the natural world, have secured his position as a great artist, even if he may not be considered a technical virtuoso."

He was particularly drawn to depicting the struggles and loneliness of peasant labor, as seen in works like \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\". Millet's art is best understood as a means to convey his philosophical observations, rather than solely as a demonstration of technical painting skill."

Jean-François Millet was born into a peasant family in Gruchy, Normandy, and his upbringing had a profound impact on his later work as an artist. His family's simple and laborious life, surrounded by the rugged and picturesque landscape of Normandy, influenced his artistic style and themes. Millet's early life was marked by a strong connection to nature and a love for literature, which he developed through reading and drawing. He began to develop his artistic skills at a young age, drawing objects around him and eventually creating more complex works, such as a large drawing of two shepherds guarding their sheep."

He was apprenticed to a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg, and later to M. Langlois, who tried to mold him in the classical tradition, but Millet eventually struck out on his own. With Langlois' support, Millet received a modest pension from the Municipal Council to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of great masters at the Louvre. In Paris, Millet was drawn to the works of Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, and he developed a critically independent mind, but he struggled to find his place in the artistic establishment. He eventually became disillusioned with his teacher, Delaroche, and stopped attending his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties."

His paintings, such as \"The Angelus\" and \"Man with the Hoe\", would later become highly valued and influential, with some selling for large sums of money.
