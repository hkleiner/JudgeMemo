Ramsey's ship, the Polaris, is among those grounded, and he is forced to surrender his pilot's license. With no ship to pilot, Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the situation is resolved, and he visits his friend Stu Englander, a fellow pilot who is also struggling financially. Englander is desperate and considers looking for a job in the New Quarter, but Ramsey offers to help him out with a loan. The planetarization of the Transfer Service is expected to give Irwadi a monopoly on the vital metal titanium, which is essential for interstellar travel."

They hear a beautiful, otherworldly music, which Vardin identifies as the \"Music of the Spheres,\" a legend from her home planet of Vega III. As the fog surrounding them begins to lift, a black rectangular object, a matter-transmitter, appears, and Margot is drawn to it, realizing its potential to control the galaxy. Ramsey has a vision of Margot playing a cosmic game of chess with a being known as proto-man, and he tries to stop her from reaching the transmitter. Meanwhile, Garr Symm and his men arrive, attempting to stop Margot and claim the transmitter for themselves, leading to a confrontation with Ramsey."

Vardin, a Proto-man, revealed that his people had discovered matter-transmission, but it ultimately led to their downfall, causing them to devolve into savages. Garr Symm, who had used the matter-transmission device, emerged with the face of his caveman ancestors, illustrating the devastating consequences of the technology. Vardin, a guardian, had been trying to prevent humans from acquiring this power, and with his mission accomplished, he disappeared. Ramsey and Margot, who had developed feelings for each other, left the planet and blasted off into space, ready to start a new life together."
