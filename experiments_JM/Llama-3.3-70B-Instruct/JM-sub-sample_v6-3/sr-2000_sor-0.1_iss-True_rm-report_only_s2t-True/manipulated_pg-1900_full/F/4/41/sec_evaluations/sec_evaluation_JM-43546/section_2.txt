- [GRAMMAR] occasional grammatical errors (e.g., "with a big hug, and then subsided panting beside Sandy" seems out of place)

- [STRUCTURE] the text jumps abruptly between different topics (e.g., from discussing Uncle Alan to talking about the puppy)
- [TRANSITION] transitions between paragraphs or ideas could be smoother
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it difficult to follow the narrative
