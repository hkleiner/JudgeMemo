        "section_summary": "The author reflects on how Christmas has lost its magic and excitement for adults, who now have to force themselves to enjoy the holiday. In contrast, children still experience the thrill and wonder of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what keeps the spirit of the holiday alive. The author argues that this decline in adult enthusiasm is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine change in the way people experience Christmas. The author suggests that Christmas was once a truly special and romantic occasion, but has now become more of a routine and commercialized event. The decline of Christmas magic is a fact that the author believes should be acknowledged and understood, rather than ignored or denied."

This era of skepticism has led people to abandon faith and principles, seeking only facts and dismissing sentiment and enthusiasm. However, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, including faith, goodwill, and joy, remain intact and are essential for human dignity and existence. The Christmas feast was fixed on December 25 to coincide with the winter solstice, a symbolic moment of hope and renewal, which remains relevant today. Despite the changes in human understanding and knowledge, the underlying idea of faith and goodwill that underpins Christmas will endure as long as humanity exists."

Despite differences, mankind is a fellowship of brothers, and the idea of social justice, which emphasizes the brotherhood of mankind, is a flourishing faith. The concept of universal goodwill is alive and well, inspiring many to work towards creating a more just and equitable society. The author argues that festivals, such as Christmas, are necessary to celebrate and foster this faith, providing a concrete symbol of the invisible and intangible spirit of goodwill. By embracing the traditions and customs of Christmas, such as gift-giving and good-wishing, people can reaffirm their commitment to mutual goodwill and trust."

Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those closest to them, such as family members or colleagues. The key to cultivating goodwill is to use one's imagination to understand and sympathize with others, putting oneself in their shoes and sharing their feelings and experiences. This requires effort and a willingness to set aside one's own biases and prejudices, but it can lead to genuine connections and a deeper sense of understanding. By practicing goodwill towards those around them, individuals can create a ripple effect of kindness and compassion that can spread to others."

This exercise, though challenging, leads to a decrease in egotism and an increase in sympathy, allowing individuals to see themselves in others and understand that their own struggles are not unique. As a result, one's relationships with others become more meaningful, and even acquaintances can be regarded as friends. The practice of sympathetic imagination also enhances one's ability to show genuine interest and care for others, making interactions more sincere and enjoyable. Ultimately, this cultivation of goodwill can lead to a deeper appreciation for the value of companionship and mutual understanding in life."
