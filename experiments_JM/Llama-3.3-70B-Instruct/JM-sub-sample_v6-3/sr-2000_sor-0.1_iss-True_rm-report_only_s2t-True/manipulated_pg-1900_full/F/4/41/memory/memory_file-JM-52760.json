Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy called for a two-pronged attack, with General Ulysses S. Grant leading the effort against Richmond and Petersburg, while General William T. Sherman marched towards Atlanta. Grant's army engaged in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but was unable to defeat the Confederate army, leading him to shift his focus to Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key step towards ultimately abandoning Richmond and ending the war."

The city's defenses, known as the \"Dimmock Line,\" were constructed in 1862-1863, but its length and size made it difficult to defend with the available troops. In June 1864, Union forces led by General Grant launched an attack on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River and launching a fierce attack on the Dimmock Line. The Confederates were forced to withdraw and establish new defensive positions, but they were able to hold off the Union advances with the help of reinforcements from General Lee's command. The battle raged on for several days, with intense fighting and heavy losses on both sides, but the Confederates were ultimately able to maintain control of the city."

The Union Army then shifted its strategy to a siege, with the goal of capturing the city through a process of attrition that would last for nine months. Meanwhile, a group of Union soldiers, including coal miners, devised a plan to dig a tunnel under the Confederate lines and blow up a key fortification, known as Pegram's Salient. The tunnel, which was completed on July 30, 1864, was a remarkable feat of engineering that used a ventilating chimney to supply fresh air to the diggers."

Despite some Confederate victories, including a surprise attack on Hancock's II Corps, the Union army continued to push westward, capturing key territory and extending their lines. The Battle of Peebles' Farm in late September and early October further pushed the Union lines westward, although they were stopped short of the Southside Railroad.

The prolonged siege of Petersburg had taken a toll on both armies, with soldiers on both sides experiencing boredom, hunger, and hardship. The Confederates were particularly struggling with food shortages and desertion, with their effective troop strength dwindling to just over 56,000 by March 1865. The siege would eventually come to an end in April 1865, when Union forces broke through the outer defenses of the city, leading to the evacuation of Petersburg and the eventual surrender of Confederate forces."

The attack, which took place on March 25, initially succeeded, but was ultimately repelled by Union forces, resulting in heavy Confederate casualties, with over 4,000 killed, wounded, or captured.

The defenders of Fort Gregg put up a stubborn fight, but were eventually overwhelmed, and the Confederate lines were breached. Despite a desperate defense, Lee and other Southern leaders realized that all hope of retaining Petersburg and Richmond was lost, and they began a retreat to Amelia Court House. The Union army took possession of Petersburg on April 3, and Richmond surrendered shortly after, marking a significant turning point in the war. The fall of Petersburg ultimately led to the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House, and the end of the Civil War."
