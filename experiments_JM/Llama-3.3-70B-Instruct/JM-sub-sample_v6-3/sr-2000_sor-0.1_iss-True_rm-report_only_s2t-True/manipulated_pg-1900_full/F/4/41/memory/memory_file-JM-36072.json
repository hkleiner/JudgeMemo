The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country, with a self-contained village system and a sparse population, governed by a cultivated and enlightened aristocracy. However, the French Revolution and the subsequent war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and kindled a strong sense of nationalism in England, isolating it from European thought. The Victorian era, which spanned the latter half of the 19th century, was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order."

However, the working class suffered greatly, with poverty, illiteracy, and over-population being major issues. The government faced immense challenges, including famine and economic crises, which led to the implementation of flawed policies such as the system of doles. Critics like Disraeli, Carlyle, and Ruskin denounced the social and economic conditions of the time, with Ruskin arguing that the decay of art and beauty was closely linked to faulty social arrangements and the Industrial Revolution. The era was marked by a mix of complacency and social indignation, with many calling for reform and a return to simpler, more virtuous ways of living."

        "section_summary": "During Queen Victoria's reign, social reformers like Ruskin and Morris criticized the social and economic systems of the time, highlighting issues like industrialism and inequality. The administration of the Law was also flawed, with two separate systems of judicature, Law and Equity, leading to inefficiencies and injustices. The Universities, Civil Service, and Army were also in need of reform, with the Universities emerging from a period of decline, the Civil Service being a sanctuary of aristocratic jobbery, and the Army being underfunded and poorly managed. Despite these challenges, the period saw significant progress and improvements, with reforms in the Law, Universities, and Army, and the growth of optimism and good governance. By the end of the reign, England had made significant strides in various areas, including finance, education, and science, earning praise from historians like Lecky, who considered it a period of good governance."

The dramatic duel between Gladstone and Disraeli dominated party politics, while foreign policy was marred by blunders such as the Opium War and the Crimean War. The era also saw the rise of nationalism, militarism, and protectionism, which ultimately led to the decline of international cooperation and the increase in competitive armaments. In literature, the Romantic movement gave way to a new generation of writers, including Alfred Tennyson, who became a prominent figure in Victorian literature. The Victorian era was a time of great prosperity and cultural achievement, but its advantages were temporary and would eventually give way to new challenges and uncertainties."

Despite being seen as shallow, Tennyson's work, such as the Idylls of the King, is actually an allegory that explores deeper themes and convictions. He was aware of the social and political changes of his time, including the rise of materialism and revolution, and expressed his concerns and disillusionments in poems like the second Locksley Hall. Tennyson's religious views were also typical of his age, representing a Victorian attitude that was open to doubt and questioning of traditional dogma. Overall, Tennyson's work reflects the complexities and contradictions of his time, and his poetry remains a significant and thought-provoking part of English literature."

However, the age was also marked by vulgarity and materialism, with the Industrial Revolution bringing about significant social and economic changes. As the era drew to a close, societal disintegration and antagonistic movements began to emerge, threatening the stability of English civilization. Ultimately, the Victorian era is seen as a peak in English civilization, with the country's future prospects uncertain in the face of global changes and shifting power dynamics."
