In contrast, children still experience the wonder and joy of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what keeps the spirit of the holiday alive. The author argues that Christmas was not always a children's holiday, but was once a deeply meaningful and exciting celebration for adults as well. The fact that children still believe in the magic of Christmas suggests that it was once a powerful and significant holiday for adults, who have since lost their sense of wonder and enthusiasm. The author believes that acknowledging the decline of Christmas is the first step to understanding and addressing the issue, rather than simply denying or ignoring it."

Despite this, the author argues that the core of Christmas, which is faith and goodwill, remains intact and is essential for humanity to live with dignity and purpose. The date of Christmas, December 25, was chosen to coincide with the winter solstice, a time of renewal and hope, and this symbolism remains relevant today. The author suggests that even with our advanced knowledge of the world, we are still at the mercy of nature and should approach the forces that govern our existence with reverence and awe. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit, which is about faith, goodwill, and joy, is immortal and will endure despite the changing times."

While acknowledging that excess can be taken too far, the author believes that moderate excess is a necessary part of the festive experience, allowing people to expand beyond their common sense and indulge in ridiculous and joyful activities. The author also critiques the idea of replacing traditional festivals with more modern or intellectual celebrations, arguing that festivals are affairs of the emotions, not the intellect. Instead, the author suggests that the key to revitalizing the Christmas festival is to focus on cultivating goodwill among people, which is a fundamental and enduring aspect of the holiday's spirit. By concentrating on goodwill, the festival can be revitalized without overhauling its traditional forms."

Instead, one should focus on developing goodwill towards a small group of people, starting with those closest to them, such as family members or colleagues. The key to cultivating goodwill is to imagine oneself in the other person's shoes and understand their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This requires effort, imagination, and a willingness to set aside one's own biases and prejudices. By doing so, one can build genuine relationships and increase goodwill, which is essential for human happiness."

This exercise, although challenging and time-consuming, can lead to a significant change in one's attitude and behavior towards others, making it easier to empathize and show kindness. As a result, one's relationships with others can become more meaningful and enjoyable, and even festivals like Christmas can take on a new significance as a celebration of friendship and companionship. The systematic cultivation of goodwill can also lead to a decline in egotism and a greater sense of connection with others, ultimately resulting in an increase in one's own happiness. By practicing this exercise, one can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of others, leading to more fulfilling relationships and a more joyful life."
