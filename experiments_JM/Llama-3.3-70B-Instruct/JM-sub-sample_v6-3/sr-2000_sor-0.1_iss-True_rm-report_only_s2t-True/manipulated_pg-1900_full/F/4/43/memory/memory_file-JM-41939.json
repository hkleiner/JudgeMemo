        "section_summary": "Rosa Bonheur was born in 1822 to a family of artists, with her father Raymond Bonheur being a painter and her mother Sophie Marquis a musician. Growing up in an artistic environment, Rosa developed a passion for drawing and painting from a young age. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was enrolled in a boys' school and later apprenticed to a dressmaker, but she showed no interest in these pursuits. Eventually, her father allowed her to work in his studio, where she created her first painting, a still life of cherries, which demonstrated her artistic talent. With her father's encouragement, Rosa dedicated herself to her art, spending hours copying the works of great masters at the Louvre and embarking on a path to become a successful artist."

She developed a passion for painting animals, and her dedication to her work led to her first exhibits at the Salon in 1841, where her paintings were accepted and praised. Rosa's success grew progressively, with her exhibits in the Salon of 1845 and 1846 receiving critical acclaim, and she was eventually awarded a first-class medal in 1848. Her hard work and perseverance paid off, as she became known for her honest and sincere depictions of animals, which were rendered with intense relief and fidelity. Through her journey, Rosa was supported by her father and later by her friend and fellow artist, Mlle. Micas, who helped her with her work and provided companionship."

Despite its initial lack of a buyer, the painting was eventually sold to Mr. Gambard for 40,000 francs and later changed hands several times, eventually being sold to Mr. Vanderbilt for $53,000. Rosa Bonheur's dedication to her art and her honesty were evident in her actions, including her decision to paint a second replica of \"The Horse Fair\" for the National Gallery. Her success allowed her to move to a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which she had built to suit her needs and transformed into a veritable farm and menagerie."

Rosa Bonheur's work was particularly popular in England, where she found a strong market for her paintings of rural life, and she eventually gave up exhibiting at the Salons to focus on private commissions. In 1865, she was awarded the Legion of Honour by the Empress, recognizing her contributions to the art world."

She later sent 10 of her works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a second-class medal, which was seen as a snub due to her long absence from the French art scene and her focus on English patrons. Rosa Bonheur had previously run an art school for young girls, which she directed with devotion and intelligence, but eventually resigned in 1860 to focus on her own art. After retiring from public life, she worked tirelessly on her paintings, which were in high demand and brought her great financial success. During the Franco-Prussian War, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity by aiding peasants and refusing favors from Prussian officers, demonstrating her commitment to her country and her values."
