Section section_05 (Chars 34722–43387):
Section Summary: Living well in Manila is expensive, as the cost of goods, especially food, is high due to the expense of shipping from other countries. In contrast, life in rural areas is simple and quiet, with a focus on traditional ways of living and a lack of modern amenities. The traditional Filipino home is characterized by a unique arrangement of furniture, with a mirror, settee, and chairs placed in a specific way to facilitate conversation and social interaction. The lifestyle of Filipinos varies greatly depending on their social class, with the wealthy enjoying a high standard of living and the poor, known as the "tao", struggling to access basic necessities like food. Overall, life in the Philippines is marked by stark contrasts between urban and rural areas, and between different social classes.

A second attempt with guides and interpreters was successful, and the writer encountered a community of people suffering from leprosy, who were living in a secluded area. Despite their condition, the writer observed that the community was filled with love, marriage, and children, and that the human emotions of sorrow, joy, and hatred were still present. In a separate incident, the writer joined a group of soldiers on a "hike" to pursue a band of ladrones who had burned a sugar mill and were threatening to sack a nearby town. The pursuit was ultimately unsuccessful, but it provided a glimpse into the primitive conditions and contrasting cultures of the Filipino people and American soldiers.

Section Summary: The travelers had grown tired of hiking and hired a native to drive them in his cart, pulled by a carabao.

Despite the rough ride, they slept soundly, only waking up when the sun was high in the sky, shining down on their faces. When they awoke, they were approaching a small village at the foot of the mountains. In the village, they procured ponies to take them back to their post.
