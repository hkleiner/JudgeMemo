        "section_summary": "Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying the effects of cavalry on a field of grain. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier's early life was marked by a humble beginning, with his father being a dealer in colonial products and his mother being a fragile woman with a talent for painting on porcelain. Meissonier's own artistic journey began when he discovered his mother's old paint-box, and despite not being a good student, he showed a natural talent for drawing. His father, however, was initially hesitant to encourage his artistic pursuits, given the tumultuous state of the art world at the time, and instead attempted to steer him towards a more practical career as a druggist's apprentice. Meissonier's dedication to realism and his commitment to capturing the truth of nature would become the hallmark of his artistic career."

Despite facing financial struggles, Meissonier persevered and eventually gained recognition for his work, exhibiting for the first time at the age of 16. He began to gain traction as an illustrator, working with publishers such as Curmer, and his breakthrough came with his illustrations for \"The Indian Cabin\", which showcased his attention to detail and realism. This success marked the beginning of his rise to fame, and he soon found himself in demand, no longer needing to solicit work. Meissonier's career as an artist was finally taking off, and he would go on to become a renowned painter, known for his meticulous and detailed works."

Meissonier's paintings are notable for their small scale, but this is not seen as a limitation, as they are intended to be intimate and detailed, inviting the viewer to draw closer. The small size of his paintings is actually a deliberate choice, allowing for a focus on subtle details and expressive physiognomies. Meissonier's talent and technique enabled him to create works of great intensity and precision, despite their small size, and his paintings are highly regarded for their unique qualities."

Fortunately, his genre painting \"The Reader\" received praise, encouraging him to stay true to himself. Meissonier's success grew rapidly, with each subsequent painting earning him increasing distinction, including a second-class medal and a significant sale to collector Paul Périer. His paintings were notable for their attention to detail, realism, and ability to convey the character and individuality of his subjects. Meissonier's unique style and talent were recognized by critics, including Théophile Gautier, who praised his ability to compose pictures with a deep understanding of human nature and character."

Meissonier's paintings also include military scenes, such as \"Napoleon III at Solférino\", which he created after attaching himself to the Imperial Staff of the French army in 1859. He was known for his attention to detail and his desire for accuracy, often going to great lengths to get his subjects to pose for him.

Despite criticism of his lack of color and grace, Meissonier's work was notable for its realism and exactitude, which he achieved through meticulous observation and documentation. He was particularly fond of painting horses, which he saw as a subject of great beauty and complexity. Meissonier's dedication to his craft and commitment to honesty and accuracy earned him great respect and admiration, culminating in his election as president of the Exposition Universelle des Beaux-Arts in 1889."

He had a vast collection of relics and clothing from the Imperial Epoch, which he used to inform his paintings. Meissonier's attention to detail was so intense that he even researched the way linen was cut in the 18th century to achieve more realistic folds in his subjects' clothing. Despite his thorough preparation, he was often dissatisfied with his finished paintings, and was known to have destroyed works that others considered perfect. This level of dedication and self-criticism defines Meissonier's talent and glory as an artist."
