However, he was actually passionate about discovering the world around him, asking questions, and learning through hands-on experiences. He spent his time exploring nature, collecting specimens, and learning about music, even inventing his own instruments and repairing others. As he grew older, Tony's skills in music and instrument repair became more refined, earning him the trust of the villagers, who would bring him their broken instruments to fix. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother, although sometimes perplexed by his ways, loved and supported him."

Despite this, Anthony's passion for music and instrument-making only grew stronger, and he spent his days studying and learning about violins. At the age of 17, he made a significant discovery - a piece of 80-90 year old wood from a rare maple tree, which he carefully set aside to use for making a perfect violin in the future. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he knew more in one day than the teacher would ever know in a year. With his mother's support, Anthony continued to pursue his dream of making perfect violins, inspired by the likes of Antonius Stradivarius."

As she settled into her new home, the community was slow to get used to her presence, and Aunt Hitty was particularly disapproving of Lyddy's decision to remove the silver coffin-plates that her aunt had displayed. Lyddy, despite being nearly 40, was still young at heart and had a deep well of unexpressed emotions, which made her a complex and intriguing character."
