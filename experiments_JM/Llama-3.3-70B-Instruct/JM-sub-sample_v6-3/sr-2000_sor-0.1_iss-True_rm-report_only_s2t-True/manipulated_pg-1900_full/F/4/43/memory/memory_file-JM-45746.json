The author then contrasts the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who treated it as a mere job and another who approached it as a profession, taking initiative and showing enthusiasm for improving education. The second young man's efforts to create a comfortable and attractive learning environment led to his success and eventual promotion to a leadership role. The author emphasizes the importance of a pleasing and forceful personality in a teacher's success, citing their own experience with an inspirational principal who motivated them to complete their education. Ultimately, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession, and the impact this mindset can have on one's success and effectiveness as an educator."
