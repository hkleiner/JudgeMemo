        "section_summary": "In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury to experience its beauty and historic charm."

In 597, Augustine and his missionaries arrived in Canterbury, and Ethelbert allowed them to preach and instruct his people, leading to the conversion of many Saxons, including the king himself. The city became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The early Christian churches in Canterbury, including St. Martin's and St. Augustine's, played a significant role in the Christianization of England, and the city continued to grow and prosper despite attacks by the Danes. The city's cathedral, Christ Church, was eventually rebuilt after being burnt down by the Danes in 1011, and it remains a central part of the Church of England to this day."

The new cathedral was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed a new Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. In 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in the cathedral by four knights, who had been sent by King Henry II. The events leading up to the murder are described in detail, including the tense conversation between Becket and the knights. The cathedral has undergone significant changes over the centuries, but it remains a notable example of Norman architecture and a testament to the city's rich history."

The monks, upon discovering Becket's austere and ascetic lifestyle, including a hair-cloth shirt and numerous scars from self-scourging, immediately revered him as a saint. The news of Becket's martyrdom spread rapidly, and his relics became highly valued for their perceived healing properties, attracting numerous pilgrims to Canterbury. King Henry, seeking to atone for his role in Becket's death, performed a public penance in Canterbury, walking barefoot and receiving corporal punishment from the bishops and monks. This event marked the beginning of Canterbury's transformation into a major pilgrimage site, with the annual procession of pilgrims becoming a significant phenomenon in medieval Europe."

The Cathedral was further modified over the centuries, with additions and renovations made in the 13th to 15th centuries, including the construction of a new shrine for Becket's remains. The city's importance as a pilgrimage site and its role as a center of ecclesiastical authority helped it maintain its wealth and influence, even as it began to decline after the dissolution of the monasteries. The Cathedral remains a significant and beautiful landmark, with its mix of architectural styles and rich history continuing to attract visitors to this day."

The narrator notes that the monastic buildings, including the great hall and infirmary, are located on the north side of the Cathedral, and that the Green Court, a wide grassy space, is shaded by great limes and other trees. The Cathedral's interior is described as a vast and beautiful space, with a sense of ordered beauty that is almost overpowering. The narrator reflects on the contrast between the Cathedral's grandeur and the smallness and pettiness of everyday life, and notes that the building's appearance has changed significantly since the Reformation."

The Trinity Chapel, where the shrine of St. Thomas once stood, is now an empty space, but still evokes a deep sense of history and significance. The chapel is adorned with a fine thirteenth-century mosaic pavement and features the tombs of King Henry IV and the Black Prince, with the latter's tomb being a magnificent piece of work. The chapel's windows, which illustrate the cures wrought at the Shrine of St. Thomas, are a remarkable series of thirteenth-century glass that have survived almost unharmed."
