Section section_03 (Chars 17005–25499):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's friend and companion, Nathalie Micas, played a significant role in her life, taking care of her material welfare and serving as a good counselor. Rosa Bonheur continued to study and learn, even after achieving success, and her passion for art led her to create notable works such as "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair".

Her success and fame ultimately led her to establish a new studio in the Rue d'Assas, which was designed to meet her needs and featured a unique courtyard transformed into a farm.

Section section_05 (Chars 33810–42311):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur visited the Court and had a pleasant experience, discussing the intelligence of animals with the Emperor and going on an excursion with the Empress.

After resigning from the school, she retired to her home in By, where she worked tirelessly to fulfill orders from England and America, producing many notable works. During the war of 1870, Rosa Bonheur showed her patriotism and generosity by aiding the suffering peasants and refusing to accept favors from the Prussian invaders.
