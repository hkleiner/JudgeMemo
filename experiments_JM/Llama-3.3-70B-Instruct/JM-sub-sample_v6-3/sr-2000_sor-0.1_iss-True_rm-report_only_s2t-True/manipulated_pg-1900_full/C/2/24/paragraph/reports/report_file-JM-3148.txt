Section section_02 (Chars 7969–16094):
Section Summary: Anthony, a curious and inquisitive boy, was often considered lazy by the villagers because he didn't conform to traditional learning methods. However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself about the world around him. He had a passion for music and inventing, and spent hours taking apart and reassembling musical instruments, even creating his own unique instruments. As he grew older, Anthony's skills in repairing and restoring instruments earned him some recognition, and he was eventually trusted with valuable instruments, including a rare violin that had been hanging on a wall for decades. Through his self-directed learning and experimentation, Anthony developed a deep understanding of the world and its workings, driven by his insatiable curiosity and love for discovery.

Section section_03 (Chars 16094–24421):
Section Summary: Anthony Croft, a young boy, was deeply passionate about music and the violin, despite the village's disapproval of the instrument. He spent his days studying and practicing, and at the age of 17, he discovered a precious piece of wood from a historic maple tree that he vowed to use to make a perfect violin after it had completed its century of waiting. Anthony's dedication and natural talent earned him recognition from his school-teacher, who acknowledged that he couldn't teach him anything new. The boy's love for music and craftsmanship was inspired by the works of Antonius Stradivarius, and he aspired to follow in his footsteps. With a strong sense of purpose, Anthony began collecting and preparing beautiful woods to make perfect violins, driven by his desire to create something truly exceptional.
