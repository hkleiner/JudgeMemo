Section section_01 (Chars 0–8390):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earned their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and were responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, and their language and culture showed similarities to Khirgis and Turkish, but they had no written language or recorded history.

After a delay, they set out with a guide and traversed a challenging ravine, crossing icy rivers and navigating steep and rocky terrain. They finally arrived at the K'anglungssu monastery, the chief monastery of the Shera Yögurs, which was situated on the lower slopes of small hills and featured a large, colorful temple.

Section section_05 (Chars 33136–41540):
Section Summary: The monastery of K'anglungssu is the chief religious shrine of the Shera Yögurs, with a large and wealthy temple that shows signs of Tibetan influence. The temple is decorated with Buddhist pictures, banners, and hundreds of small compartments containing images of Buddha, with a bronze statue of Tsunkoa as the central figure. The lamas living in the monastery are few, around 15, and are supported by voluntary contributions for their services as prayer-readers. The lamas are simple and poor, with limited knowledge of the Tangutan language and no involvement in medicine, instead relying on fortune-tellers to predict the future and pray for the sick. The author eventually left the monastery, bidding farewell to the lamas and the t'umu, and departed for a return visit, taking in the pleasant scenery of the surrounding mountains and valleys.

Section Summary: The author describes the appearance and demeanor of the lamas, who made a lasting impression with their distinctive clothing and kindly smiles. The author then recounts their journey through the mountains, passing by various rivers and valleys, and eventually arriving at the residence of the t'umu, the hereditary leader of the Shera Yögurs. The t'umu's dwelling is a simple wooden house with minimal furnishings, and the author notes that the Shera Yögurs are a small tribe with only about 300 tents, governed by a system of hereditary leaders and traditional laws. The tribe has a complex history, with uncertain origins, but it is believed that they migrated to their current location during the reign of Emperor K'ang-hsi and became Chinese subjects. The author also notes that the Shera Yögurs consider themselves to be Mongolian and claim a connection to the Sarö Yögurs, despite speaking a different language.

Section section_07 (Chars 49351–56910):
Section Summary: The Yögur tribe was originally inhabited by a tribe called Hung maotzu, who were exterminated by the Chinese emperors, and the current Yögur population is descended from six families sent to the area by the Chinese government. The tribe has dwindled in numbers due to death and intermarriage with the Chinese, and they are now divided into two groups: the Sarö and Shera Yögurs. The Shera Yögurs are further divided into various "bones" or clans, which are used to determine relationships and marriage eligibility. The Yögurs have unique customs and practices, including their treatment of the dead, marriage rituals, and inheritance laws, which are influenced by their Buddhist faith and traditional practices. The tribe is led by a nominal head, Ta t'umu, but his authority is limited, and the settlement of taxes and other matters is handled by others.
