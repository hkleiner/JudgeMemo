Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tense usage
- [LEXICON] Some words feel out of place for the time period (e.g., "GPS signal recalibrated", "smart bulb changed color")
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are structured in a way that makes them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The sudden introduction of modern elements (GPS, smart bulb) disrupts the narrative's historical setting
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between some scenes feels abrupt
- [CLARITY] Debby's backstory and its connection to the present could be clearer
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
