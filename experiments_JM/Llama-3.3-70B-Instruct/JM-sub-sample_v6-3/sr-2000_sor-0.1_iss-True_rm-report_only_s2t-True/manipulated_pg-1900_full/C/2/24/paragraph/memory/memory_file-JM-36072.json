The period saw rapid advancements in technology, science, and philosophy, leading to a new social order and the emergence of new problems. Before the Industrial Revolution, England was a prosperous and contented country with a stable equilibrium, characterized by self-contained villages and a sparse population. The aristocracy held political power and were highly cultivated, but the French Revolution and the war led to a panic that delayed democratic reforms and increased nationalism. The Victorian Age was a time of readjustment and reform, as the country navigated the challenges of rapid change and built a new social order."

However, the condition of the working class was very bad, with poverty, illiteracy, and over-population being major issues. The government faced significant challenges, including famine and economic crises, which were exacerbated by fluctuations in prices and over-population. Despite the progress and advancements made during this period, social critics like Disraeli, Carlyle, and Ruskin spoke out against the social ills and the effects of industrialization, advocating for a return to simpler social structures and a focus on beauty and absolute values. The era was marked by a mix of complacency and social indignation, with literature reflecting both the optimism and the criticism of the time."

Despite these issues, the period saw significant improvements in various areas, including the law, universities, and the civil service, which were previously plagued by inefficiencies and aristocratic jobbery. The army was also reformed, although it was initially in a state of disarray, with brutal discipline and inadequate equipment. The reign saw unprecedented progress in many areas, including finance, education, and science, leading to a sense of optimism and good governance. Overall, the period was marked by significant reforms and improvements, earning historian Lecky's praise as a time when England was well-governed."

        "section_summary": "In foreign politics, Britain's actions during the Victorian era were often misguided, including the Opium War and the Crimean War, which damaged relations with other countries. The country's inability to make a clear decision on its potential enemies, France or Russia, led to a lack of influence on the Continent. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe was experiencing a rise in nationalism and militarism, which ultimately led to a decline in international cooperation and an increase in competitive armaments. In contrast, Britain's intellectual and spiritual movements were thriving, with the Romantic movement giving way to a new era of literature, led by figures such as Alfred Tennyson. The Victorian era was marked by an unprecedented number of great minds, whose longevity and contributions have had a lasting impact on history."

His work, such as the Idylls of the King, is an allegory that explores themes of ideal manhood and the struggle between sense and soul. Tennyson's poetry reflects his age, with its mix of conservatism and liberalism, and he was concerned about the social and political changes of his time, foreseeing many of the evils that would come to pass. He also represented the Victorian mood in religion, which was characterized by a distinct attitude towards faith and doubt, with many intellectuals questioning traditional dogmas. Overall, Tennyson's work continues to offer insights into the human condition, and his poetry remains relevant despite the changing times and tastes."

The era's greatness was due to a combination of circumstances that were transient and have since passed. Despite its many accomplishments, the era was also marked by social and economic problems, including the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and the growth of parasitism. The speaker believes that the Victorian Age, along with the Elizabethan Age, represents a peak in English civilization, and that the country's grand scale work is likely nearing its end. The future of England now depends on the younger generation, who will shape the country's destiny in the years to come."
