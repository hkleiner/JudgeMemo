Section section_04 (Chars 26502–35300):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's family encouraged his artistic talent, and his father took him to meet a painter named Mouchel in Cherbourg. After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm to manage it, but he eventually returned to Cherbourg to pursue his art studies under M. Langlois. Langlois, who had a classical influence, tried to mold Millet's style, but Millet struck out on his own, frequenting museums and making copies of works that appealed to him. With Langlois' help, Millet received a modest pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who had a profound influence on his artistic development. Millet eventually placed himself under the tutelage of Delaroche, but found his style and teachings to be unsuitable, leading him to cease attending the studio and strike out on his own once again.
