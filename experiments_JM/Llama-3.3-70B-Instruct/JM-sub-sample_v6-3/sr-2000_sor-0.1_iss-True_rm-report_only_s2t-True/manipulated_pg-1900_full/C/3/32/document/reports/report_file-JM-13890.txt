Section section_01 (Chars 0–8527):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Roman occupation, the city was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance have endured, making it a popular destination for pilgrims and travelers to this day.

Section section_02 (Chars 8528–17022):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the King of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the King and many Saxons to Christianity. The city of Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The early Christian churches in Canterbury, including St. Martin's and St. Augustine's, were built using Roman materials and were the center of the Christianizing of England. Despite being attacked and damaged by the Danes, Canterbury continued to grow and prosper, with its cathedral and churches remaining an important part of English history and Christianity.

Section section_03 (Chars 17023–25775):
Section Summary: King Canute demonstrated his submission to the Church by hanging his crown in the cathedral and helping to repair and decorate the Saxon cathedral. After a fire destroyed the cathedral, Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, rebuilt it in the Norman style, incorporating a crypt from the original church. The new cathedral was completed in 1077, and later, Prior Ernulph constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of Thomas Becket's murder, which made Canterbury a famous resort for pilgrims. The events surrounding Becket's murder, including his final interview with the four knights who killed him, are a significant part of the cathedral's history.

Section section_04 (Chars 25776–34393):
Section Summary: Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was murdered by four knights in the cathedral after a heated argument. The knights, fueled by anger and a desire for revenge, attacked Becket, who refused to back down or flee, and killed him with multiple sword strokes. Despite being a divisive figure in life, Becket was quickly revered as a saint and martyr, with many seeking relics from his body and clothing, which were believed to have healing properties. King Henry, who had inadvertently sparked the murder, later performed a public penance, walking barefoot to the cathedral and receiving physical punishment from bishops and monks to atone for his role in Becket's death. The event ultimately led to Canterbury becoming a major pilgrimage site, with thousands of people traveling to the city to honor Becket's memory and seek spiritual healing.

Section section_05 (Chars 34394–43289):
Section Summary: The city of Canterbury was a major pilgrimage site, with vast crowds of people visiting the Cathedral to see the shrine of Thomas Becket. The Cathedral suffered a fire in the 12th century, which led to the rebuilding of the choir by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, a mix of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Over the centuries, the Cathedral underwent further changes, including the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style, and the construction of a new central tower. The city's popularity as a pilgrimage site continued to grow, with royal visits and grand festivals, until its decline began with the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of Becket's shrine. Despite this decline, Canterbury remained an important center of the English Church and continued to thrive, with its rich history and architecture still evident today.

Section section_06 (Chars 43290–51891):
Section Summary: The narrator walks through the weather-worn gateway of the Cathedral, taking in the vast pile of the building and its various architectural features, including the western towers, nave, and Angel Tower. The Cathedral's history and construction are evident in its mix of Norman and Perpendicular styles, with various additions and rebuilds over the centuries. The surrounding precincts include the remains of monastic buildings, such as the infirmary and treasury, as well as the Prior's Gate and the Green Court. The narrator notes the contrast between the ordered beauty of the Cathedral and the chaos of everyday life, and describes the interior of the building as a magnificent vestibule to the crowded interest beyond the transept. The Cathedral's original splendor, with its paintings, medieval glass, and sumptuous hangings, has been lost, but the building remains as a testament to the endeavors of monastic life.

Section section_07 (Chars 51892–60523):
Section Summary: The arch at the cathedral is a notable feature, with its reticulated stonework and bold simplicity of design. The cathedral contains various monuments, including those to Dean Farrar, William Broughton, and Orlando Gibbons, as well as the tomb of Lady Margaret Holland and her two husbands. The Trinity Chapel is a significant part of the cathedral, where the shrine of St. Thomas once stood, and it features a 13th-century mosaic pavement and the tombs of Henry IV and the Black Prince. The chapel's windows, which date back to before 1220, are a remarkable example of 13th-century glasswork and depict the cures wrought at the shrine of St. Thomas. The cathedral's crypt is also of interest, with its Perpendicular screenwork and historic significance as a place of worship and refuge for French Protestant refugees.

Section section_08 (Chars 60524–68783):
Section Summary: The walled city of Canterbury still retains much of its historic charm, with its old walls, gates, and narrow streets evoking a sense of romance and pre-Reformation England. Despite the destruction of many of its old gates, one remains, thanks to the Mayor's casting vote in 1850, which rejected a proposal to demolish it to facilitate a circus procession. The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, are still impressive, although the Abbey had fallen into disrepair and was used for debased purposes before being rescued and restored in 1844. The city also boasts many other interesting sites, including old inns, domestic architecture, and churches, such as St. Martin's and St. Dunstan's, which preserve relics of the past. Overall, Canterbury has a rich history and architecture that is still worth exploring today.
