Section section_09 (Chars 68453–77035):
Section Summary: The author, Will Bradley, was recalled from retirement to improve the printing of illustrations for the Hearst organization, but his suggestions were deemed too radical by Ray Long.

The author reflects on the current state of illustration and design, praising the work of modern illustrators and their use of imaginative composition and color. In contrast to his own time, Bradley believes that young designers and printers today have greater opportunities due to advances in technology, training, and typographic consciousness.
