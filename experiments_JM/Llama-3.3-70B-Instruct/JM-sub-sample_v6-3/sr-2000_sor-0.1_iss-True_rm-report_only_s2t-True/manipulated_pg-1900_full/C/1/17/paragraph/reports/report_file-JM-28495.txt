Section section_01 (Chars 0–8256):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief from a street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and humorous.

Section section_02 (Chars 8257–16549):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife Stella attempted to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but they ended up on a wild goose chase through the streets. Eventually, the man led them to his home, where he and his wife disappeared, leaving the narrator and Stella exhausted and dogless. Later, while walking home across a golf course, they found a small, wet puppy that had been thrown into a pond with a brick tied to it. They took the puppy in and spent three days deciding on a name, finally settling on Excalibur, or "Scally" for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a unique and humble-minded companion, with a rather unusual appearance.

Section section_03 (Chars 16550–24765):
Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and affectionate dog, would often accompany his owner on walks, despite attempts to discourage him. He was a gentle giant, with a strong desire to make friends, but was often rebuffed by other dogs. Excalibur had a special fondness for children and babies, and would often play with them or try to interact with them. One notable incident involved Excalibur being given a shoulder of mutton, which he devoured and then forgot where he had buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often caused chaos, but his loving nature and courtly manners made him a beloved member of the family.

Section Summary: Excalibur, a large and friendly dog, would often accompany his owner Eileen on daily walks, introducing him to various people and experiences in the village.
