They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. Upon arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are met with mischief from a street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and humorous."

Eventually, the man led them to his home, where he and his wife disappeared, leaving the narrator and Stella exhausted and dogless. Later, while walking home across a golf course, they found a small, wet puppy that had been thrown into a pond with a brick tied to it. They took the puppy in and spent three days deciding on a name, finally settling on Excalibur, or \"Scally\" for short. As the puppy grew up, it became a unique and humble-minded companion, with a rather unusual appearance."

One notable incident involved Excalibur being given a shoulder of mutton, which he devoured and then forgot where he had buried the bone, leading to a chaotic search. Excalibur's antics often caused chaos, but his loving nature and courtly manners made him a beloved member of the family."

Eileen followed and apologized for the intrusion, but the curate was charmed by her and invited her in, marking the beginning of a connection between them. The curate and Eileen struck up a conversation, discussing their lives and interests, and Eileen learned that the curate was new to the village and had previously worked in London.
