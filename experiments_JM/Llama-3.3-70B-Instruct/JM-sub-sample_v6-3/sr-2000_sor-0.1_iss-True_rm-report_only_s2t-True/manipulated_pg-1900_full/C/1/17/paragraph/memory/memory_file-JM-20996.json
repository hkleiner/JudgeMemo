The narrative then shifts to the Philippines, where the author describes the typical town of Bacalod and the challenges faced by American teachers who arrived to establish schools. The teachers were tasked with making English the basis of instruction and faced difficulties such as lack of schoolhouses and supplies. Despite these challenges, the teachers made progress, and by the end of a year, two schools were operating successfully in the town of Talisay. The author also recounts a social event, a \"baile,\" hosted by the town of Silay, where they were honored guests and struggled to communicate with the locals due to language barriers."

The narrator also shares their experience of trying to manage a household with Filipino servants, which proved to be challenging due to the complex system of dependents and allowances. Overall, the narrator observes that life in the Philippines is a mix of luxury and simplicity, depending on the location and social status."

The tao's diet consists mainly of rice and fish, which they eat with their hands, and they often go hungry. In contrast, the middle class of Filipinos fills the gap between the rich and the poor, with a more moderate lifestyle. The author also describes a visit to a leper colony, where they received a hostile reception from the inhabitants, highlighting the challenges and hardships faced by those living on the margins of society."

Despite the difficulties, the author notes that the people in the colony still experience emotions like love, hatred, and joy, just like anyone else.

The hike ultimately becomes too strenuous, and the author and their companion return to the post in a cart, exhausted but safe."
