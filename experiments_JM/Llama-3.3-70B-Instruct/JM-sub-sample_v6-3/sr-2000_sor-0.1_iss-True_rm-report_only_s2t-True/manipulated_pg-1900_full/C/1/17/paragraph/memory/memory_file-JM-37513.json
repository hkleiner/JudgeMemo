Spencer's essay \"Progress: its Law and Cause\" explained that progress is the evolution of the simple into the complex through successive differentiations, a concept that resonated with the author. The author believes that this essay contains the germ of all that is best in Spencer's teaching and that his method was most effectively employed in interpreting biological phenomena. Spencer's work had a significant impact on various fields, including biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and his contributions to these subjects are still recognized today. The author notes that while Spencer's rigid focus on biological relationships was a strength, it also limited his ability to consider other important relationships in his work."

He believed in the universality of law, where everything, including the mind and society, is governed by a single underlying principle. Spencer's philosophy is all-inclusive, encompassing biology, psychology, sociology, and ethics, and he sought to interpret all phenomena in terms of matter, motion, and force. However, he also acknowledged the existence of an Unknowable Reality, a source or power that drives the machinery of the world, which is beyond human understanding. Ultimately, Spencer's philosophy is characterized by its attempt to unify knowledge and provide a comprehensive explanation of the world, despite the limitations of human understanding."

Bergson criticizes Herbert Spencer's method of reconstructing evolution by dividing the evolved into fragments, arguing that this approach fails to reveal the principle of evolution. Bergson's own doctrine posits that the intellect portions the world into distinct lots, rendering them artificially separate from the continuous whole of reality. Spencer, on the other hand, seeks to understand the Source of phenomena, which he believes is the Unknowable, a fundamental tenet of his philosophy. Bergson's concept of \"original activity\" seems to parallel Spencer's Unknowable, as both are seen as producing the same results. The discussion highlights the complexities and ambiguities in Spencer's treatment of cause and effect, which has been criticized by other philosophers, including Bertrand Russell and Ernst Mach."

However, the kinds of relatedness and changes are numerous, and attempts to reduce them to a single type, like Spencer's mechanical approach, have failed. In scientific interpretation, the concept of cause is not necessary, and changes can be understood through the relatedness of things, with energy being a measure of change rather than an agent that produces it. The terms \"force\" and \"cause\" can be misleading, and it's more accurate to speak of specific modes of relatedness that lead to observable changes. Ultimately, understanding the relatedness of things and the changes that occur within a system is key to scientific interpretation, rather than relying on concepts like cause and force."

To understand the world, it is necessary to consider the specific modes of relatedness that characterize different phases of evolutionary progress, rather than reducing them to a single mechanical type.

As we move from one type to the next, new properties emerge that are not simply the sum of the previous ones, but rather constitutive of the new whole. This concept is related to the idea of \"emergent\" properties, which was discussed by philosophers such as Mill and Lewes, and is a key aspect of evolution. The author argues that these new properties are not the result of a special agency or force, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing complexity of relationships. Ultimately, the goal of scientific interpretation is to understand these relationships and properties, and to establish correlations between different levels of complexity, from physico-chemical to cognitive processes."

Spencer's concept of cognition involves a complex relationship between the organism and its environment, which he defines as the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations. However, his terminology can be perplexing, as he refers to both internal and external terms as \"states of consciousness\" or \"subjective affections.\" The author argues that an adequate analysis of cognitive relatedness is not found in Spencer's works and that a scientific philosophy must deal with it in a strictly analogous manner to other relational problems. Ultimately, the author suggests that physiological processes in organisms involve unique, vital relationships that are dependent on physico-chemical relations and imply a distinctive historical element through heredity."
