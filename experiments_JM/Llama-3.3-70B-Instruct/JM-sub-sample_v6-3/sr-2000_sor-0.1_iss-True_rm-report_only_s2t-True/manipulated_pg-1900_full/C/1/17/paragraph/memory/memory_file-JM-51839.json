According to legend, the city was founded by Nacogdoches, one of the twin sons of a Caddo chief, who was instructed to travel towards the setting sun and establish a home. The area was later visited by European explorers, including Hernando De Soto and LaSalle, and was eventually settled by Spanish missionaries, who established the Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches in 1716. The city changed hands several times, with the Spanish ceding control to the French and then back to the Spanish again, before being refounded by Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo in 1779. Today, remnants of the city's ancient past can still be seen, including a remaining mound on Mound street, which is a testament to the city's long and storied history."

The town grew rapidly and became a key location in the region, with Ybarbo serving as its leader until his removal from office in 1792. In the early 19th century, Nacogdoches was involved in several significant events, including the suppression of Philip Nolan's expedition and the Mexican Revolution against Spain. The town was also a hub for various expeditions and movements, including the Magee-Gutierrez expedition and Dr. James Long's attempt to form the Republic of Texas. By the 1820s, Nacogdoches had become a significant settlement in the region, with a diverse population and a complex history shaped by its location on the border between Spanish and American territories."

However, tensions rose between the Americans, Mexicans, and Cherokee Indians, leading to the Fredonian War in 1826, which resulted in the expulsion of several prominent citizens. The Mexican government's laws and actions, including the prohibition of American immigration, further escalated tensions, ultimately leading to the Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832, where American settlers defeated the Mexican troops. The battle marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution and led to the expulsion of Mexican troops from the territory east of San Antonio. Following the battle, Nacogdoches became increasingly American in character, with Americans filling key offices and the town growing in numbers and influence."

The Mexican dictator Santa Anna's actions led to a \"war party\" emerging in Austin's colony, and eventually, East Texas was drawn into the conflict, with Nacogdoches playing a significant role in financing the Texas Revolution. After the revolution, Nacogdoches remained a prominent town, producing several notable leaders, including Sam Houston and General Thomas J. Rusk, and serving as a center of politics, commerce, and social life. However, as new towns and trade centers emerged, Nacogdoches' population and importance gradually declined, and it eventually settled into a more ordinary role as a flourishing town in the state. Despite this, Nacogdoches continued to be an important social and cultural center in East Texas."
