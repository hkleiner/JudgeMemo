        "section_summary": "In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets with writing were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, which dated back to around 1400 B.C., were part of the Egyptian state archives and were written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealing that the Semitic speech of Babylon was the language of diplomacy in the East at that time. The tablets consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch, providing valuable insights into the administration and diplomacy of the time. The discovery of the tablets shed light on the reigns of Pharaohs Amenophis III and IV, who belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty and introduced significant changes to the Egyptian court and administration. The tablets also revealed the complex system of writing and diplomacy used by the ancient Egyptians and their counterparts in Asia, with scribes using various scripts and languages to communicate."

He introduced a new doctrine, known as the Aten dogma, which emphasized the worship of the sun disk and was considered heretical. The king's efforts led to a break with the old religion, and he established a new capital, Akhet-Aten, which was consecrated before it was even finished. The Asiatic provinces, which were under Egyptian supremacy, enjoyed self-government but were plagued by internal conflicts, tribute issues, and the immigration of Bedawìn tribes, leading to a state of perpetual unrest. The Egyptian government struggled to maintain control, and despite being well-informed, they often took inadequate measures to address the problems, leading to further instability."

The Tell el Amarna letters, a collection of correspondence between Egyptian pharaohs and foreign rulers, provide valuable insights into the diplomatic relationships of the time. The letters from the Babylonian ruler Kadashman-Bel and the king of Mitani, Tushratta, reveal a complex web of alliances, gift-giving, and marriage negotiations, with the Egyptian king hesitant to give away his daughters in marriage. The letters also show a significant emphasis on the exchange of gifts, particularly gold, which was abundant in Egypt at the time. The correspondence between the Egyptian pharaoh and his foreign counterparts was characterized by elaborate introductions, declarations of affection, and stylized language, which were typical of the diplomatic conventions of the time."

The king of Mitani, Tushratta, formed an alliance with Egypt out of political necessity, rather than just for material gain. The Mitani kingdom eventually vanished, replaced by small Aramaic kingdoms, while Assyria seized its eastern boundary. The Egyptian XVIIIth Dynasty also faced a swift downfall, with the city of Tell el Amarna being razed to the ground after the death of King Napkhuria in 1370 B.C."
