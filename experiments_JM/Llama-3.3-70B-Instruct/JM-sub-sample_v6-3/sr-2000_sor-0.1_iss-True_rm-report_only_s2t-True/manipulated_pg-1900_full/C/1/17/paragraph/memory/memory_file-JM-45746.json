The author then visits a school and meets two individuals who represent different approaches to teaching: one who views it as a mere job and another who is passionate and dedicated to making it a profession. The latter individual has made efforts to improve the school environment and has found creative solutions to problems, such as adjusting the seating arrangement in a classroom to improve student behavior. In contrast, the author notes that some individuals, including a young woman applying for a teaching position, prioritize appearance over substance. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with a pleasing and forceful personality being a key factor."

The narrator believes that this experience illustrates the importance of treating staff as coworkers rather than subordinates. A survey of teachers revealed that they value assistance with exceptional children, interpretation of the course of study, and professional leadership from their principals. The principals can help teachers by providing support and resources, such as intelligence tests to classify pupils according to their ability, and by interpreting the course of study to ensure effective implementation."

To address this issue, schools are studying local industrial and commercial conditions and offering special subjects and courses to prepare students for various vocations. Some schools are also using club organizations and guest speakers to provide students with information about different professions and help them make informed decisions. By making these efforts, schools aim to give each student a chance to adjust to a vocation and succeed in life."
