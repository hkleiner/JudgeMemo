Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's talent was developed through independent and sustained effort, with a strong foundation in line-work and anatomy. She spent her days studying and drawing animals at a farm, and even learned sculpture to improve her art. Her hard work paid off when her paintings were accepted into the Salon, and she went on to receive critical acclaim and awards, including a first-class medal in 1848. Despite facing hostility from the jury, the public admired her unique and sincere style, which was inspired by her observations of animals.

Section section_03 (Chars 16915–25348):
Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur's success continued to grow, with her paintings selling profitably and gaining recognition from art collectors and dealers. Her friend and fellow artist, Mlle.

Rosa's passion for study and art led her to create masterpieces such as "Ploughing in the Nivernais" and "The Horse Fair", which brought her widespread acclaim and financial success. The "Horse Fair" painting, in particular, had a notable history, with multiple sales and reproductions, and ultimately found a home in the National Gallery.

Section section_05 (Chars 33658–42135):
Section Summary: In 18th century France, Choiseul worked to abolish the Jesuit Order, which was eventually dissolved and its property seized by the state. Meanwhile, artist Joshua Reynolds returned to England in 1752 and established a successful portrait painting studio, thanks to his talent and patronage. Rosa Bonheur, a renowned artist, was honored by the Emperor and later sent several works to the Universal Exposition of 1867, but received a lukewarm response from critics. She had previously run an art school for young girls, which achieved success under her guidance, and later retired to her residence at By, where she focused on her art and fulfilled numerous commissions. Rosa Bonheur's paintings gained immense popularity abroad, particularly in America, and she worked tirelessly to meet the demands of her purchasers, producing masterful works with impeccable finish.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur was a prolific artist during the 1860s and 1870s, creating notable works such as "Changing Pasture" and "The Cartload of Stones". The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 had a profound impact on her, and she refused to accept favors from the Prussian army, instead choosing to endure the hardships alongside her fellow French citizens. After the war, Bonheur created a series of paintings of wild beasts, showcasing her exceptional skill and attention to detail. Her personal life was marked by both joy and sorrow, including the loss of her dear friend Nathalie Micas in 1889, which led to a period of melancholy, but also the recognition of her artistic achievements, including being awarded the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour. Later in life, Bonheur found comfort in her friendship with a young American artist, Anna Klumpke, and continued to create art, including experimenting with pastel work.
