Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his instrument. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he recalls his own childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in the outdoors and music. Anthony's love for music was evident even as a young boy, where he would create makeshift instruments and hide a precious tuning fork outside the school window to evade the teacher's rules. The scene ends with Anthony playing his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony and richness, as he loses himself in the beauty of music."

He spent his days exploring nature, learning about the local flora and fauna, and teaching himself music by taking apart and reassembling instruments. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony developed remarkable skills, particularly in music, and was soon sought after to repair and restore instruments in the village. His passion for learning and music drove him to take on complex projects, including restoring a 70-year-old violin, which he worked on tirelessly to bring back to its former glory. Through his self-directed learning, Tony developed a unique set of skills and a deep love for music and nature."

As he entered his 17th year, Anthony's skills and knowledge continued to grow, and he was compared to the great Antonius Stradivarius. The school-teacher recognized Anthony's exceptional abilities and acknowledged that he couldn't teach him anything new, as Anthony's knowledge and understanding surpassed his own."
