To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a \"carnet rouge\" permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author eventually visited the battlefield of the Marne at Meaux, where she witnessed the graves of fallen soldiers and was struck by the somber scenery."

The narrator noted that many soldiers seemed to be loafing, waiting to be called to the front, and that the roads were surprisingly well-maintained despite the heavy traffic.

The author visited several hospitals in the war zone, including the Hôpital Central, and witnessed the dedication of the nurses and the impact of the supplementary supplies on the soldiers' well-being.

The author appeals to readers to donate to support the French soldiers and the relief efforts, emphasizing the importance of helping those in need."
