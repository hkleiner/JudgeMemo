        "section_summary": "In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of the site."

In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and began to convert the Saxons to Christianity, with Ethelbert himself being baptized and the city of Canterbury becoming a center of Christian worship. The church of St. Martin's is believed to be one of the oldest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain, and it is thought to have been built on the site of a Roman church. Canterbury suffered various attacks, including a devastating raid by the Danes in 1011, but was rebuilt and restored by subsequent rulers, including the Danish king Canute and the Norman archbishop Lanfranc. The city's cathedral has undergone several transformations over the centuries, with the current Norman-style building replacing the original Saxon church in 1070."

The cathedral, a masterpiece of Norman architecture, was the site of a significant event in history - the murder of Archbishop Becket, which occurred 40 years after its construction. Becket had returned to Canterbury after six years of exile and was received with great enthusiasm, but his reunion was short-lived as four knights, sent by King Henry II, arrived with the intention of killing him. The knights, after a tense and confrontational meeting with Becket, ultimately carried out their plan, murdering the Archbishop during Vespers. This event would go on to make Canterbury a famous resort for pilgrims in Europe."

Despite not being universally admired in his lifetime, Becket was quickly revered as a saint, and his murder led to a massive influx of pilgrims to Canterbury. King Henry II, who had been implicated in the murder, performed a public penance at the cathedral in 1174, which helped to absolve him of his guilt. The cathedral became a major pilgrimage site, with wealth pouring in and pilgrims taking away vials of \"martyr's blood\" mixed with water. The cathedral suffered a fire in 1174, but was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman, resulting in the beautiful and iconic structure that stands today."

The cathedral's central tower, commenced by Prior Molashe in 1433, is considered an external masterpiece. After reaching its peak, Canterbury began to decline, but its importance as a center of the English Church and its strategic location between England and France helped prevent it from decaying. The cathedral's architecture is a mix of Norman and Perpendicular styles, with various additions and modifications made over the centuries. The cathedral precincts include several notable features, such as the infirmary, treasury, and cloister, which showcase the monastery's history and architectural beauty."

The Trinity Chapel, once home to the shrine of St. Thomas, is now an empty space, but still evokes a sense of history and significance, with notable features including the tomb of the Black Prince and the mosaic pavement. The chapel is also the final resting place of Henry IV and his wife, Joan of Navarre, with their effigies believed to be faithful representations."

The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, have survived despite past threats of destruction and desecration. St. Augustine's Abbey, founded by Augustine in 613, was once a prominent Benedictine monastery and has since been restored and repurposed as a missionary college. The nearby church of St. Martin, where Queen Bertha once worshipped, is also a historic site, although its antiquity may not be immediately apparent to casual observers."

The Castle's Norman keep, completed in 1125, still stands, although it is currently used as a storage facility. The city is also home to several historic hospitals and religious houses, such as the Hospital of St. Nicholas, a former leper colony. The section concludes by noting that historical events are part of a continuous process, with no clear beginnings or ends, and that the past and future are always interconnected."
