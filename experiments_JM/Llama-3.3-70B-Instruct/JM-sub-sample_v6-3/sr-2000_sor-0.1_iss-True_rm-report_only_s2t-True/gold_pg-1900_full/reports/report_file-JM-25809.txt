Section Summary: Jim was deep in thought, reflecting on his past and considering seeking advice from Anne, when he was startled by a rattlesnake near the campsite where he and Ches were sleeping.

As they continued on their journey, Jim tried to gauge Ches' musical tastes, but the boy's preferences seemed to lean towards melancholic songs. The pair's journey was soon interrupted by the sighting of a mountain lion, which Ches excitedly pointed out to Jim, and the two prepared to defend themselves against the wild animal.
