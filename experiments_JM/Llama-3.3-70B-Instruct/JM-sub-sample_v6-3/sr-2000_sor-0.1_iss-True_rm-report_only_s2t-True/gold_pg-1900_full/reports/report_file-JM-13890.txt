Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the Anglo-Saxons invaded and rebuilt the city, renaming it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of the city.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–17132):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. In 597, Augustine arrived in Kent and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct the people, leading to the conversion of the king and many Saxons to Christianity. The old church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha had worshipped, was used by Augustine and his monks, and it is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact age is uncertain. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and it continues to be an important center of Christianity to this day. The city suffered a major setback in 1011 when it was attacked and sacked by the Danes, but it was later restored and continued to grow and prosper.

Section section_03 (Chars 17133–25886):
Section Summary: After the Norman Conquest, a fire destroyed the Saxon cathedral in Canterbury, and Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, rebuilt it in the Norman style. The new cathedral, completed in 1077, was later modified by Prior Ernulph, who constructed the magnificent Norman choir, which was consecrated in 1130. Forty years later, the cathedral became the site of the infamous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket, who had returned from exile just a few days prior. The murder was carried out by four knights who had been sent by King Henry II, and it led to Canterbury becoming a major pilgrimage site in Europe. The events surrounding Becket's murder were marked by a dramatic and tense confrontation between the archbishop and the four knights, which ultimately ended in tragedy.

Section section_04 (Chars 25887–34521):
Section Summary: Archbishop Thomas Becket's defiance towards the four knights who came to Canterbury ultimately led to his murder in the cathedral. The knights, fueled by fury, killed Becket with multiple sword strokes, and despite the sacrilege, they found it easy to escape due to the divided loyalties of the people of Canterbury. Becket's body was found to have a hair-cloth shirt and a black cowled cloak underneath his outer robes, revealing his austere and monastic lifestyle, which contributed to his rapid canonization as St. Thomas of Canterbury. The murder and subsequent discovery of Becket's ascetic practices sparked a wave of devotion, with people seeking relics of his body and clothing, believing they had miracle-working properties. King Henry, who had inadvertently caused Becket's death, later performed a severe penance at Canterbury Cathedral, which he believed led to a military victory and ultimately contributed to the city's reputation as a major pilgrimage site.

Section section_05 (Chars 34522–43355):
Section Summary: The city of Canterbury was flooded with pilgrims every year, with people coming from all over to visit the Cathedral and pay homage to Thomas Becket. A fire in 1174 damaged the Cathedral, and it was rebuilt by architects William of Sens and William the Englishman in the Transitional style, which combined Romanesque and Gothic elements. The Cathedral was further expanded and renovated over the centuries, with notable events including the translation of Becket's remains to a new shrine in 1220 and the rebuilding of the nave and transept in the Perpendicular style between 1378 and 1411. Despite the dissolution of the monasteries and the decline of the city, Canterbury remained an important center of the English Church and continued to attract visitors, including royal ones. The city's historic architecture and charming streets have been preserved, making it a unique and romantic destination for modern pilgrims.

Section section_06 (Chars 43356–51603):
Section Summary: The narrator enters the Cathedral precincts through the weather-worn gateway, Prior Goldstone II, and is immediately struck by the vast pile of the Cathedral. As they walk around the building, they take in the various architectural features, including the western towers, the nave, and the Angel Tower. The narrator notes that the monastic buildings, including the great hall and infirmary, are located on the north side of the Cathedral, and points out several notable features, such as the Transitional-Norman treasury and the beautiful Perpendicular cloister. The description then moves to the interior of the Cathedral, beginning at the south porch, which is a beautiful feature with a double row of canopied niches containing statues. The narrator is awestruck by the vast and ordered beauty of the Cathedral's nave, which is a magnificent vestibule to the rest of the building.

Section section_07 (Chars 51604–60071):
Section Summary: The Canterbury Cathedral, a vast and impressive building, remains as a testament to the endeavors of monastic life. The cathedral features various notable architectural elements, including the western screen, the Angel Steeple, and the Trinity Chapel, which was rebuilt by William of Sens and his English successor. The Trinity Chapel is particularly significant, as it was the site of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket, whose fame drew pilgrims from all over Europe. The chapel contains several notable tombs, including those of Henry IV and the Black Prince, as well as a series of 13th-century stained glass windows that depict the cures wrought at the shrine. The cathedral's architecture and historical significance continue to evoke a sense of awe and fascination, much like it did for the pilgrims of the Middle Ages.

Section section_08 (Chars 60072–68780):
Section Summary: The city of Canterbury still retains much of its historic charm, with its old walls and gates, despite some destruction over the centuries. The West Gate is the only remaining gate, and it was nearly demolished in 1850 to accommodate a circus procession, but was saved by the Mayor's casting vote. The city's historic buildings, including the Cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey, have undergone various transformations over the years, with some being used for debased purposes before being restored. The Abbey, founded by Augustine, was rescued in 1844 by Mr. Beresford Hope and is now a missionary college, incorporating some of the original structures. Canterbury still has many other treasures to offer, including the Castle, old inns, churches, and museums, showcasing its rich history and architecture.

Section section_09 (Chars 68780–69152):
Section Summary: The churches in the area are notable, but one that lacks interest is All Saints' in High Street. In contrast, St. Dunstan's is a church of interest. It houses the head of Sir Thomas More in a vault, although it is not possible to view it. Visitors can, however, see the picturesque brick gateway of the Roper house in St. Dunstan's Street. This gateway is a point of interest near St. Dunstan's church.
