In contrast, the author shares the stories of two young men who entered the teaching profession, one who treated it as a mere job and another who approached it as a profession, taking initiative and showing dedication to improving the school and its students. The author emphasizes the importance of a teacher's personality, preparation, and experience in achieving success, with personality being a key factor in inspiring and motivating students. The author reflects on their own experience of being influenced by a principal with an attractive personality, which inspired them to complete their high school education. Ultimately, the author highlights the difference between treating teaching as a job versus a profession, with the latter requiring passion, dedication, and a commitment to making a positive impact on students."

Before starting a new position, it's essential to prepare and get acquainted with the school situation, as the author did when they became a superintendent of a small town's schools. By doing so, they were able to create a smooth transition and make informed decisions about the school's programs and budget."

A successful superintendent should hold regular sectional meetings and general meetings, allowing teachers to discuss topics of their choice and receive constructive feedback. The author also highlights the value of personal talks between the superintendent and individual teachers to understand their challenges and suggestions. In a separate context, the author describes their experience with a school board meeting, where they presented a detailed report on the first day of school, which led to a standing invitation to attend all board meetings and an extension of their authority. This ultimately resulted in improved efficiency and cost savings in managing school supplies."

By striking a balance between academics and extracurricular activities, schools can provide a well-rounded education and foster a positive school community."

Overall, these activities are an important part of the school experience and can have a positive impact on students when managed effectively."

The teachers also valued principals who could provide constructive criticism, poise, and higher human qualities in their relationships. By working together and providing support, principals can help teachers be more effective and improve the overall school environment."

To address this, schools are implementing vocational guidance programs, trade schools, and part-time schools to prepare students for their future careers. Some schools are using club organizations and guest speakers to provide students with information about different professions and help them make informed decisions. Many parents and community members are unaware of the resources and opportunities available in schools, leading to misconceptions about the value of education. By working together, schools can help students adjust to a vocation and prepare them for success in life."
