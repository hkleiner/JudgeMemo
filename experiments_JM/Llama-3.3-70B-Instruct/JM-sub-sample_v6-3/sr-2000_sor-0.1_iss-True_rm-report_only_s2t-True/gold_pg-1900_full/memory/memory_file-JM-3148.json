Anthony is a skilled violinist who believes that the secret to everything beautiful and true is hidden in the strings of his instrument. As Davy reads, Anthony's mind wanders, and he recalls his own childhood, where he struggled in school and found solace in the outdoors and music. Anthony's love for music was evident even as a young boy, where he would create makeshift instruments and treasure a tuning fork given to him by a singing teacher. The scene ends with Anthony playing his violin, filling the atmosphere with harmony and beauty."

However, he was actually a self-motivated learner who spent most of his time exploring the woods, observing nature, and teaching himself various skills. He had a passion for music and spent hours taking apart and repairing musical instruments, eventually becoming skilled enough to fix complex instruments like violins. Despite his unconventional approach to learning, Tony was a good son, affectionate and obedient, and his mother tolerated his eccentricities. As he grew older, Tony's skills and knowledge continued to expand, and he developed a deep understanding of the world around him, driven by his insatiable curiosity and love for learning."

She was now 40 years old, but still felt young and sensitive, with a deep emotional life. As she settled into her new home, Lyddy had few visitors, and the community was still getting used to the fact that she was living in the cottage, which had previously been her aunt's home."
