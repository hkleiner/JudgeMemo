        "section_summary": "Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, often compared to Dutch masters such as Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, reflecting his own gentle disposition and study of Italian Renaissance masters like Andrea Mantegna. His paintings, such as \"The Angelus,\" capture the struggles and simple faith of rural life, and are not sentimental but rather infused with intense earnestness and melancholy truth. Millet's unique style, shaped by his experiences living among peasants, is marked by subtlety and restraint, rather than showy technique. As a painter, Millet's strength lies in his ability to convey a profound message, rather than in flashy brushwork or technical pyrotechnics."

His paintings, such as \"The Sheep Pen\" and \"The Sower\", showcased the loneliness and monotony of a peasant's labor, but also highlighted the importance of their work. Millet's art was not about technical skill or virtuosity, but about conveying a message and telling a story. He was inspired by the everyday life of peasants and the changing seasons, particularly spring, which symbolized new life and renewal. Overall, Millet's art was a reflection of his philosophical observations on life, and his brush was a means to an end, used to illustrate his thoughts and ideas."

        "section_summary": "In 19th century France, the art world was dominated by classical traditions, but a small group of artists, including Jean-François Millet, sought to create a new, naturalistic style. Millet was born in Gruchy, a small village in Normandy, where he grew up in a peasant family and was influenced by the rugged and picturesque landscape. His childhood was marked by simplicity, hard work, and a strong sense of family, with his grandmother and father playing important roles in shaping his values and interests. As he grew older, Millet developed a passion for drawing and literature, and his family encouraged him to pursue his artistic talents. He eventually left his rural home to migrate to Paris, where he would continue to develop his unique style and become a leading figure in the modern naturalistic school."

After his father's death, Millet returned to his family's farm, but his grandmother encouraged him to pursue art, and he eventually returned to Cherbourg to study with M. Langlois. With Langlois' help, Millet received a small pension to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the works of many masters, including Mantegna, Michelangelo, and Nicolas Poussin, who greatly influenced his style. Millet briefly studied with Delaroche, but found his academic approach stifling and eventually stopped attending his studio due to neglect and financial difficulties. Freed from these constraints, Millet was now able to develop his own unique style and work towards establishing himself as an artist."

He eventually moved to Barbizon, where he found inspiration in the peasant life and was able to focus on his true artistic passions. Millet's art was shaped by his own experiences as a peasant and his connection to the natural world, which differed from his friend Théodore Rousseau's focus on landscapes and solitude. Despite facing many challenges, including poverty and criticism, Millet continued to produce remarkable works, such as \"The Winnower,\" and eventually gained recognition. In Barbizon, Millet found a sense of community and inspiration that allowed him to develop his unique artistic style and voice."

However, his health began to decline due to a persistent cough, and he eventually passed away on January 20, 1875. Millet's art is characterized by his passionate sympathy with the common people, particularly peasants, and his ability to convey the struggles and hardships of their daily lives. His work had a profound influence on other artists, including Segantini, and continues to be celebrated for its sincerity and emotional depth. Millet's legacy is that of a poet, philosopher, and great thinker who used his art to express the human condition, often with a sense of melancholy and social commentary."
