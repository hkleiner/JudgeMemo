The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers have a legend that their forefathers came from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and they have retained their language and some of their customs. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique culture and language, which resembles Khirgis and Turkish, but they have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history or legends with the expedition team."

The Sarö Yögurs are a pastoral people, relying on herding cattle for their livelihood, and their diet consists mainly of flour, cereals, and tea made with salt and butter. They appear to be in straitened circumstances, with limited economic resources and a lack of energy and enthusiasm, particularly among the young men.

        "section_summary": "The author bid farewell to their hosts, the Shera Yögurs, on January 2nd, and began their journey through the valleys of Kluadjek-gol and Mör-gol. As they rode, the landscape shifted from steep grassy slopes to a wider valley with a river, eventually leading them to the Lansor's or Neiman-gol valley. The author followed the river and arrived at the Chinese town of Li-yen, also known as \"the garden of peartrees\", which was surrounded by picturesque hills and willow trees. The author was warmly received by the friendly old mandarin, who showed them great courtesy and hospitality, including a delicious dinner and a promise of sable skins on their next visit. The author continued their journey the next day, riding to Kanchenp'u and then back to Kanchow."
