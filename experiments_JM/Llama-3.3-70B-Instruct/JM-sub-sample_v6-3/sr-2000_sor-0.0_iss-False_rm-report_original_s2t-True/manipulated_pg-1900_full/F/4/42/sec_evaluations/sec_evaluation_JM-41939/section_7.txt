Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the artist would enjoyed" should be "the artist would have enjoyed"
* [LEXICON] "prostrated her suddenly" could be rephrased for better clarity
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the artist's painting to her death
* [TRANSITION] The connection between the artist's refusal of the medal and her subsequent death could be smoother
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
