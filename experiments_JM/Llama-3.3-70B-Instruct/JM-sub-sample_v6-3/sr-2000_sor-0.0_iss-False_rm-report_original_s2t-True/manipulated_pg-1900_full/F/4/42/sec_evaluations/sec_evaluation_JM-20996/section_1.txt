Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "No traveler who lands at Honolulu will felt unrequited" should be "No traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited"
* [GRAMMAR] "the lady owners chewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire" is an awkward phrase
* [GRAMMAR] "heads of hair that almost any lady woulded be proud to own" should be "heads of hair that almost any lady would be proud to own"
* [SPELLING] "wonted" is an uncommon word, but correctly used
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from describing the departure from San Francisco to a detailed description of Honolulu
* [TRANSITION] The transition between the description of the Bishop Museum and the sport of surf-shooting is not smooth
* [LOGIC] The inclusion of the story about Napoleon and the "Revels of Neptune" seems unrelated to the rest of the narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
