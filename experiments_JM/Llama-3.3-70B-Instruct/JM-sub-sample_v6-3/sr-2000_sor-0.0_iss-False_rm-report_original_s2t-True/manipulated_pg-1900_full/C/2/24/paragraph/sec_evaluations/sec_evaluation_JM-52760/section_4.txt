Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] sudden, unexplained phrases like "A notification chimed twice" and "A tablet lit up on the table" and "A smart bulb changed color" disrupt the flow
- [LEXICON] some sentences are wordy or use less common vocabulary, which may hinder smooth reading for some audiences
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the inclusion of unrelated phrases about a notification, tablet, and smart bulb seems illogical and disrupts the narrative
- [STRUCTURE] the text jumps abruptly between describing the tunnel's construction, the battle plan, and the battle itself, which can be disorienting
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
