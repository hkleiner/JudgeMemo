Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "who after our walk had been upstairs to changed something" should be "to change something"
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
* [LEXICON] Use of less common vocabulary, such as "panegyric" and "unmodulated", may cause difficulty for some readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from the scene with Lady Jane to the dinner table
* [STRUCTURE] The story is told through a non-linear narrative, which can be confusing at times
* [CLARITY] Some parts of the dialogue are unclear or open to interpretation
