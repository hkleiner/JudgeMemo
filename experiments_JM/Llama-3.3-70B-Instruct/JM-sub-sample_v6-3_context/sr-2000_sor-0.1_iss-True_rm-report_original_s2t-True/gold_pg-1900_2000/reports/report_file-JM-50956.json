Section section_01 (Chars 0–8726):
Section Summary: Russia played a crucial role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, diverting enemy forces and giving the Allies time to prepare and counterattack. Russia's efforts weakened the enemy's resources, making it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat Germany. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Russia's sacrifices and contributions to the war effort were instrumental in the Allied victory, and its role should not be underestimated.

Section section_02 (Chars 8726–13144):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, relied on concentrating all forces against France, but this was thwarted when Russia launched a surprise attack on East Prussia, diverting German troops. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and gave France a crucial advantage, ultimately leading to the German defeat on the Marne. Russia's early efforts played a significant role in the war, as they bore the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's contributions are often overlooked due to the circumstances that developed towards the end of the war. German General Ludendorf's memoirs have also contributed to this oversight, as they contain false and misleading information that slanders the Russian Army and distorts the historic perspective of the war.
