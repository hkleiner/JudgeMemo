Section section_01 (Chars 0–8256):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on their way to the Battersea Home for Lost Dogs to adopt a dog, having decided against buying a purebred dog with a pedigree. They take a tram to Battersea and, upon arrival, try to find the dog home without asking for directions, but their attempts at navigation are unsuccessful. A street boy they consider asking for help instead plays a prank on them, and they continue on their way, eventually spotting an official from the dog home and deciding to follow him discreetly. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and embarrassing, with frequent near-collisions and awkward pauses. The official eventually ducks into a public house, leaving the couple to decide whether to follow him inside.

Section section_02 (Chars 8257–12617):
Section Summary: Stella and the narrator followed a man they believed was going to the Dogs' Home, but he led them on a wild goose chase through the streets. The man eventually escaped into his home, leaving the couple exhausted and discomfited. After their failed adventure, they returned home by train and walked across the golf course, with Stella still shaken by the experience. The narrator suggests advertising for a dog, but Stella is opposed to the idea, still reeling from their earlier escapade. As they walk, Stella suddenly grabs the narrator's arm, pointing out something that has caught her attention near a small pond on the golf course.
