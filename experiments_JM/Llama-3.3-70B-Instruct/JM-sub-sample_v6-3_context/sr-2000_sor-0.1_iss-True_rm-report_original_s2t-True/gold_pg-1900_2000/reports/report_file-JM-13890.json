Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear before him, and when he didn't, his shrine was destroyed and his name was erased from records. However, this didn't mark the end of pilgrimages to Canterbury, as a new wave of enthusiasm for the site emerged in the 20th century. Many modern pilgrims take the train to Canterbury, but those who walk the old Pilgrims' Way from Winchester are rewarded with a gradual unfolding of the city's story and a richer experience. The city of Canterbury has a long history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, which they called Durovernum, and later the Anglo-Saxons rebuilding the town and renaming it Cantwarabyrig. The city's strategic location at the junction of several Roman roads made it an important center, and it eventually became the capital of Kent under the reign of Ethelbert in 561.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–12766):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. Prior to 597, Canterbury was a heathen city, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard, who had introduced Christianity. In 597, Augustine arrived and was allowed to preach and instruct the people, leading to many conversions, including Ethelbert's own baptism. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years, and remains a significant ecclesiastical center to this day. The city's St. Martin's church, where Augustine and his monks began to preach, is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact origins and age are still a matter of debate among historians and archaeologists.
