Section section_01 (Chars 0–7792):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a picturesque region surrounded by olive trees and colorful flowers, Fragonard developed a love for beauty and art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the influence of Madame de Pompadour, who was a patron of the arts and a supporter of artists like François Boucher. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a career in painting. Eventually, his talent and dedication earned him the opportunity to follow his dreams and become a renowned artist.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–12969):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old Fragonard and his mother traveled to Paris to meet the renowned painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, impressed by Fragonard's potential, advised him to train with Chardin to master his craft, but Fragonard made little progress and was eventually sent away. Undeterred, Fragonard continued to develop his skills by studying and painting masterpieces in Parisian churches, and after six months, he returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a student. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard honed his skills and eventually won the prestigious Prix de Rome at the age of 20. He then went on to study at the king's school and continued to work in Boucher's studio, producing notable works such as "Blind Man's Buff".
