Section section_01 (Chars 0–8149):
Section Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his parents, and they decide to try to find its owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he hopes to train it to be a sheep-dog. The family's excitement about the puppy is soon overshadowed by the news that they will be visiting Donald's uncle, Alan, next month for a birthday party, which promises to be a fun and exciting adventure.
