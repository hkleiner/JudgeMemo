Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature directly, even if it meant going to great lengths to do so. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier grew up in a time when French art was dominated by classicism, but he would later develop his own unique style. His interest in art began at a young age, and despite his father's initial disapproval, he pursued his passion, eventually becoming a skilled painter. Meissonier's early life was marked by a "hard struggle," but he eventually found success and made a name for himself in the art world. His approach to art was characterized by a "devout and inflexible respect for reality," which guided his work and set him apart from other artists of his time.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–12899):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. During his time at Cogniet's studio, Meissonier developed his skills by drawing soldiers and horses in uniform, which sparked his interest in depicting the Napoleonic Era. Despite struggling financially, Meissonier shared his poverty with friends, including Daumier and Daubigny, and found ways to make a living, including decorating fans and creating illustrations for publishers. At the age of 16, Meissonier exhibited his first work, "A Visit to the Burgomaster," but it went largely unnoticed by the public. He eventually gained recognition from editors and publishers, including Curmer, after persistently offering his illustrations, which marked the beginning of his successful career.
