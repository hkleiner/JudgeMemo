Section section_01 (Chars 0–7779):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is sitting on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated with his lack of success in finding gold. He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation, and he is deeply hurt by her words. Despite his feelings, Jim is interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who tries to cheer him up and suggests he take a break and go to town to have some fun. However, Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and also because he is "busted" and doesn't want to accumulate more debt. Jim's situation is one of emotional and financial struggle, as he tries to come to terms with his failed prospects and his unrequited love.

Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him from a nearby herd. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim prepares to ride. Before they part ways, Bud tells Jim about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but only got $10 and a warning from Bud.
