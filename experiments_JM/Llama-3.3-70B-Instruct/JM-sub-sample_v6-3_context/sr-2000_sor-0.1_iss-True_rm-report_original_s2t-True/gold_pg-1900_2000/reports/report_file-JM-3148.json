Section Summary: The story begins with a boy named Davy reading to his uncle, Anthony Croft, who is blind.

Anthony's love for music started at a young age, and he would often create makeshift instruments in school, despite the disapproval of his teachers.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–11543):
Section Summary: The teacher in Edgewood often struggled to keep her students engaged, especially on hot afternoons, and Anthony, a curious and restless boy, would sometimes sneak out of the window to snap a tuning fork. Despite being considered the laziest boy in the village, Anthony was actually driven by a desire to learn and understand the world around him, constantly asking "why" and "how" about the natural world. He spent much of his time exploring the woods, teaching himself about the natural world, and discovering hidden wonders like rare flowers and birds. Anthony's mother acknowledged that he had a wealth of "useless information" about the natural world, but saw it as a quirk rather than a strength. Through his self-directed learning, Anthony developed a deep connection with nature and a sense of wonder that drove his curiosity and love of learning.
