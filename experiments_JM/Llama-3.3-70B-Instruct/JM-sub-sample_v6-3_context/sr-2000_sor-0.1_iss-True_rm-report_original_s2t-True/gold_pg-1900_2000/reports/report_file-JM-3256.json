Section section_01 (Chars 0–8144):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point with two anecdotes: one about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase but doesn't truly appreciate the books, and another about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognizes the value of classic literature. The author argues that a bookman can enjoy a wide range of reading materials, from classics to detective stories, as long as they can distinguish between books of lasting value and those that are fleeting. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, discerning reader who can appreciate true literary merit over the flashy, trendy reader who follows the latest literary fads.

Section section_02 (Chars 8144–11574):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact. A true classic, according to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, is a book that enriches the human mind, speaks to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcends the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author, a self-proclaimed bookman, values these classic works and seeks to distinguish them from more ordinary books that may be entertaining but lack lasting significance. The subject matter of a book is secondary to its literary quality, and a true book lover can appreciate works from diverse perspectives and styles.
