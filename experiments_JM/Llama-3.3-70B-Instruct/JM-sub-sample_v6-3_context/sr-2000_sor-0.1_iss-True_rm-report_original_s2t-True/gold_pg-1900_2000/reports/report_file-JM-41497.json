Section section_02 (Chars 8751–12246):
Section Summary: Sir Joshua Reynolds quickly gained success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. As his career progressed, he moved to larger studios, raised his prices, and socialized with influential people, including Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Reynolds was a man of many dimensions, and his friendships with intelligent and accomplished individuals helped shape his mind and character. Despite his accomplishments, he had his flaws, including snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which were somewhat refined through his associations with distinguished people. Overall, Reynolds was a complex figure, and it is interesting to see him as a real person with both merits and faults, rather than an idealized version.
