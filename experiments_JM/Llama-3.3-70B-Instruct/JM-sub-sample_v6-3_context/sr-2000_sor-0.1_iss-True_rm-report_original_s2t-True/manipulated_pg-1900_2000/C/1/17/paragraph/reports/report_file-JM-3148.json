Section section_02 (Chars 7940–12509):
Section Summary: As a young boy, Tony Croft was constantly fascinated by music and learning, often finding ways to create makeshift instruments and sneak in moments of play during school. Despite being labeled as the laziest boy in the village, Tony was actually driven by a curiosity and passion for discovery, always asking "why" and seeking to understand the world around him. He spent much of his free time exploring the woods, where he educated himself and gained a deep knowledge of nature, including the locations of rare flowers and the songs of wild birds. Tony's mother acknowledged that he had a wealth of "useless information," but it was clear that his self-directed learning was driven by a genuine love of discovery. Through his independent explorations, Tony developed a unique and intimate connection with the natural world.
