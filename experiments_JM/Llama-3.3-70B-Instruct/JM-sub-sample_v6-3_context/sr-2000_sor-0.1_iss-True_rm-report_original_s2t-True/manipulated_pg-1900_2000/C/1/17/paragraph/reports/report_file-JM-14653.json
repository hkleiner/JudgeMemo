Section section_01 (Chars 0–8463):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, noting that the excitement and anticipation of the holiday season have diminished. In the past, Christmas was a time of genuine joy and celebration, but now it feels forced and artificial, with people having to deliberately induce the "Christmas feeling". The author suggests that this decline is not just a result of growing older, but a broader cultural shift, and points to the fact that children still exhibit genuine enthusiasm for Christmas as evidence that the holiday was once more deeply felt by adults. The old Christmas hymns, with their "fiery lyrical splendour", are also cited as proof of the holiday's former significance. Overall, the author laments the loss of Christmas's original magic and meaning.

Section section_02 (Chars 8463–12104):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who prioritized truth and skepticism over faith and tradition. Their discoveries and ideas led to an age of doubt, causing people to question and eventually dismiss long-held beliefs, including the literal interpretation of the Nativity story. As a result, faith and sentimentality have become undervalued, leaving people feeling unfulfilled and searching for something to believe in. Despite this, people still try to keep the Christmas spirit alive, suggesting that a deep-seated instinct reminds them of its importance. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit remains, even if its traditional foundations have been shaken, and people continue to seek a sense of meaning and connection to it.
