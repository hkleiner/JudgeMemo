Section Summary: Raymond Bonheur, a talented but impoverished painter, married Sophie Marquis and they had several children, including Rosalie, known as Rosa Bonheur. The family faced financial struggles and moved to Paris in 1829, where Rosa was raised with her brothers and developed boyish manners. After her mother's death in 1833, Rosa's father encouraged her to pursue art, and she began sketching in his studio, producing her first painting, a still life of cherries. With her father's mild encouragement, Rosa became determined to become an artist, and she started copying the works of great masters at the Louvre. Rosa's early life and upbringing laid the foundation for her future success as a renowned artist.

Section Summary: Rosa Bonheur, a young artist, spent her days studying and sketching at the Louvre and in her father's studio, driven by her passion for art and her desire to improve.

As she grew in skill and confidence, Rosa began to send her paintings to the Salon, where they were initially met with little notice, but eventually gained recognition from critics for their sincerity and vigor. Her hard work and dedication paid off, and she became known for her ability to capture the beauty and movement of animals in her art.
