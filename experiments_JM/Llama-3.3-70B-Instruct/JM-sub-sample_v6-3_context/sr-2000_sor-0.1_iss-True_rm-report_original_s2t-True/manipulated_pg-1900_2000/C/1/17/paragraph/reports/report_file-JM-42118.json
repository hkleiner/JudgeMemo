Section section_01 (Chars 0–7637):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. The town of Grasse was a quiet and isolated place, far removed from the politics and fashions of Paris. As a young boy, Fragonard was aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour as the king's mistress. However, his life took a dramatic turn when his father apprenticed him to a notary, a profession that did not suit Fragonard's artistic inclinations. Eventually, his notary master recognized Fragonard's passion for art and advised that he be allowed to pursue his creative interests.

Section section_02 (Chars 7637–12637):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to pursue a career in art. She introduced him to the renowned painter Boucher, who eventually took him under his wing after initial rejections from other artists, including Chardin. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's skills improved significantly, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." Fragonard then attended the king's school and continued to work in Boucher's studio, producing notable works such as "Blind Man's Buff." During this time, he also came under the patronage of the Marquis de Marigny, the brother of the influential Madame Pompadour.
