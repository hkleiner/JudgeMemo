Section section_02 (Chars 8104–13118):
Section Summary: Jim is feeling unwell and disillusioned with everything, but his friend Bud tries to cheer him up by suggesting he go to town, get drunk, and have a good time. However, Jim declines, citing that he is "busted" and instead asks Bud to help him get a burro from a nearby herd. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim prepares to ride, tying a gunny sack to the animal. Before they part ways, Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but was only given $10 and warned not to bother Bud again. Jim and his burro then set off together, with Jim trying to thank Bud for his help.
