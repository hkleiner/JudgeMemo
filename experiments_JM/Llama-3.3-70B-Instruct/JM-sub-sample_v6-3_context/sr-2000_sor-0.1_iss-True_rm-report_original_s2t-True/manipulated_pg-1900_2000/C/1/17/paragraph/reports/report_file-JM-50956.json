Section section_01 (Chars 0–8668):
Section Summary: Russia played a crucial role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and efforts were instrumental in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan to quickly defeat France was thwarted by Russia's intervention. The author argues that Russia's role in the war should be gauged not only by its losses but also by its efforts to disrupt German plans and save critical situations, which ultimately enabled the Allies to deliver the final blow. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was a significant factor in the Allied victory, and its sacrifices should not be overlooked.

Section section_02 (Chars 8669–13603):
Section Summary: France was at a significant disadvantage at the start of the war, outnumbered and facing a powerful enemy. However, the Russian Army's early sacrifices played a crucial role in preventing Germany from achieving a quick victory, particularly during the Battle of the Marne. Despite being unprepared, Russia's efforts during the first few years of the war were instrumental in fighting the Central Powers, alongside France. The significance of Russia's contributions is often overlooked, and some, like General Ludendorf, have attempted to discredit the Russian Army's efforts. Russia's role in the war was vital, and its sacrifices should be recognized as a key factor in the ultimate Allied victory.
