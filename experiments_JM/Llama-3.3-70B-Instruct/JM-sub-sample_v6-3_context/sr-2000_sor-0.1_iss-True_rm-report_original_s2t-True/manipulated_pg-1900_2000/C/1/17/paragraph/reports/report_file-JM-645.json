Section section_01 (Chars 0–7912):
Section Summary: The narrator's career is boosted when his friend George Corvick asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for "The Middle" magazine. Corvick is unable to write the review himself due to a personal emergency and entrusts the narrator with the task, urging him to truly understand Vereker's work. The narrator spends a night reading the novel and writes a review, but later worries that it may not have done justice to Vereker's writing. He meets Vereker at a social gathering and is tempted to discuss his review with him, but the opportunity is missed. Lady Jane eventually comes to the narrator's aid, praising his review and bringing it to Vereker's attention, potentially saving the narrator from embarrassment.

Section section_02 (Chars 7912–11661):
Section Summary: Lady Jane showed a man a review of an author's work, enthusiastically pointing out the highlighted passages. The author of the review was present and eventually revealed himself, but Lady Jane's excitement seemed to diminish upon learning his identity. At dinner, the author waited for the subject to be brought up, and when it was, he was shocked to hear the author being discussed, Vereker, dismiss the review as "twaddle". Vereker's response was unexpected and suggested he didn't think highly of the review. The conversation was interrupted, but Vereker hinted that the author of the review had missed the point of his work, saying "the author doesn't see anything".
