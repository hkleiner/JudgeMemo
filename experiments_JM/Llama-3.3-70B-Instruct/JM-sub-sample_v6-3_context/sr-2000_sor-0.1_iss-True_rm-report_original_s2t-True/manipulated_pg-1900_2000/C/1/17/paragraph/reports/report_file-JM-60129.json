Section section_01 (Chars 0–8408):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a barren landscape and eventually arrived at the village of Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people, also known as the "yellow Yögurs". The villagers were initially hesitant to interact with the expedition, but eventually warmed up and shared some information about their history and culture. The Sarö Yögurs have a distinct language and customs, and are scattered across several villages in the region, with some speaking a language similar to Turkish and others speaking a language similar to Mongolian. The team settled into the village temple, where they were able to rest and begin their work, despite the initial cool reception from the lamas.

Section section_02 (Chars 8408–13654):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people's homes feature traditional Chinese elements, such as the k'ang sleeping stove and Buddhist altars, with some Mongolian influences. Their clothing is mostly made from home-spun materials and cut in Chinese fashion, with men wearing long coats and women wearing similar dresses with distinctive headpieces adorned with coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The women are responsible for weaving, while men engage in basket-making and knitting stockings using primitive methods. The Sarö Yögur people have limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items. Their daily life involves men staying at home, while women tend to outdoor tasks such as cattle herding and water carrying.
