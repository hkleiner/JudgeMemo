Section section_01 (Chars 0–8112):
Section Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy, which he hopes to keep as his own. Donald's father, Doctor Gordon, agrees that they can give the puppy a good home if no one claims it. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, complete with shortbread, scones, and other sweet treats, and discusses plans to visit Uncle Alan's farm, where Donald hopes to learn about training the puppy as a sheep-dog. The visit to Uncle Alan's farm is also an opportunity to celebrate a family birthday and spend time together, which the boys are eagerly looking forward to.
