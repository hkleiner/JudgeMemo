Section section_02 (Chars 8839–13972):
Section Summary: The writings of Bahá’u’lláh have been translated and published in over 800 languages, making them accessible to people worldwide. In contrast, the section also discusses the life and work of Sir Joshua Reynolds, an English painter who was inspired by the company of notable thinkers, but also struggled with personal weaknesses such as jealousy and vulgarity. The text then shifts to describe the work of Jean-François Millet, a painter who was more of a philosopher, capturing the struggles and simplicity of peasant life in his art. Millet's paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen", convey the loneliness and hardship of rural labor, where the beauty of nature is overshadowed by the daily struggles of survival. Through his art, Millet reveals a deep understanding of the human condition and the everyday lives of ordinary people.
