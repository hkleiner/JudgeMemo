Section Summary: The section begins with a mention of a claim that sparked violent hostility from Muslim clergy, but then shifts to a personal narrative about a young boy's life. The boy, who is around 12 years old, starts working at the Iron Agitator newspaper office, washing and feeding the press, and eventually becomes a job printer. He learns the trade and takes on more responsibilities, earning a higher wage, and even gets offered a job at a rival newspaper, the Peninsula Record. As he grows older, he becomes an integral part of the Iron Ore print shop, earning a man's wages by the time he is 15. The section ends with a scene describing the editor, Mr. Newett, working late on a Friday night, while a faker is selling soap outside, using a deceptive sales tactic.
