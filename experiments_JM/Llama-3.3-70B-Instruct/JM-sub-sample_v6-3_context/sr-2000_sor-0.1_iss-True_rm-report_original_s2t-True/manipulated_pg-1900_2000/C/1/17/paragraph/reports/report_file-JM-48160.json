=== Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8205):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front, attempts to obtain permission through various influential people, including a duchess who helps her meet with a high-ranking official. After explaining her mission to publicize the work of "Le Bienêtre du Blessé", an organization that provides aid to convalescent soldiers, she is granted a "carnet rouge" allowing her to visit certain base hospitals. However, her request to visit Amiens, which is close to the front lines, is denied due to the ongoing Battle of the Somme. The author is instead offered permission to visit other locations, including Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, with the possibility of visiting other areas in the future.
