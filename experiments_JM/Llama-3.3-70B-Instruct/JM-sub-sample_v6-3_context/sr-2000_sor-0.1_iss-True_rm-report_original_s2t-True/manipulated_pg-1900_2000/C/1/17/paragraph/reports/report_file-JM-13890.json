Section section_01 (Chars 0–8587):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. The chapter also touches on the artistic influences of various painters, including Reynolds, who was able to absorb and apply the techniques of other artists to his own work. The story of Canterbury begins with the Roman invasions of Britain and the description of the people of Kent by Julius Caesar. The Romans established a settlement in Canterbury, known as Durovernum, which became an important center with five major roads converging on the site. The city's history is evident in its architecture, with Roman materials and remains still visible beneath the present surface.

Section section_02 (Chars 8588–12819):
Section Summary: The section begins by mentioning the Universal House of Justice and the confidence of Bahá'ís in the future of the planet, but then shifts to a historical account of the Christianization of England. In 597, Augustine landed in England and began to preach and instruct the locals, with the support of King Ethelbert, who eventually converted to Christianity. The city of Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The church of St. Martin's, where Queen Bertha and her chaplain worshipped, is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact origins are disputed among archaeologists and antiquaries. The church's history and significance are still celebrated, and it remains an important part of England's ecclesiastical heritage.
