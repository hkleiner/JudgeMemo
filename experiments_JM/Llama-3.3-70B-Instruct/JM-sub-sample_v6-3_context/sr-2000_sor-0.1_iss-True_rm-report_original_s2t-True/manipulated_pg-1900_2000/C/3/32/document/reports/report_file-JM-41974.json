Section section_01 (Chars 0–8275):
Section Summary: Veronese, considered one of the greatest painters, was known for his absurd yet adorable style, which disregarded logic and historical truth in favor of vibrant colors and fantasy. Born Paolo Caliari in Verona in 1528, he came from a family of artists and was trained in painting by his uncle and other local artists. Veronese's early work showed promise, and he quickly gained recognition, including a commission from Cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga to paint a picture for the cathedral at Mantua. He outshone his competitors and gained preference, but soon found that his native city was too limited for his ambitions, leading him to leave Verona with his friend Zelotti to seek new opportunities. Veronese's love for Venice, where he later settled, would become a defining feature of his work, as he glorified the city through his magnificent use of color and expression.
