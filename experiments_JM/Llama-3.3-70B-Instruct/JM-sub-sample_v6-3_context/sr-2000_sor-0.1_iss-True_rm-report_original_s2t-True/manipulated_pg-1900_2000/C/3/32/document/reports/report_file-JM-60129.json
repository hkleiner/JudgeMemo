Section section_01 (Chars 0–8346):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers, also known as Huang Fantzu or "yellow barbarians," have a legend that their forefathers came from a city in the west over a thousand years ago. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique language, similar to Khirgis and Turkish, but have no written language and were unwilling to share their early history, songs, or legends with the expedition team.

Section section_02 (Chars 8346–12737):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people's homes feature traditional Chinese and Mongolian elements, including a sleeping stove, Buddhist altar, and Chinese kettles. Their clothing is primarily made from home-spun materials and is cut in Chinese fashion, with men and women wearing similar attire, including long coats, trousers, and fur coats. The women's head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, coral, glass beads, and copper rings. The Yögur people have limited handicrafts and home industries, with women weaving cloth and men engaging in basket-making and knitting stockings using primitive techniques. Overall, the Yögur people have a simple and traditional way of life, with limited access to new goods and a reliance on homemade and second-hand items.
