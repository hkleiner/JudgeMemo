Section section_02 (Chars 7758–12929):
Section Summary: In 1750, the year of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, a 16-year-old boy's mother took him to Paris to meet the famous painter Boucher, hoping to secure an apprenticeship for her son. Boucher, although impressed by the boy's potential, felt he lacked the necessary skills and advised the mother to take him to Chardin, a master of still-life painting, to learn the basics of his craft. However, the boy, later known as Fragonard, made little progress under Chardin and was eventually sent away. He then returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a student, providing him with ideal training by working on large decorative cartoons. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's skills improved, and he eventually won the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols".
