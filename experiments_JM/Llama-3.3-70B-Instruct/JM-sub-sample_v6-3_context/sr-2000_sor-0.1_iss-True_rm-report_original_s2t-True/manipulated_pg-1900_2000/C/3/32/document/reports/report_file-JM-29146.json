Section section_01 (Chars 0–8003):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government's move is seen as a power play to control the flow of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ship construction, and to charge higher prices for it. Ramsey, now stranded on Irwadi, is left to find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene. He has some savings to tide him over, but his future as a pilot is uncertain.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16069):
Section Summary: The Irwadi Security Officer, Chind Ramar, has ordered the crew and passengers of the ship Polaris to assemble, announcing that the planet has been "planetarized" and all outworld ships are stranded indefinitely. This means that only Irwadian pilots will be allowed to transport the vital metal titanium, which is abundant on the planet, to the rest of the galaxy. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is among those affected and has surrendered his pilot license, but he is confident that he can survive until the Interstellar Transfer Service comes to the rescue. Meanwhile, an Earthgirl who can read minds has also left the ship and is heading to the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, trying to avoid panic. Ramsey and his fellow pilot, Stu Englander, are now facing financial difficulties and uncertainty about their future on the hostile planet.

Section section_03 (Chars 16070–21965):
Section Summary: Jase Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to make ends meet, and gives him 375 credits to support his family. Englander is grateful, but Ramsey tells him not to worry about paying him back. Ramsey then heads to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is left with only three credits. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, wearing flashy jewelry and naked except for his accessories, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a troublemaking outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent.
