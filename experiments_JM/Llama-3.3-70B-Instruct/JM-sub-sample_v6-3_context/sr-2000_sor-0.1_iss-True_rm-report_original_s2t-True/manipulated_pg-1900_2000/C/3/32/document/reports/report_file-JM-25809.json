Despite his feelings, Jim is interrupted by the arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, who tries to cheer him up and suggests he take a break and go to town to have some fun. However, Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and also because he is "busted" and doesn't want to accumulate more debt.
