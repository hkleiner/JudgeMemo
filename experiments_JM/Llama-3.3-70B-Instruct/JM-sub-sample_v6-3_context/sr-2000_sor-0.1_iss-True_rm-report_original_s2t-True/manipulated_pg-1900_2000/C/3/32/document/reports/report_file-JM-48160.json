=== Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8216):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author had to obtain a special permit, known as a carnet rouge, which required multiple attempts and connections with influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received the permit, but was initially only allowed to visit Meaux and Rouen, which were not her desired destinations. She persisted and was eventually able to get permission to visit other base hospitals, although her request to visit Verdun was denied due to safety concerns. The author's first visit was to Meaux, where she witnessed the impressive and somber sight of the battlefield of the Marne, with its many graves and cemeteries.

Section section_02 (Chars 8217–11464):
Section Summary: The village of Barcy was heavily damaged during the war, with the church and several houses reduced to ruins. The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, enduring constant shelling. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter of introduction to facilitate their trip. They traveled to these destinations, observing many soldiers at the train station and on military trains, and were struck by the height and health of the French officers they met. The narrator was eager to experience the war firsthand, having been in Paris for three months with little evidence of the conflict beyond wounded soldiers in the streets.
