Section section_01 (Chars 0–8523):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, a new wave of pilgrims has emerged, traveling to Canterbury to visit the site of the shrine, with many taking the train but missing out on the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement called Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Roman occupation, the city was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many pilgrims visiting to experience the beauty and tragedy of the site.

Section section_02 (Chars 8524–12697):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber, with Canterbury as the metropolis of his dominions. Prior to 597, Canterbury was a heathen city, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard, who had introduced Christianity. In 597, Augustine arrived and began to preach and instruct the people, with Ethelbert providing him with quarters and allowing him to spread his message. As a result, many converts were made, including Ethelbert himself, and Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city's church, St. Martin's, is believed to be one of the earliest Christian churches in England, although its exact origins and age are still a matter of debate among historians and archaeologists.
