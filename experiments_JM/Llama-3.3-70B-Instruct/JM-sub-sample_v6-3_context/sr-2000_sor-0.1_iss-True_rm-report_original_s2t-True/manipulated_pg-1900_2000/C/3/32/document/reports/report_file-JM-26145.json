Section section_01 (Chars 0–8637):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Middle Egypt were discovered, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and found to be part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, revealed that this language was used for diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and included letters from Egyptian officials, Asiatic kings, and the Egyptian monarch. The discovery provided valuable insights into the administration and court of the Egyptian kings during the XVIIIth Dynasty, including the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, who introduced significant changes to the Egyptian religion and culture. The tablets also showcased the challenges of communication and writing in ancient times, with scribes using various techniques to overcome difficulties with the script and language.

Section section_02 (Chars 8638–12741):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, later known as Akhenaten, initially intended to introduce reforms gradually, but the resistance from the powerful priests of Amon led to more aggressive measures. The king's goal was to weaken the influence of the Theban hierarchy and strengthen the royal power by promoting the worship of the Sun's Disk, or "Aten". Akhenaten established a new capital, Akhet-Aten, and introduced a new doctrine that was seen as heretical due to its basis on natural phenomena rather than mythology. The officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, and some, such as Ai and Amanappa, held important positions in the government. The introduction of the Aten dogma marked a significant shift in Egyptian religion, with a more monotheistic tendency and a richer expression of devout feeling, as evident in the hymns found in the tombs.
