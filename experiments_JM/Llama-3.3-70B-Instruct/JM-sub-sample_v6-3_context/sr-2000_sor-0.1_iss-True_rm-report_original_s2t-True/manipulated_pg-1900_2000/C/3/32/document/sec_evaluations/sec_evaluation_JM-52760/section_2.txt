* [LOGIC] abrupt transition from discussing the importance of Petersburg to describing the Dimmock Line
* [STRUCTURE] the text jumps between different topics (railroads, fortifications, battles) without clear connections
* [CLARITY] the use of vague terms ("a thing", "the stuff") can make it difficult to follow the narrative
