His early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, with his father initially discouraging him and attempting to steer him towards a more practical career as a druggist. Despite this, Meissonier's talent and dedication eventually prevailed, and he went on to become a renowned artist.

Section section_02 (Chars 8415–12858):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. During his time at Cogniet's studio, Meissonier developed his skills by drawing soldiers and horses in uniform, which sparked his interest in historical subjects. Despite struggling financially, Meissonier shared his poverty with friends, including Daumier and Daubigny, and found ways to make a living, including decorating fans and creating illustrations for publishers. At the age of 16, Meissonier exhibited his first work, "A Visit to the Burgomaster," but it went largely unnoticed by the public. He eventually gained recognition from editors and art publishers, which marked the beginning of his successful career as an artist.
