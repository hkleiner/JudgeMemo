Section section_01 (Chars 0–8137):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a Colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and later asks for new works by Shakespeare and Milton demonstrates a natural affinity for literature, despite his lack of formal education. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting, popular books and timeless, classic literature.

Section section_02 (Chars 8137–11560):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact. A true classic, according to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, is a book that enriches the human mind, speaks to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcends the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author, a self-proclaimed bookman, values these classic works and seeks to collect them, including those on various subjects such as religion, as long as they demonstrate excellent style and wisdom. The author's goal is to distinguish between books that are merely entertaining and those that have a lasting, timeless quality.
