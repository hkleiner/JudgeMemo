Section section_01 (Chars 0–8102):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East failing to bring a decisive end to the war. The Union army, now led by General Ulysses S. Grant, launched a two-pronged attack to conquer the Confederacy, with one prong targeting Richmond and Petersburg. Grant's army clashed with General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but was unable to destroy Lee's army. The city of Petersburg, a vital transportation hub, became a key target for the Union army, as its capture would likely lead to the abandonment of Richmond. Grant's strategy shifted to isolating Richmond and Petersburg by attacking the city and cutting off its supply lines, setting the stage for the siege of Petersburg.

Section section_02 (Chars 8103–12766):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond and North Carolina. The city's railroads played a significant role in its importance, with tracks radiating in all directions, making it a vital point of transfer for products and materials. To protect the city, a 10-mile long defense line, known as the "Dimmock Line," was constructed, featuring 55 artillery batteries, but it had weaknesses and required more troops to defend than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, began to move towards Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps arriving on the scene on June 15, outnumbering the Confederate forces under General Beauregard. The Union army's goal was to capture the city and shut off the supplies streaming along the railroads, which were essential to the Confederate capital, Richmond.
