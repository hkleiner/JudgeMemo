Section section_01 (Chars 0–7940):
Section Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans. The narrative then shifts to the story of Donald, a young Scottish boy who finds a lost puppy in a lane near his home. Donald takes the puppy to his parents, and they decide to try to find its owner by advertising it in the paper and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he hopes to train it to be a sheep-dog. The family enjoys a traditional Scottish tea together, discussing their plans to visit Donald's uncle, who has invited them to a birthday party for his daughter Marjorie.

Section section_02 (Chars 7940–11802):
Section Summary: When Sandy and Don heard that their cousins, Janet and Marjorie, were visiting, they were overjoyed and started planning all the fun activities they could do together. Don was especially excited to share stories of his uncle's estate, Skylemore, in the Highlands, which he considered a palace. Uncle Alan, who had made a fortune in copper mines in America, had bought the estate and filled it with beautiful furniture, books, and artwork, and the surrounding park was perfect for hunting and fishing. Don loved hearing his uncle's stories of adventure and was amazed by his tales of America, with its big cities and vast wheat fields. The boys were thrilled to have their cousins visit and were looking forward to a wonderful week of fun and exploration.
