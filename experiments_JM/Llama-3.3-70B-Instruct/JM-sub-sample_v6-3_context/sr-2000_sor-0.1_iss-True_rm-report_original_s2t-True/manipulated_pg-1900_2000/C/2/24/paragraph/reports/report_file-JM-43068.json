Section section_02 (Chars 8909–12850):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and solitude of rural life, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen," which conveys the loneliness and hardship of a shepherd's daily labor. As a philosopher-artist, Millet's work reflects his profound understanding of the human experience and the natural world. His art is a testament to his observation of and empathy for the simple, everyday lives of peasants and laborers.
