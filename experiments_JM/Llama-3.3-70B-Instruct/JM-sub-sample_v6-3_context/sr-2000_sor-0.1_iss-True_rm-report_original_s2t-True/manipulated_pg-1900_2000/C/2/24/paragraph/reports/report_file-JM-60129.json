Section section_01 (Chars 0–8426):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from other groups like the Tangutans. The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago, and now live in scattered villages, speaking a language similar to Khirgis and Turkish. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earn a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and are responsible for educating local boys for the priestly office. The villagers pay a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government, which is collected by an officer stationed in a nearby town.

Section section_02 (Chars 8427–12850):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and heated sleeping stoves. Their household utensils and clothing are mostly of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences, and are made from home-spun materials. The women's head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, copper rings, and metal ornaments. The Yögur people have limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult to collect ethnographic items as they only replace old items when they are falling apart. They have some basic handicrafts, including weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with the women weaving cloth on primitive looms and the men making baskets and knitting stockings.
