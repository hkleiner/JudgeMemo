Section section_01 (Chars 0–8375):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and provided insight into the administration and court of the Egyptian pharaohs during the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had expanded its empire into Asia under King Thutmosis III, but later shifted its focus to more peaceful pursuits under Amenophis III and IV.

Section section_02 (Chars 8376–12900):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion in Egypt, worshiping the sun disk, or Aten, as the primary deity. He attempted to reform the traditional Egyptian religion, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, leading to open strife and the relocation of the royal court to Tell el Amarna. The new capital, Akhet-Aten, was consecrated, and officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, with some even changing their names to reflect their allegiance to the Aten. The impact of the new religion was largely limited to Egypt, with foreign officials in Syria and Palestine initially unaware of the changes. The Aten dogma represented a shift towards a more natural and spontaneous form of worship, but its true significance and influence are still a matter of interpretation.
