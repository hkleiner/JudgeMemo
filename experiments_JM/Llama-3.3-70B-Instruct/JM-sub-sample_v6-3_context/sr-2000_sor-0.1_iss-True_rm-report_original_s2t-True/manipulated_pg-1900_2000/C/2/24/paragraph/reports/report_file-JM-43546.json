Section Summary: The story begins with a preface introducing the idea that Scottish and American cultures have much in common, and that Scottish legends and stories are of great interest to Americans.

Donald takes the puppy to his parents, and they decide to try to find its owner by advertising and giving notice at the police station. If no one claims the puppy, Donald is allowed to keep it, and he hopes to train it to be a sheep-dog. The family enjoys a warm and lively afternoon tea together, discussing their plans and looking forward to a upcoming visit to Donald's uncle's home.

Section Summary: When Sandy and Don heard that their cousins, Janet and Marjorie, were visiting, they were overjoyed and started planning all the fun activities they could do together. Don was particularly excited to share stories of his uncle's estate, Skylemore, in the Highlands, which he considered a palace. Uncle Alan, who had made a fortune in America, had bought the estate and filled it with beautiful furniture, books, and artwork, and the surrounding park was perfect for hunting and fishing.
