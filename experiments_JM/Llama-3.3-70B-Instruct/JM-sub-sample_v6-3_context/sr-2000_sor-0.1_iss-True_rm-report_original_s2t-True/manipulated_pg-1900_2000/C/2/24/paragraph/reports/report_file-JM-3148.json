Section section_02 (Chars 8031–11639):
Section Summary: Anthony, a curious and lazy boy, would often sneak out of the classroom to snap a tuning fork, which was his way of saving his soul. Despite being considered the laziest boy in the village, Anthony was actually industrious in his own pursuits, constantly seeking answers to his many questions about the world. He was fascinated by the natural world and spent much of his time exploring the woods, learning about plants, birds, and other wonders. Anthony's self-education in the woods was not recognized by the villagers, but his mother acknowledged that he had a wealth of "useless information" about the natural world. Through his own efforts, Anthony developed a deep understanding of the world around him, driven by his insatiable curiosity and desire to learn.
