Section section_02 (Chars 8847–12052):
Section Summary: The narrator arrived in Manila during the rainy season, which made their clothing damp and uncomfortable. The city of Manila was built by the Spaniards and has a rich history, with an old walled city and a new city that has sprung up around it. The narrator observed the bustling activity on the old stone bridge, where people from various nationalities and professions, including Americans, Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos, crossed paths. The scene was chaotic yet fascinating, with steam launches and inter-island steamers in the river and small boats loaded with native produce along the bank. After spending two weeks in Manila, the narrator and others received a notice instructing them to prepare for assignment to their stations by gathering certain supplies.
