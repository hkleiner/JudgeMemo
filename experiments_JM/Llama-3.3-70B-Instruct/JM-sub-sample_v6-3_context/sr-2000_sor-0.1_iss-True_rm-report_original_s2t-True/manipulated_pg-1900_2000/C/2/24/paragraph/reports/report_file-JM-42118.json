Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a picturesque and romantic environment, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a different path, with his master eventually advising him to follow his artistic bent.

Section section_02 (Chars 7896–13073):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old Fragonard and his mother traveled to Paris to meet the renowned painter Boucher, who advised them that Fragonard needed more training and recommended Chardin as a master to learn from. However, Fragonard made little progress under Chardin and was eventually sent away. After six months of studying and practicing on his own, Fragonard returned to Boucher and was accepted into his studio, where he worked on decorative cartoons and enlargements for tapestries. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's skills improved, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." Fragonard then continued to work and study, eventually becoming one of the king's six élèves protégés under Carle Van Loo.
