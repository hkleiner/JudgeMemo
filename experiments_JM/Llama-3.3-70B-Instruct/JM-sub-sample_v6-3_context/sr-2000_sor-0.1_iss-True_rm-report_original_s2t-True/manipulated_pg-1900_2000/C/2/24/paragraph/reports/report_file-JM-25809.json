Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is sitting on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated despite the beautiful surroundings.

He reads a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, and he is hurt and enraged by her words. Jim's friend Bud, the mail-carrier, arrives and tries to cheer him up, suggesting that he take a break and go to town to have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and is too broke to indulge. Jim is torn between his desire to be with Anne and his inability to provide for her, leaving him feeling defeated and demoralized.

Section Summary: Jim and Bud are having a conversation, with Bud trying to convince Jim to take some money and a horse to go to Plattsburg, a town 50 miles away. Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him from a nearby herd. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim prepares to ride. Before they part ways, Bud tells Jim about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but only got $10 and a warning from Bud. Jim and Bud then ride off together, eventually reaching a fork in the trail where they will separate.
