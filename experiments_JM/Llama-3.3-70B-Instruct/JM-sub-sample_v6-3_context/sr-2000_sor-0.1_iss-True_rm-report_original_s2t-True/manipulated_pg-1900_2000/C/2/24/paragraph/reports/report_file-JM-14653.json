Section section_01 (Chars 0–8500):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, filled with secrets, gift-giving, and feasting, but now it has become more of a commercialized and obligatory celebration. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in the way people perceive and experience Christmas. Children still embody the true spirit of Christmas, but adults have lost some of their enthusiasm and faith in the holiday. The author argues that acknowledging and understanding this change is essential, rather than simply denying or ignoring it.

Section section_02 (Chars 8500–12669):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century idealists, such as scientists and philosophers, who prioritized truth and curiosity over faith and sentiment. Their discoveries and ideas led to an age of skepticism, causing people to question and eventually dismiss long-held beliefs, including the traditional depiction of Christmas. As a result, faith and principles are now undervalued, and people are left feeling uncertain and cynical, particularly during Christmas. However, despite this, people still instinctively try to keep the Christmas spirit alive, suggesting that they recognize its importance on a deeper level. Ultimately, the core principles of Christmas, such as goodwill and charity, remain intact and essential for human dignity and existence.
