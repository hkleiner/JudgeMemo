Section Summary: Kuei Ping cherished a memory of her last day at school, where she had a meaningful conversation with her American teacher, Miss Porter, in the garden. Miss Porter had inspired Kuei Ping with the idea of freedom and equal opportunity, and had encouraged her to pursue her dreams in the United States. However, Kuei Ping knew that her family had already planned her marriage and expected her to fulfill her traditional role, creating a conflict within her. She had ultimately decided not to pursue her dreams, and the memory of her conversation with Miss Porter remained bittersweet.
