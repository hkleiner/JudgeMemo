Section section_01 (Chars 0–8182):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a wealthy man who owns a large, expensive bookcase, but lacks a genuine love for the books themselves. In contrast, a colonial squatter who requests books from a friend and develops a taste for classic literature, such as Shakespeare and Milton, demonstrates a more authentic connection to books. Ultimately, the author suggests that a bookman is someone who can distinguish between fleeting popular literature and timeless, meaningful works.

Section section_02 (Chars 8182–11681):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact. A true classic, according to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, is a book that enriches the human mind, speaks to all in a unique yet universal style, and transcends the limitations of its time. Such books, like those of Homer, Virgil, and Shakespeare, are considered immortal and continue to inspire generations. The author, a bookman, values these classic works and seeks to collect them, including those from various religious traditions, such as Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" and A'Kempis, appreciating their literary merit regardless of their subject matter. The author's goal is to distinguish between books that are ephemeral and those that have a lasting, necessary presence in the literary canon.
