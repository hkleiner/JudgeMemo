=== Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8299):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, which was difficult to obtain, and required help from influential people, including a duchess. After a month of waiting, the author finally received a permit, known as a carnet rouge, which allowed her to visit certain base hospitals, but not the front lines as she had hoped. The author was initially offered permission to visit Rouen and Meaux, but she refused and asked to visit other locations, including Bar-le-Duc and Verdun, which were closer to the action. The author eventually visited Meaux, where she saw the impressive and somber sights of the battlefield of the Marne, including fields of graves marked with flags and crosses.

Section section_02 (Chars 8300–11649):
Section Summary: The village of Barcy was heavily damaged during the war, with the church and several houses reduced to ruins. The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, listening to shells shriek overhead. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter asking the military authorities to show them every civility. The narrator set off on the trip alone, observing many healthy and contented soldiers at the train station and on the train, where they noted the officers' impressive height. The trip was an opportunity for the narrator to experience the war firsthand, after spending three months in the relative comfort of Paris.
