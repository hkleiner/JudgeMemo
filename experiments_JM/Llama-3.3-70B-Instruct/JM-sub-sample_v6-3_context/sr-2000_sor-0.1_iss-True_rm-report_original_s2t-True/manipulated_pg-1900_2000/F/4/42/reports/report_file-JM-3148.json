Section section_02 (Chars 7995–11541):
Section Summary: The teacher often struggled to keep her students engaged, especially on hot afternoons, and Anthony would sometimes sneak out of the window to play with a tuning fork. As he grew older, Anthony was considered the laziest boy in the village, but this was because he was more interested in pursuing his own interests and learning through personal discovery. He was a curious boy, always asking questions about the world around him, such as why the sun rises and what makes seeds grow. Despite the limited school year, Anthony educated himself by exploring the woods and learning about nature, discovering hidden gems like rare flowers and bird songs. He spent his free time observing and imitating the natural world, gathering knowledge and information that others considered useless, but was precious to him.
