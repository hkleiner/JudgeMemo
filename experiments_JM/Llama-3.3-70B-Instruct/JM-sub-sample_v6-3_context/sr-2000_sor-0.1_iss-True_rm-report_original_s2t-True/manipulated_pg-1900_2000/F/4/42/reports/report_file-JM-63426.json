The chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, growing up in Massachusetts and later moving to Northern Michigan with his mother. Bradley's early interest in art and printing is evident, and he spends much of his childhood dreaming of becoming an artist and finding ways to pursue his passion despite financial constraints.

As they gain experience, their wages increase, and they become responsible for all presswork, eventually earning $15 a week by the age of 15.
