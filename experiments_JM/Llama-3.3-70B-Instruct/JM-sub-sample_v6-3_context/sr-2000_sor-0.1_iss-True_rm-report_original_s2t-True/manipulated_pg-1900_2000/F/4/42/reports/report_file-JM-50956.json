Section section_01 (Chars 0–8721):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and military efforts, including the Brusilov offensive, helped to save Italy and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme and at Verdun. Germany's plan to defeat France quickly was thwarted by Russia's entry into the war, and it is unlikely that Germany could have won the war without Russia's participation. Russia's role in the war was crucial, and its efforts, although often overlooked, were instrumental in the ultimate defeat of Prussian militarism.

Section section_02 (Chars 8721–13137):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, relied on concentrating all forces against France, but this was thwarted when Russia launched a surprise attack on East Prussia, diverting German troops. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and gave France a crucial advantage, ultimately leading to the German defeat on the Marne. Russia's early efforts played a significant role in the war, as they bore the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's contributions are often overlooked due to the extraordinary conditions that developed towards the end of the war. German General Ludendorf's memoirs have also contributed to this oversight, as they attempt to slander the Russian Army and distort the historic perspective of the war.
