Section section_01 (Chars 0–7791):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, sits on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated with his lack of success in finding gold. He reads a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation, and he becomes enraged and hurt. Despite his feelings, Jim is consoled by the thought of being with Anne in the gulch, even without wealth. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too broke and also influenced by the idea that Anne is always watching over him. Jim's situation is further complicated by his sense of responsibility and his desire to prove himself to Anne.

Section Summary: Bud tries to convince Jim to take some money and have a good time, but Jim is hesitant.

Jim and Bud then set off together, with Jim riding the burro, and part ways at the fork in the trail.
