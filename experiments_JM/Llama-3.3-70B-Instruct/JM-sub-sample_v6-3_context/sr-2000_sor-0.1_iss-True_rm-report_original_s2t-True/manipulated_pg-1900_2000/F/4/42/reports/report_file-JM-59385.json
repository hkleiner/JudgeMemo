Section Summary: The narrator dedicates a story to the women of America about her Chinese friend and teacher, which takes place on the Street of Precious Pearls, a significant location for Chinese girls where they buy their dowry jewels. Yen Kuei Ping, a young girl, visits the street with her grandmother, mother, and a relative to purchase jewels for her dowry, following an ancient custom where a bride converts her inheritance into precious stones. At a shop, they are greeted by the owner, Wong Lui, and his staff, and a selection of rich jewels is presented to them, with Madame Yen and her daughter showing a preference for pearls. As they carefully select the most beautiful pearls, a bargaining process ensues between Madame Yen and Wong Lui, with Kuei Ping eventually gathering a handful of the chosen pearls in her hand.
