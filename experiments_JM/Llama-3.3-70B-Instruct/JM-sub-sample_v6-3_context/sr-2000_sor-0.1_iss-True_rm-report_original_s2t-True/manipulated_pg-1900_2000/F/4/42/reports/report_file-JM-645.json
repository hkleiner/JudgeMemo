Section section_01 (Chars 0–7850):
Section Summary: The narrator's career as a writer takes off when his friend George Corvick asks him to review Hugh Vereker's new novel for "The Middle" magazine. Corvick is unable to write the review himself due to a personal emergency and entrusts the narrator with the task, urging him to truly understand Vereker's work. The narrator writes the review, but Corvick is dissatisfied, feeling that it doesn't capture the essence of Vereker's writing. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but is unable to discuss his review with him, although Lady Jane eventually brings it up and praises the narrator's work. The narrator is left wondering if he has truly done justice to Vereker's writing, and if he has been able to convey the depth of his understanding.

Section section_02 (Chars 7850–11225):
Section Summary: Lady Jane is excited to show a review of Hugh Vereker's work to him, and she has marked the most flattering passages. The author of the review, who is also present, reveals to Lady Jane that they wrote the piece, but she seems less impressed than expected. At dinner, the author hopes to see Vereker's reaction to the review, but Lady Jane doesn't bring it up. However, another guest, Miss Poyle, asks Vereker about the review, and to the author's surprise, Vereker dismisses it as "the usual twaddle" and later says the author "doesn't see anything", implying that the review missed the deeper meaning of his work. Vereker's response is casual and humorous, but it suggests that he is not satisfied with the review.
