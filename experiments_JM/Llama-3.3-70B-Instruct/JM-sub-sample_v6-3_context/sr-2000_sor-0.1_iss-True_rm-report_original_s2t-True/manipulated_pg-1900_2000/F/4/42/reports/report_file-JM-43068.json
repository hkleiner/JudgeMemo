Section section_01 (Chars 0–8846):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, often compared to Dutch masters such as Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth, sincerity, and profound rendering of everyday peasant life, tinged with a melancholy fervor. His paintings, such as "The Angelus," capture the struggles and simple faith of rural life, and are not sentimental but rather a genuine portrayal of the human experience. Millet's unique style, influenced by Italian Renaissance masters like Andrea Mantegna, is marked by subtlety and restraint, rather than showy technique. As a painter, Millet's strength lies in his ability to convey a powerful message and emotional depth, rather than in flashy brushwork or technical pyrotechnics.

Section section_02 (Chars 8847–12750):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and simplicity of rural life, often focusing on the loneliness and hardships of the peasant's labor. His work reveals a philosophical mind that grappled with the problems of life, and his poverty and connection to the natural world likely influenced his artistic perspective. Overall, Millet's art is marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep understanding of the human experience.
