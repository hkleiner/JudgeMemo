Section section_01 (Chars 0–8184):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to defeat General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Major General Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to lead the Union armies, and he launched a two-pronged attack, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg, and the other, led by General William T. Sherman, targeting Atlanta and the Confederacy's western strongholds. Grant's army clashed with Lee's in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately decided to shift his focus to Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to defeating the Confederacy, as it would cut off Richmond's supply lines and likely lead to the city's abandonment.

Section section_02 (Chars 8185–12923):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the "Dimmock Line," was constructed around Petersburg, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line had weaknesses and required more troops to defend it than were available, making it vulnerable to attack. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, began to move towards Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps arriving on the scene on June 15, outnumbering the Confederate forces under General Beauregard.
