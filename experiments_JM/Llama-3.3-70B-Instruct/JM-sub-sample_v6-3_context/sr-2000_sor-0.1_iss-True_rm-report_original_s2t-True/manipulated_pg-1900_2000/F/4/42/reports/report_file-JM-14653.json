Section section_01 (Chars 0–8419):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has lost its magic and excitement for adults, who now have to force themselves to enjoy the holiday. In contrast, children still experience the wonder and joy of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what helps adults to pretend to feel the same way. The author argues that Christmas was once a truly special and romantic day, but now it has become a time of gluttony, expensiveness, and obligation. The decline of Christmas is not just a personal experience, but a widespread phenomenon that can be seen in the way people approach the holiday with a sense of duty rather than genuine excitement. The author suggests that the true spirit of Christmas has been diminished, and that this is a fact that should be acknowledged and confronted rather than ignored.

Section section_02 (Chars 8419–12553):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who prioritized truth and skepticism over faith and tradition. This age of doubt and skepticism has led people to question and abandon long-held beliefs, resulting in a loss of faith and enthusiasm. However, despite the changes brought about by science and philosophy, fundamental principles such as dignity, mutual goodwill, and charity remain essential for human existence. Deep down, people recognize the importance of the Christmas spirit and strive to preserve it, even if they don't fully understand why. Ultimately, the core of Christmas remains intact, and people's efforts to keep its spirit alive reflect a profound instinct that it is essential to their well-being.
