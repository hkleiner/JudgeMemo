Section section_01 (Chars 0–8447):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and realistic style, which is exemplified by an anecdote where he arranged for a squadron of cuirassiers to trample a field of grain so he could study the effects of cavalry on the landscape. Meissonier's artistic career was marked by a devotion to realism, and he refused to paint battles or skirmishes because he had never witnessed one and did not want to compromise his commitment to accuracy. His early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, despite his father's initial disapproval and attempts to steer him towards a more practical career. Meissonier's talent and dedication eventually earned him recognition, and he became a respected artist in his own right, known for his precise and detailed paintings.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–12899):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. During his time at Cogniet's studio, Meissonier was inspired by the Napoleonic Epic and developed his artistic skills, but struggled financially, living on a small allowance and occasionally selling his work. He shared his poverty with friends, including Daumier and Daubigny, and found ways to make a living, including decorating fans and creating illustrations for publishers. At the age of 16, Meissonier exhibited his first work, "A Visit to the Burgomaster," but it went largely unnoticed by the public. He eventually found success as an illustrator, after a chance encounter with the art-publisher Curmer, who was impressed by his work on life-masks.
