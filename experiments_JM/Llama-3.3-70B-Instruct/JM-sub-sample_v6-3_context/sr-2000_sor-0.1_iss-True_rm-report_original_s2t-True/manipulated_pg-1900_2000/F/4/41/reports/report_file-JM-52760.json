Section section_01 (Chars 0–8192):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union forces had failed to defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee. In 1864, Union General Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to lead the Union armies and devised a two-pronged attack to conquer the Confederacy, with one prong targeting Richmond and Petersburg. Grant's army clashed with Lee's in a series of bloody battles, including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, but ultimately decided to target Petersburg, a crucial supply hub for the Confederacy. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to defeating the Confederacy, as it would cut off supplies to Richmond and likely lead to the city's abandonment.

Section section_02 (Chars 8193–12931):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads made it a significant location, and by June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond passed through Petersburg. To protect the city, a 10-mile defense line, known as the "Dimmock Line," was constructed around Petersburg, but it had weaknesses and required more troops to defend than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, began to move towards Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps arriving on the scene on June 15, outnumbering the Confederate forces under General Beauregard. The Union army's goal was to capture Petersburg and cut off supplies to Richmond, ultimately threatening the Confederate capital.
