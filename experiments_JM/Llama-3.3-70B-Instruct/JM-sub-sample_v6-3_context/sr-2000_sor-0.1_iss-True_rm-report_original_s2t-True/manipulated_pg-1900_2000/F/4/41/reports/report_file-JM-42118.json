Section section_01 (Chars 0–7792):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a picturesque Provençal setting, Fragonard was surrounded by natural beauty that would later influence his art. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful patron of the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary's clerk, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a different path, with his master eventually advising that he be allowed to follow his artistic bent. Fragonard's early life in Grasse and his exposure to the beauty of the region would have a lasting impact on his artistic style and development.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–12969):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the renowned painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, impressed by the boy's potential but recognizing his lack of skill, advised him to train with Chardin, a master of still-life painting. However, Fragonard made little progress under Chardin and was eventually sent away, prompting him to develop his skills on his own by copying masterpieces from memory. After six months, Fragonard returned to Boucher, who was impressed by his progress and took him on as a student, providing him with ideal training by working on large decorative cartoons. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's skills flourished, and he went on to win the prestigious Prix de Rome at the age of 20.
