Section section_01 (Chars 0–8315):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and provided insight into the administration and court of the Egyptian pharaohs during the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had expanded Egypt's borders through conquests in Asia and Africa.

Section section_02 (Chars 8316–12794):
Section Summary: The Egyptian king, Amenophis IV, later known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion that worshipped the sun disk, Aten, as the chief deity. He attempted to reform the traditional Egyptian religion, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, leading to open strife and the eventual relocation of the court to a new city, Akhet-Aten. The king and his officials adopted new names and titles to reflect their allegiance to the Aten, but the new doctrine was not widely accepted, especially among foreign officials in Syria and Palestine. The Aten dogma represented a significant shift in religious thought, emphasizing natural phenomena over mythology, and was characterized by a more personal and spontaneous expression of devotion. The king rewarded officials who accepted the new doctrine, granting them honors and important positions, such as Ai, who received golden honors and served as a royal scribe and ambassador.
