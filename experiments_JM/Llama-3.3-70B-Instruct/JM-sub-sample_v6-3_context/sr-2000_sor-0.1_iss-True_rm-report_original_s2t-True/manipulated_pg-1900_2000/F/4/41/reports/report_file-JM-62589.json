Section Summary: Debby Mason, a 14-year-old girl, lives with her father in a log house in Plymouth, but their life is marked by poverty and neglect due to her father's drunkenness.

Debby's father joins a group of men headed to Boston to fight, leaving Debby behind, and she is forced to live with Mrs. Lane, where she is miserable and longs for her father. Despite learning useful skills and growing stronger, Debby's heart remains hard and bitter, and she finds comfort in secretly playing her drum, a childhood treasure.
