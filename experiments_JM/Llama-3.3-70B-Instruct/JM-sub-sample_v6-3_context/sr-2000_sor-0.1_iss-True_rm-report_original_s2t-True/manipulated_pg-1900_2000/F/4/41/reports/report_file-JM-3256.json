Section section_01 (Chars 0–7800):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, noting that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point with two anecdotes: one about a wealthy man who owns an impressive library but lacks a genuine love for books, and another about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of education, instinctively recognizes the value of classic literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both light and serious reading, and that the ability to distinguish between fleeting and enduring literature is a key characteristic of a true bookman. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, unassuming reader who can appreciate great literature over the pretentious collector or critic.

Section section_02 (Chars 7800–11574):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between popular novels that are quickly forgotten and classic books that stand the test of time. A true book lover can distinguish between books that are merely entertaining and those that have lasting value and wisdom. According to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, a classic book is one that enriches the human mind, speaks to all people, and has a timeless style. The subject matter of a book is not as important as its literary quality, and a bookman can appreciate works from various genres and perspectives, such as Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" and A'Kempis' writings. Ultimately, a classic book is like a cathedral that towers above ordinary books, providing inspiration and peace to many generations.
