Section section_01 (Chars 0–8064):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife are on their way to the Battersea Home for Lost Dogs to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. After arriving in Battersea, they try to find the dog home, but their attempts at getting directions are met with a mischievous street boy's suggestion to "bite a policeman." They then spot an official from the dog home and decide to follow him discreetly, but this proves to be a challenging and humiliating task. As they trail behind the official, they find themselves in various awkward situations, including encounters with shopkeepers and pedestrians.

Section section_02 (Chars 8065–12617):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife, Stella, were trying to follow a man who they believed was going to the Dogs' Home to collect a dog for them. However, they ended up chasing him through the streets, only to discover that he was actually returning to his own home. Exhausted and discomfited, they gave up and went home, with Stella feeling unstrung and unwilling to discuss the failed dog-collecting mission. The next evening, as they walked home across the golf course, Stella was still shaken by the experience and didn't want to see a dog again. The narrator suggested advertising for a dog, but Stella was not interested, and instead became distracted by something she saw near a small sheet of water on the golf course.
