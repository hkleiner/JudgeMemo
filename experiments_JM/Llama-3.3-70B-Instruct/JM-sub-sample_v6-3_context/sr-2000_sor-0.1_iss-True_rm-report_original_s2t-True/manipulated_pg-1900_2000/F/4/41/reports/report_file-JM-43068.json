Section section_02 (Chars 8763–12746):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's artistic style is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and solitude of peasant life, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen," which conveys the loneliness and hardship of rural labor. As a philosopher-artist, Millet's work reflects his profound understanding of the human experience and the everyday struggles of the common people. His art is marked by a sense of melancholy and social awareness, which sets him apart as a unique and powerful voice.
