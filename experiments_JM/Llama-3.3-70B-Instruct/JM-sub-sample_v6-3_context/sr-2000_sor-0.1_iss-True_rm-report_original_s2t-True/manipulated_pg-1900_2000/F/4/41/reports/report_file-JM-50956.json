Section section_01 (Chars 0–8573):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which were more than twice those of France and thirty-five times those of America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts weakened the enemy's resources, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory. Russia's sacrifices and military efforts, including the Brusilov offensive, helped to save Italy and facilitated the operations of the Allies on the Somme and at Verdun. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's participation in the war was crucial, and its contributions should not be measured solely by its losses, but also by its significant impact on the course of the war.

Section section_02 (Chars 8574–13144):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, aimed to concentrate all forces against France, but this plan was foiled when Russia, despite being unprepared, launched an attack on East Prussia, diverting German forces. This self-sacrificing move by Russia played a crucial role in the outcome of the war, as it prevented Germany from achieving a decisive victory on the Western Front. The Russian Army's efforts, along with those of France, bore the brunt of the fighting against the Central Powers during the early years of the war. However, the significance of Russia's contributions is being obscured by false narratives, including those presented in General Ludendorff's memoirs, which attempt to discredit the Russian Army. Overall, Russia's role in the war was instrumental in preventing a German victory, and its sacrifices should be recognized as a crucial factor in the Allied victory.
