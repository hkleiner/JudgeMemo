Section section_01 (Chars 0–7709):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for "The Middle" magazine, as Corvick has to leave suddenly for Paris. The narrator is eager to read the novel and write the review, especially since he will be meeting Vereker at a social gathering, and he wants to make a good impression. After writing the review, the narrator feels confident, but his confidence wanes when Corvick expresses dissatisfaction with the review. The narrator meets Vereker at the gathering, but Vereker doesn't seem to have read the review, and the narrator is tempted to bring it up, but doesn't get the chance. Eventually, Lady Jane mentions the review, potentially doing the narrator a favor by bringing it to Vereker's attention.

Section section_02 (Chars 7709–11221):
Section Summary: Lady Jane enthusiastically shares a review of Hugh Vereker's work with a couple, highlighting the parts where the author has captured Vereker's essence. The reviewer is later revealed to be the narrator, but Lady Jane's excitement is somewhat dampened by this discovery. At dinner, the narrator hopes to gauge Vereker's reaction to the review, but Lady Jane doesn't give him the opportunity. However, when Miss Poyle, a guest, asks Vereker about the review, he dismissively calls it "the usual twaddle," which surprises the narrator. Vereker later softens his tone, saying the article is "charming," but implies that the author has missed the deeper meaning of his work.
