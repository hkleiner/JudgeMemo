Section Summary: Paolo Veronese, born Paolo Caliari in 1528 in Verona, was a renowned painter known for his unique blend of absurdity and adorability. He was trained by his uncle, Antonio Badile, and developed his skills in line drawing by copying the engravings of masters like Albert Durer and Lucas Van Leyden. Veronese's early works already showed promise, and he quickly gained recognition in Verona and beyond, receiving commissions from prominent clients like Cardinal Ercole di Gonzaga. He eventually outgrew the limited opportunities in Verona and moved to other cities, including Venice, which would later become the inspiration for many of his works. Veronese's passion for Venice and its vibrant culture would ultimately shape his distinctive style, characterized by magnificent color and expression.
