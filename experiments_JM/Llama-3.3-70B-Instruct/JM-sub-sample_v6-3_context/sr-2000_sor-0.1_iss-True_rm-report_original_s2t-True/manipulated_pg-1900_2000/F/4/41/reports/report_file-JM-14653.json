Section section_01 (Chars 0–8278):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, filled with secrets, gift-giving, and celebration, but now it often feels like a chore, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author suggests that children are the ones who still truly believe in the spirit of Christmas, and that adults have lost some of their faith and enthusiasm for the holiday. The decline of Christmas is not just a personal experience, but a widespread phenomenon that can be observed in the way people approach the holiday. The author argues that acknowledging and understanding this decline is the first step towards addressing it and potentially revitalizing the true spirit of Christmas.

Section section_02 (Chars 8278–12556):
Section Summary: The author believes that the true Christmas spirit has been diminished in the hearts of adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sparked an age of doubt and skepticism. This era of skepticism has led people to question and abandon their faith, not just in religious facts, but also in principles and ideals. As a result, qualities like enthusiasm, spontaneity, and sentiment have become undervalued, and people are left feeling lost and uncertain. Despite this, the author argues that the core principles of Christmas, such as faith, goodwill, and charity, remain intact and essential for human dignity and survival. Ultimately, the author suggests that people still instinctively recognize the importance of the Christmas spirit, even if they don't consciously acknowledge it.
