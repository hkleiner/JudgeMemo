Section section_01 (Chars 0–7779):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, sits on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated despite the beautiful surroundings. He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. He reads a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, and he is filled with emotions, feeling hurt and enraged. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and although Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, Jim declines, feeling a sense of responsibility and awareness of Anne's expectations. Jim's financial struggles are further emphasized by his admission to Bud that he is "busted," highlighting his current state of poverty.

Section Summary: Jim and Bud are having a conversation, with Bud trying to convince Jim to take some money and a horse to go to Plattsburg, a town 50 miles away. Jim declines, but instead asks Bud to round up a burro for him from a nearby herd. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim prepares to ride. Before they part ways, Bud tells Jim about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but only got $10 and a warning from Bud.
