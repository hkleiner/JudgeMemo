Section section_01 (Chars 0–8035):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is informed by the Port Security Officer, Chind Ramar, that the Irwadi government has "planetarized" the Interstellar Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots and ships. Ramsey, an Earthman, is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told to find a way to support himself until he can be removed from the planet. He meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is also struggling financially, and offers to help him out with a loan. Englander is hesitant to accept charity, but Ramsey insists it's a loan that can be repaid when he's able. The situation is dire, with many outworlders, including Ramsey and Englander, facing an uncertain future on the hostile planet of Irwadi.

Section section_02 (Chars 8036–13232):
Section Summary: Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to support his family, and gives him 375 credits to help out. Englander is grateful and promises to use the money wisely, while Ramsey is left with almost 25 credits. Despite his initial good intentions, Ramsey decides to gamble and ends up losing most of his money. He then gets into a confrontation with a drunk and arrogant Irwadian who is looking for trouble, and is told to leave the gambling hall. The situation becomes tense, with the Irwadian blaming outworlders like Ramsey for bringing poverty and problems to Irwadi.
