At a shop with rich filigree carvings, they are greeted by the owner, Wong Lui, and his staff, who bring out exquisite gems, including pearls, which Madame Yen and her daughter prefer.

Section section_02 (Chars 8381–11996):
Section Summary: Kuei Ping cherished a memory of her time in school, particularly a conversation with her American teacher, Miss Porter, who inspired her with ideas of freedom and equality. However, Kuei Ping's family had already planned her marriage, and she felt bound by her family ties and unable to pursue her own desires. She had to decline Miss Porter's suggestion that she study in the United States, which left her feeling regretful and torn between her loyalty to her family and her own aspirations. The memory of this conversation and her decision still weighed heavily on her mind as she sat with her grandmother, Madame Yen, discussing her upcoming marriage. Kuei Ping's heart remained conflicted, with her desire for freedom and independence at odds with her family's traditional expectations.
