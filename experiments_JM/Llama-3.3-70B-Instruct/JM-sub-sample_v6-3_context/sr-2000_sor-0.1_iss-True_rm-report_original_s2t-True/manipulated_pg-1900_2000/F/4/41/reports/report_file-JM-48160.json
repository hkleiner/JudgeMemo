Section section_01 (Chars 0–8051):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. To enter the war zone, the author needed a special permit, known as a carnet rouge, which was difficult to obtain. After weeks of trying, the author finally received the permit with the help of a duchess and a vice-president of a charity, allowing her to visit certain base hospitals. However, her initial request to visit Amiens was denied due to its proximity to the front lines, and she was instead given permission to visit other locations, including Meaux, where she witnessed the impressive and somber sight of the Marne battlefield. The author's goal was to see the war effort firsthand and write about it, particularly to help a charity that supported wounded soldiers.

Section section_02 (Chars 8051–11523):
Section Summary: The village of Barcy was heavily damaged during the war, with its church and several houses reduced to ruins, and its people forced to take shelter in cellars for days. The author was later granted permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter of introduction to facilitate their trip. Despite initial disappointment at not being allowed to go closer to the front lines, the author was won over by the politeness of the officials and set off on their journey alone. At the Gare de l'Est station, the author was struck by the large number of healthy and contented soldiers, and on the train to Châlons, they observed the tall and imposing French officers. The author was eager to experience the reality of war firsthand, having been sheltered in Paris for three months, and was hopeful that something significant would happen during their trip.
