Section section_01 (Chars 0–8842):
Section Summary: Jean François Millet is a prominent painter of peasant life, and his work is a direct descendant of the Dutch masters, particularly Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Millet's paintings, such as "The Angelus," capture the simplicity and struggles of rural life with incisive truth and sincerity, and are characterized by their subtlety and restraint. His art is not just a representation of peasant life, but also a reflection of his own experiences and struggles, and conveys a message about the importance of work and the consoling influence of religion. Millet's unique style and technique, which emphasize atmosphere and line, can only be fully appreciated by those familiar with the countryside he depicted. Despite his restrained approach, Millet's work is considered great and enduring, and his ability to convey a message and evoke emotion sets him apart from other painters.

Section section_02 (Chars 8843–12746):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and solitude of peasant life, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen," which conveys the loneliness and hardship of rural labor. As a philosopher-artist, Millet's work reflects his profound understanding of the human experience and the natural world. His art is marked by a sense of melancholy and introspection, which was deeply rooted in his own life experiences and observations of the world around him.
