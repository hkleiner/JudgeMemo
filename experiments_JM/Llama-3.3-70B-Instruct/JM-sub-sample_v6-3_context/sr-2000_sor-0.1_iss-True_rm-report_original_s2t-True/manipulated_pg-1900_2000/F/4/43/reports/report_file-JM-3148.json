Section section_02 (Chars 8003–11543):
Section Summary: The teacher would sometimes fall into a brief period of apathy, allowing Anthony to sneak out of the window and snap a tuning fork to stay awake. As he grew older, Anthony was considered the laziest boy in the village, but this was because he was preoccupied with his own pursuits and interests. He was a curious and inquiring boy, constantly asking questions about the world around him and seeking to understand the natural world. Anthony spent his free time exploring the woods, learning about plants and animals, and imitating the songs of wild birds. Despite being seen as lazy, Anthony had a wealth of knowledge about the natural world and was always seeking to learn more.
