Section section_01 (Chars 0–8421):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has lost its magic and excitement for adults, who now have to force themselves to enjoy the holiday. In contrast, children still experience the wonder and joy of Christmas, and their enthusiasm is what helps adults to pretend to feel the same way. The author argues that Christmas was once a truly special and romantic day, but now it has become a time of gluttony, expensiveness, and obligation. The fact that adults have to make an effort to get into the "Christmas spirit" suggests that something has been lost, and the author believes that confronting this reality is the first step to understanding and addressing the problem. The author notes that children's unwavering faith and enthusiasm for Christmas is a testament to the fact that the holiday was once truly meaningful and exciting for adults as well.

Section section_02 (Chars 8421–12556):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has been lost among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who sought to uncover the truth about nature and human history. Their discoveries led to an age of skepticism, causing people to question and doubt long-held beliefs. As a result, faith and the qualities that come with it, such as enthusiasm and sentiment, have become devalued. However, the core principles of Christmas, including goodwill, charity, and dignity, remain intact and continue to resonate with people. Despite their doubts, people still try to keep the Christmas spirit alive, suggesting that it remains an essential part of their lives.
