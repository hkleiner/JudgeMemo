=== Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–7852):
Section Summary: The narrator's friend, George Corvick, asks him to write a review of Hugh Vereker's new novel for the periodical "The Middle". Corvick is unable to write the review himself as he has to rush to Paris to be with his friend Gwendolen Erme, whose mother is ill. The narrator writes the review, but later worries that it may not have done justice to Vereker's work, especially after Corvick implies that he should have delved deeper into the author's meaning. The narrator meets Vereker at a social gathering, but doesn't get a chance to discuss his review with him, although Lady Jane eventually brings it up and praises the narrator's writing. The narrator is relieved that Lady Jane has spoken up, as it saves him from having to awkwardly bring up the topic himself.

Section section_02 (Chars 7852–11221):
Section Summary: Lady Jane is excited to show a review of Hugh Vereker's work to him, and she has marked the passages that she particularly likes. When the author of the review reveals himself to Lady Jane, she seems less impressed, as if the article's value is diminished by the fact that it was written by someone she knows. At dinner, the author waits to see how Vereker will react to the review, but Vereker dismisses it as "the usual twaddle" when asked about it by another guest, Miss Poyle. Vereker's response surprises the author, who had expected him to be pleased by the praise. Vereker's comments suggest that he does not take the review seriously and may even find it superficial.
