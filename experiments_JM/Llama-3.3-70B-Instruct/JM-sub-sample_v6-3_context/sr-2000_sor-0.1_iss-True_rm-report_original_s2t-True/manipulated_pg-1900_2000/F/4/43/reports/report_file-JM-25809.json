Section section_01 (Chars 0–7779):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is sitting on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated with his lack of success in finding gold. He has received a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his unstable financial situation, and he is deeply hurt and enraged by her words. Despite his feelings, Jim is touched by Anne's affection and wishes they could be together, even without wealth. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's melancholy, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too broke and also influenced by the idea that Anne is always watching over him. Jim's situation is further complicated by his sense of responsibility and his desire to prove himself to Anne.
