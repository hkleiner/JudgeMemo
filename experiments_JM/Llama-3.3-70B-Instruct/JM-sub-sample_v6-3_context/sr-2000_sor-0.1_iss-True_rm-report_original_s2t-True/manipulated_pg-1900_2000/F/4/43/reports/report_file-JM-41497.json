Section section_02 (Chars 8751–12246):
Section Summary: Joshua Reynolds quickly gained success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and the patronage he received. As his career progressed, he moved to larger studios, raised his prices, and socialized with influential people, including Dr. Johnson, Burke, and Garrick. Reynolds was a man of many dimensions, revealing himself to be not only a talented artist but also an accomplished individual with a wide range of interests. However, he also had his flaws, including a touch of snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, which were somewhat refined through his associations with distinguished people.
