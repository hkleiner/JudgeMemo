Section section_01 (Chars 0–8356):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chin-t'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team encountered a village called Machuangtzu, inhabited by the Sarö Yögur people, who claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west over a thousand years ago. The Yögurs had a distinct language and culture, with some having amalgamated with the Chinese, while others retained their language and traditions. The village had a small, poorly used temple, where the lamas earned a living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and the villagers paid a yearly tax of thirteen horses to the Chinese government. The team spent time in the village, learning about the Yögurs' way of life and observing their customs, but were unable to gather much information about their early history or legends.

Section section_02 (Chars 8356–12747):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style homes with Buddhist altars and heated sleeping stoves. Their household items and clothing are largely of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences, and are often made from home-spun materials. The women's traditional head dresses are particularly distinctive, featuring long strips of cloth, copper rings, and metal ornaments. The Yögur people have limited clothing and no holiday attire, making it difficult for them to part with their belongings, even for sale. They do engage in some handicrafts, such as weaving, basket-making, and knitting, with the women producing cloth of good quality that is sold in local markets.
