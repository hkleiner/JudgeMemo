Section section_01 (Chars 0–8192):
Section Summary: By June 1864, the Civil War had been ongoing for over three years, with most of the fighting in the East taking place between Washington and Richmond. Despite numerous attempts, Union generals had failed to destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia or capture Richmond. In 1864, Union strategy shifted with the appointment of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who led a two-pronged attack against the Confederacy, with one arm targeting Richmond and Petersburg. The Army of the Potomac, led by Grant and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, engaged in a series of bloody battles against the Confederate Army, ultimately leading to a siege of Petersburg, a crucial transportation hub that supplied Richmond. The capture of Petersburg was seen as a key to ending the war, as it would cut off supplies to Richmond and likely lead to the city's abandonment.

Section section_02 (Chars 8193–12931):
Section Summary: Petersburg was a crucial transportation hub with several important roads and railroads connecting it to other cities, including Richmond, the Confederate capital. The city's railroads played a significant role in its importance, with tracks radiating in all directions, making it a major point of transfer for products and materials. To protect the city, a 10-mile long defense line, known as the "Dimmock Line," was constructed, featuring 55 artillery batteries and breastworks. However, the line's length and size proved to be a disadvantage, requiring more troops to defend it than were available. In June 1864, Union forces, led by General Grant, set their sights on Petersburg, with the XVIII Corps crossing the Appomattox River to launch an attack on the city, outnumbering the Confederate forces led by General Beauregard.
