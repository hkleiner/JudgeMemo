Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was known for his meticulous and realistic approach to art, as evident in his insistence on studying nature directly, even if it meant going to great lengths to do so. Born in 1815 in Lyons, Meissonier grew up in a time when French art was dominated by classic tradition, but he would later carve out his own niche with his unique style. His interest in art began at a young age, and despite his father's initial reservations, he eventually pursued a career in painting. Meissonier's early life was marked by a "hard struggle," but he persevered and went on to develop his skills, ultimately earning recognition for his work. His approach to art was characterized by a "devout and inflexible respect for reality," which guided his career and set him apart from other artists of his time.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–12899):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. During his time at Cogniet's studio, Meissonier developed his skills by drawing soldiers and horses in uniform, which sparked his interest in depicting the Napoleonic Era. Despite struggling financially, Meissonier shared his poverty with friends, including Daumier and Daubigny, and found ways to make a living, including decorating fans and creating illustrations for publishers. His big break came when he met the art-publisher Curmer, although initially, his work was rejected. Meissonier's persistence eventually paid off, and he began to gain recognition, with his first exhibited work, "A Visit to the Burgomaster," appearing in the Salon catalogue of 1834.
