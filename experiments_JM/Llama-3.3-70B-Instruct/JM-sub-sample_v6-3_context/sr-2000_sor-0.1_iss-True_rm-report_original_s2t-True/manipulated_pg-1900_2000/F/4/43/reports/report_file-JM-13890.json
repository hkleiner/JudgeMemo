Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear before him, and when he didn't, his shrine was destroyed and his name was erased from records. However, this didn't mark the end of pilgrimages to Canterbury, as a new wave of enthusiasm for the site emerged in the 20th century. Many modern pilgrims take the train to Canterbury, but those who walk the old Pilgrims' Way from Winchester are rewarded with a gradual unfolding of the city's story and a richer experience. The city of Canterbury has a long history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, which they called Durovernum, and later the Anglo-Saxons rebuilding the town and renaming it Cantwarabyrig. The city's strategic location at the junction of several Roman roads made it an important center, and it eventually became the capital of Kent under the reign of Ethelbert in 561.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–12766):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. Prior to 597, the Saxon capital was largely heathen, except for the king's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard, who were Christian. In 597, Augustine arrived and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct in Canterbury, leading to many conversions, including the king's own baptism. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city's St. Martin's Church, where Augustine and his monks began to preach, is considered one of the earliest Christian churches in England, with some believing it may date back to the Roman occupation.
