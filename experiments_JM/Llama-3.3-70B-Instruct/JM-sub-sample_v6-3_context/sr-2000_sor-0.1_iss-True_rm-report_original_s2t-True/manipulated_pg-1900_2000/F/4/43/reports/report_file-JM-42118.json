Section section_01 (Chars 0–7792):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born in 1732 in Grasse, a small town in southern France, to a glovemaker and his wife. The town was far removed from the fashionable and scandalous world of Paris, and Fragonard grew up surrounded by the natural beauty of the Provence region. As he grew older, he became aware of the gossip and news from Paris, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour as the king's mistress and her influence on the arts. However, Fragonard's own life took a different turn when his father apprenticed him to a notary, a career path that did not suit the young man's artistic inclinations. Eventually, his notary master recognized Fragonard's passion for art and advised that he be allowed to pursue his creative interests.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–12969):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, after reviewing the boy's sketches, advised him to train with Chardin to learn the mastery of his craft, but Fragonard made little progress and was eventually sent away. Undeterred, Fragonard continued to develop his skills by studying and painting masterpieces in Parisian churches from memory. He later returned to Boucher's studio and was accepted as a student, where he received ideal training by working on enlargements of Boucher's paintings for tapestries. Fragonard's talent eventually earned him a spot in the king's school and he went on to win the coveted Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols".
