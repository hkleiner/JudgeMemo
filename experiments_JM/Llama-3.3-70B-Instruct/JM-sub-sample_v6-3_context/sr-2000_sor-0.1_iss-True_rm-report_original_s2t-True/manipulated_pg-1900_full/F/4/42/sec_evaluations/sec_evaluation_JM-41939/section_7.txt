2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] abrupt shift from discussing the artist's health to her death
- [CLARITY] the sentence "And this innumerable cort√®ge that followed her bier testified more eloquently than any panegyric to the goodness of this admirable artist who had been able to lead a long and glorious career without creating a single enemy" is a bit long and complex
