1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] incorrect verb tense consistency ("he was led out, and I opened my book" followed by "I asked the doorkeeper to let me waited")
- [SPELLING] typo ("can only be explained by the fact that to a Frenchman time is nothing" should be "can only be explained by the fact that to a Frenchman, time is nothing")
- [SYNTAX] awkward sentence structure ("If I was forced to complain of an unnatural calm during my first two visits into the war zone I had my fill of noise and incessant motion on this trip")
- [LEXICON] informal language ("gay and grim" is an unusual phrase)
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] abrupt transition between paragraphs ("Once more I was summoned to the War Office..." seems unrelated to the previous paragraph)
- [STRUCTURE] lack of clear chronological order ("The next day I took my wrath to the War Office" is followed by a description of a trip that took place over several days)
- [CLARITY] unclear references ("the War Office" and "the American Clearing House" are not clearly explained)
- [TRANSITION] missing connections between ideas ("We started on the following Tuesday" seems to come out of nowhere)
