Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are structured as lists or have multiple dates and events, which can make them hard to follow.
- [LEXICON] The use of specific terminology like "electrotypes" and "Morris Golden face" may be unfamiliar to non-experts.
- [SYNTAX] Long paragraphs with multiple ideas and dates can disrupt the flow.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and aspects of Bradley's career without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of detailed descriptions of Bradley's work and awards may seem disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
- [CLARITY] The text assumes prior knowledge of the printing and design industry, which can make it difficult for readers without this background to understand.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
