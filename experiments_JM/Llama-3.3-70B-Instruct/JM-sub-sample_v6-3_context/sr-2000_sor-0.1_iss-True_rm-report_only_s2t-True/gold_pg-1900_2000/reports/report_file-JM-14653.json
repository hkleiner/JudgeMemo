Section section_01 (Chars 0–8421):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, filled with secrets, gift-giving, and feasting, but now it has become a time of gluttony, expensiveness, and forced enjoyment. The author believes that this change is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in the way people experience Christmas. Children still embody the true spirit of Christmas, with their faith and enthusiasm, but adults have lost some of this passion and sincerity. The author argues that acknowledging this change is necessary to understand and address the issue, rather than simply denying or ignoring it.

Section section_02 (Chars 8421–12556):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who promoted an age of doubt and skepticism. This movement led people to question and abandon long-held beliefs, resulting in a loss of faith and a devaluation of qualities like enthusiasm and sentiment. However, despite the changes brought about by science and philosophy, fundamental principles like dignity, mutual goodwill, and charity remain essential for human existence. Deep down, people recognize the importance of the Christmas spirit and strive to preserve it, even if they don't fully understand why. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit remains intact, and people's efforts to keep it alive reflect a profound instinct that they need it to navigate the challenges of life.
