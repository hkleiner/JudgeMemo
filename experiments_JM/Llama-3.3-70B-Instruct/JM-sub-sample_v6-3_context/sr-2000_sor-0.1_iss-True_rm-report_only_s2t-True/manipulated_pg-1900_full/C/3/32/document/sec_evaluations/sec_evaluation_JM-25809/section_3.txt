Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are structured in a way that may be considered archaic or less common in modern English.
- [LEXICON] Use of slang and colloquialisms (e.g., "wot's der matter", "yer've used me liker fren'") may hinder understanding for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Long, descriptive sentences may disrupt the flow for some readers.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the boy's outburst of anger and his sudden drop into sobbing might feel abrupt to some readers.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between dialogue and descriptive passages, which could potentially disrupt the flow for some readers.
- [CLARITY] Some characters' motivations (e.g., the woman's behavior towards the man) might not be immediately clear to all readers.
