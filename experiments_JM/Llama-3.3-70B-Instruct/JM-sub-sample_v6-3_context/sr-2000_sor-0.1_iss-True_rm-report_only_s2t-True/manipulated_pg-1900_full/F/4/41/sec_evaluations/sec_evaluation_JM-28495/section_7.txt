Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] multiple typos (e.g., "instrujent", "sgall", "unhurf", "bouleversement" is correctly spelled but may be unfamiliar to some readers, "kt" instead of "it", "lver" instead of "over", "mw" instead of "me", " Yas" instead of "Yes")
- [GRAMMAR] occasional awkward phrasing and sentence structure
- [LEXICON] some words may be less common or used in non-standard ways (e.g., "bouleversement")
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] some transitions between scenes or ideas could be smoother
- [STRUCTURE] the narrative jumps between different storylines and characters, which may cause minor confusion
- [CLARITY] a few sentences are wordy or contain multiple clauses, potentially reducing clarity
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
