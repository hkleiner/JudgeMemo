- [SYNTAX] occasional complex sentence structures that may hinder readability
- [LEXICON] some words may be less familiar to non-native speakers (e.g., "tabernacle", "imperishable", "animating principle")
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] occasional abrupt transitions between ideas
- [STRUCTURE] the text could benefit from clearer sectioning or paragraphing to guide the reader through the argument
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or contain multiple clauses, potentially reducing clarity
