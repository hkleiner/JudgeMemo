Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "what appeared to was" should be "what appeared to be"
- [SPELLING] "Youhad" should be "You had"
- [SYNTAX] "Does it really matter? You see, Chind, time actually stands still for us here. Duration is purely subjective, so what's your hurry?" feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the dialogue
- [LEXICON] "sans duration" might be unclear for some readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between Margot's thoughts about proto-man and the conversation about hyper-space feels a bit abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The switch between the Enterprise and the Dog Star scenes could be smoother
- [CLARITY] The explanation of hyper-space and its properties might be confusing for some readers
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
