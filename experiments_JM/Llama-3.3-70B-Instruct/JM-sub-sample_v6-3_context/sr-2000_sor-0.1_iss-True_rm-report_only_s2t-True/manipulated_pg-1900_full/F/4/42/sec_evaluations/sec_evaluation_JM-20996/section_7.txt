1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "instructed to started" should be "instructed to start"
* [GRAMMAR] "until he get there" should be "until he gets there"
* [SYNTAX] "Was uncertain but that" is an awkward phrase
* [LEXICON] "aforesaid pedagogues" is an unusual term
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the pursuit of ladrones to describing the sleep in the cart feels abrupt
* [CLARITY] The sentence "Was uncertain but that some of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops and would try the metal of our steel" is hard to follow
