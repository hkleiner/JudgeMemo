Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The zeal and enthusiasm of the band of missionaries began to brought" should be "began to bring"
- [LEXICON] Some words, such as "sultry", may be less familiar to non-native speakers
- [SYNTAX] A few sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the conversion of Ethelbert to describing the architecture of St. Martin's church
- [STRUCTURE] The text could be organized more chronologically, as it sometimes jumps back and forth in time
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain multiple clauses, which can make them difficult to understand
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
