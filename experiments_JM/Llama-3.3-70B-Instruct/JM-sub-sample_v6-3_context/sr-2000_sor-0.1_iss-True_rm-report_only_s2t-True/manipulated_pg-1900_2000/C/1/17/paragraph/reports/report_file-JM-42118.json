Section section_01 (Chars 0–7637):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. The town of Grasse was a quiet and isolated place, far removed from the fashionable and scandalous world of Paris. As a young boy, Fragonard was exposed to gossip and news of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour as the king's mistress and her influence on the arts. However, Fragonard's father had other plans for him, apprenticing him to a notary at the age of 15, but the boy's passion for art led him to idle and eventually pursue his creative interests. Fragonard's early life in Grasse and his introduction to the world of art set the stage for his future as a renowned painter.

Section section_02 (Chars 7637–12637):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to pursue a career in art. She introduced him to the renowned painter Boucher, who eventually took him under his wing after initial rejections from other artists, including Chardin. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's skills improved significantly, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." Fragonard then studied at the king's school and continued to work in Boucher's studio, producing notable works such as "Blind Man's Buff." During this time, he also came under the patronage of the Marquis de Marigny, the brother of the influential Madame Pompadour.
