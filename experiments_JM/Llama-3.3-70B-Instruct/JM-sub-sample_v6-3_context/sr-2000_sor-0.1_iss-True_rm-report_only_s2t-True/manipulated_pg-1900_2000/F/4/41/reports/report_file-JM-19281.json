Section Summary: In 2002, an open letter was addressed to the world's religious leaders, emphasizing the need for organized religion to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of God and religion.

Section section_02 (Chars 9774–14347):
Section Summary: The world is experiencing a resurgence of interest in religion and spirituality, driven in part by the recognition that religious belief is a key factor in promoting self-discipline and moral behavior. This spiritual search is manifesting in various ways, including a shift towards more personal and experiential forms of spirituality, as well as a growth in social movements focused on justice, peace, and environmentalism. The decline of materialism and the failure of ideologies that prioritized economic development above all else have contributed to this trend, as people seek a more meaningful and fulfilling way of life. As a result, traditional notions of reality and progress are being re-evaluated, and a more spiritual and values-based approach to life is emerging. This shift is expected to continue, driven by historical forces that are gathering momentum.
