The latter young man's enthusiasm and dedication led to his success, eventually becoming the head of a large consolidated high school. The author emphasizes the importance of personality, preparation, and experience in a teacher's success, with personality being a key factor in attracting and inspiring students.

Section section_02 (Chars 8908–12264):
Section Summary: A teacher should make a good impression, both personally and professionally, when applying for a position.

When applying for a job, teachers should be careful and thorough in filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A teacher's motivation for applying for a position should be based on a desire to grow professionally, rather than just seeking a higher salary.
