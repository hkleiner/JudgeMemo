Section section_01 (Chars 0–8721):
Section Summary: Russia played a crucial role in World War I, suffering enormous sacrifices, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and over 30 times those of the United States. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, diverting enemy forces and giving the Allies time to prepare and counterattack. Russia's efforts weakened the enemy's resources, making it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat them. The author argues that Germany was close to winning the war, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Russia's contributions to the war effort were significant, and its sacrifices paved the way for the Allied victory.

Section section_02 (Chars 8721–13137):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, relied on concentrating all forces against France, but this was thwarted when Russia unexpectedly attacked East Prussia, diverting German troops. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and gave France a crucial advantage, ultimately changing the course of the war. Russia's early efforts played a significant role in the war, as they bore the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's contributions are often overlooked due to the circumstances that developed towards the end of the war. General Ludendorf's memoirs have also contributed to this oversight, as they attempt to discredit Russia's sacrifices and distort the historic perspective of the war.
