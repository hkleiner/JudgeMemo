Section section_02 (Chars 8843–12746):
Section Summary: Millet's art is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more lighthearted scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and solitude of peasant life, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen," which conveys the loneliness and hardship of rural labor. His art reflects his philosophical nature, and he is more accurately described as a philosopher than a painter. Through his work, Millet revealed a profound understanding of the human experience, particularly the simple, everyday struggles of the common people.
