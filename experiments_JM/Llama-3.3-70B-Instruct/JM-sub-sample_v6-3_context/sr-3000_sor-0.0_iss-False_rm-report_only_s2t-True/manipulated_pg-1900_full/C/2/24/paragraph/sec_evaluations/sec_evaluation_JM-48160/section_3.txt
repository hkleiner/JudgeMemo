Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "The entire company was waited" should be "The entire company was being waited on"
* [LEXICON] Some words, such as "viscous" to describe flies, may be less common and affect readability
* [SYNTAX] A few sentences are long and convoluted, potentially disrupting the flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events and locations, which can be disorienting
* [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs or ideas feel abrupt
* [CLARITY] A few sections, such as the description of the hospitals, feel somewhat disconnected from the rest of the narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
