Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the replacement of brick on outside walls, new window frames and panes with new lumber added supporting the antiquated structure" is a long and awkwardly phrased sentence
- [LEXICON] use of "hallowed ground" may be overly formal or less common in modern writing
- [SYNTAX] sentence structure could be improved for better flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the transition from discussing the rebuilding project to calling for its completion as a club center and museum feels somewhat abrupt
- [TRANSITION] the text jumps from describing the current state of the project to a call for action without a clear connection
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
