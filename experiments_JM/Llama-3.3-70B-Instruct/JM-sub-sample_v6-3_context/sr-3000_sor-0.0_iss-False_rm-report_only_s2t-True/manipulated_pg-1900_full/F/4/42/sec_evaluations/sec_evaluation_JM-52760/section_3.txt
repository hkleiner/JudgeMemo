Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "had learn" should be "had learned"
* [GRAMMAR] "a plan of battle had am evolved" is grammatically incorrect
* [GRAMMAR] "the lot of the Northern soldiers is rapidly becoming" should be "the lot of the Northern soldiers was rapidly becoming"
* [GRAMMAR] "Many men had chosen to run the gantlet of fire back to their own lines, but others remained clinging to the protective sides of the crater" is a long sentence and could be broken up for better fluency
* [SPELLING] "am" is used instead of "was" or "had" in several places
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from describing the Battle of the Crater to discussing the campaign to capture Petersburg
* [STRUCTURE] The text could be organized into clearer sections or paragraphs to improve coherence
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow
* [TRANSITION] The transition between the description of the Battle of the Crater and the discussion of the Weldon Railroad could be smoother
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
