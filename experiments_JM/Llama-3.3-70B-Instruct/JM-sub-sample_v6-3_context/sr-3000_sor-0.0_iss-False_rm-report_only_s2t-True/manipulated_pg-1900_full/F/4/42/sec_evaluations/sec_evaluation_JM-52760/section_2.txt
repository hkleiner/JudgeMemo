Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "am taking" should be "were taking" or "were making"
* [GRAMMAR] "the number of Union troops south of the river was increasing hourly, until by midnight of June 16 at least 70,000 have crossed" should be "had crossed"
* [GRAMMAR] "the days am numbered" should be "the days are numbered"
* [LEXICON] Some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better clarity
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from describing the battle to discussing the Union's plan to encircle Petersburg
* [STRUCTURE] The chapter divisions seem arbitrary and could be improved for better flow
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
