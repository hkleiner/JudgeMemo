Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "could had paint" should be "could have painted"
- [GRAMMAR] "collaborated" should be "to collaborate"
- [GRAMMAR] "choose" should be "chosen"
- [GRAMMAR] "painted ease and luxury" is an awkward phrase
- [SPELLING] "indefatigable" is correctly spelled but "incomparable" is used multiple times, which may indicate a lack of varied vocabulary
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the anecdote about Veronese painting for the Pisani family and the description of the Ducal Palace decoration feels abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics, such as Veronese's life, his works, and the decoration of various buildings, without a clear connection between them
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
