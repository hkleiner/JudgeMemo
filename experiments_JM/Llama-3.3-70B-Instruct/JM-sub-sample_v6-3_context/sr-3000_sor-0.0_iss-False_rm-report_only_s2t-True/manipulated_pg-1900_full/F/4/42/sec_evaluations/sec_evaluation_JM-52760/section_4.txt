Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "He succeed" should be "He succeeded"
* [SPELLING] "principel" is not present but "pick" and "shovel" are used correctly, however "respective" is used correctly, but "principle" is not present, a small typo "penetrated" instead of "piercing" or "penetrating" 
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the Battle of Peebles' Farm to describing the daily life of soldiers
* [STRUCTURE] The text could be organized more chronologically, with clearer transitions between sections
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making them hard to understand
