Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "seems to had" should be "seems to have"
* [SPELLING] "succour" is a less common spelling, "succor" is more commonly used in American English
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
* [LEXICON] Some words, such as "rococo", may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Millet's art to his early life
* [STRUCTURE] The chapter headings ("MILLET'S EARLY LIFE", "THE MIGRATION TO PARIS") seem to indicate a shift in topic, but the text does not always follow a clear chronological or thematic structure
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs contain multiple, loosely connected ideas, making it hard to discern the main point
* [TRANSITION] The text could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs and ideas
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
