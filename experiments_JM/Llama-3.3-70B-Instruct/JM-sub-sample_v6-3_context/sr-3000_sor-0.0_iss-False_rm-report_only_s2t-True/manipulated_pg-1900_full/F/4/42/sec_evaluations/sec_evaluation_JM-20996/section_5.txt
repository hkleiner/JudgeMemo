Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the driver was instructed to started"
* [GRAMMAR] "we at first agreed that neither of us should go to sleep, but it was later decided" could be more smoothly connected
* [SPELLING] "ladrones" may be unfamiliar to some readers, but it's a correct term
* [SYNTAX] "and not to stop until he get there" should be "and not to stop until he gets there"
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between the decision to sleep and the description of the sleep could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the sleep to the arrival at the village
* [CLARITY] The purpose of procuring ponies is not explicitly stated
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
