Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "No traveler who lands at Honolulu will felt unrequited" should be "No traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited"
* [GRAMMAR] "the women wore a sort of low-necked body with great wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the same size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belt or tied, but just drawn tightly around the waist" is a long, awkward sentence
* [SPELLING] "wonted" is an uncommon word, but correctly used; however, some readers might find it distracting
* [LEXICON] "silvery hair little indicated the probability of such a blunder" is a bit unclear
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from describing the departure from San Francisco to the arrival in Honolulu without much connection
* [TRANSITION] The transition between the description of the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology could be smoother
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow, such as the description of the women's clothing
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
