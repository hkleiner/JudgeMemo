Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the artist would enjoyed" should be "the artist would have enjoyed"
* [LEXICON] "prostrated her suddenly" could be rephrased for better clarity
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the artist's painting to her death could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas (the painting, the death, the funeral) without clear connections
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
