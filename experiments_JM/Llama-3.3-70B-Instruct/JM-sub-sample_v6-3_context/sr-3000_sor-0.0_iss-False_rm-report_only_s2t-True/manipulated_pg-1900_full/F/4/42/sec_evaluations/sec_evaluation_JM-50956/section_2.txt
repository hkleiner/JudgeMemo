Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues:

* [LEXICON] Some sentences are wordy and use complex vocabulary
* [SYNTAX] A few sentences have awkward phrasing
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions
* [STRUCTURE] The chapters seem to be loosely connected, with some repetition of ideas
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs are dense and difficult to follow
* [TRANSITION] The text could benefit from clearer connections between paragraphs and chapters
