Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [SPELLING] "fortunenturns" should be "fortune turns"
* [GRAMMAR] sentence structure is poetic but slightly awkward
* [LEXICON] "overbeating temples" is an unusual phrase
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [CLARITY] the text assumes prior knowledge of the subject's context
* [TRANSITION] the shift from "love them till I die" to "perhaps if fortune turns" feels somewhat abrupt
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
