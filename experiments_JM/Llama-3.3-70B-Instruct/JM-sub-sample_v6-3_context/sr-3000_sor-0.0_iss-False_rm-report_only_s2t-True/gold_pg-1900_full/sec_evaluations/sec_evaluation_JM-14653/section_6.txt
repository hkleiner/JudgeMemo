Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the Feast of St. Friend" seems incorrect, likely referring to "the Feast of St. Francis" or another saint, but most commonly "St. Nicholas" or simply "Christmas"
* [LEXICON] "intercourse" has a somewhat archaic or formal connotation
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The connection between Christmas and a "plan of campaign" for "less imperfect intercourse" is unclear
* [CLARITY] The phrase "renewed effort" lacks specific context
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
