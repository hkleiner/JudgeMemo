Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "use that advantage well" should be "used that advantage well"
- [SPELLING] "quivered and broke into a sob" is a bit awkwardly phrased
- [SYNTAX] "The ball which had gone through Shirtliffe’s hand had found a resting place in the old man’s breast" is a long sentence
- [LEXICON] "the young Englishman’s heart" is a bit unclear, as Morley is not explicitly stated to be English
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between Robert's conversation with Mason and Morley's departure is a bit abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The story jumps between different scenes and characters without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it hard to follow the plot
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
