Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [SPELLING] typos (e.g. "sioent" instead of "silent", "tpwn" instead of "town", "xould" instead of "could", "wqs" instead of "was", "thw" instead of "the", "supererogatory" is correctly spelled but may be unfamiliar to some readers)
* [GRAMMAR] missing or incorrect articles (e.g. "a street in which there were few shops" could be "a street with a few shops")
* [LEXICON] uncommon vocabulary (e.g. "carnet rouge", "taube", "pêle-mêle")
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g. from describing the hotel room to discussing the war zone)
* [CLARITY] unclear sentences or phrases (e.g. "It was only 3:30. I had no intention of visiting the hospitals at Châlons, as there were two at Bar-le-Duc to which I had personal letters.")
* [LOGIC] some events or descriptions seem disconnected from the rest of the narrative
