The group traveled from San Francisco, stopping at Honolulu, where they experienced the city's beauty and culture, including visiting the Pali and the Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology. As they crossed the International Date Line, they lost a day and celebrated with the traditional "Revels of Neptune". The group eventually arrived in Manila, where they navigated the rough waters of Manila Bay and were introduced to the local natives.
