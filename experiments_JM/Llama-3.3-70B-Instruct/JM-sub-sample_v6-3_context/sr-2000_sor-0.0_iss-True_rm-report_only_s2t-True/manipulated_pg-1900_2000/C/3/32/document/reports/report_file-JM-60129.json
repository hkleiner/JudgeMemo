Section section_01 (Chars 0–8346):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team soon encountered the Sarö Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu, where they met three women who proudly identified themselves as Sarö Yögurs, a name that distinguishes them from the Tangutans. The villagers, also known as Huang Fantzu or "yellow barbarians," have a legend that their forefathers came from a city in the west over a thousand years ago. The team stayed in the village temple, where they met the lamas, who earn their living by keeping cattle and cutting wood, and learned about the local administration and tax system. The Sarö Yögurs have a unique language and culture, but their history and traditions are not well-documented, and they were hesitant to share their stories with the expedition team.

Section section_02 (Chars 8346–12737):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people's homes feature traditional Chinese elements, such as the k'ang sleeping stove and Buddhist altars, with some Mongolian influences. Their clothing is mostly made from home-spun materials and follows Chinese and Mongolian styles, with men and women wearing similar attire, including long coats, trousers, and fur coats. The women's head dresses are particularly distinctive, adorned with coral, glass beads, and copper rings, and are only worn by married women. The Sarö Yögur people have limited clothing and few possessions, making it difficult for them to replace items they sell, and their handicrafts are limited to weaving, basket-making, and knitting. Their woven cloth is of good quality and is one of the few saleable items they possess, often sold in local markets.
