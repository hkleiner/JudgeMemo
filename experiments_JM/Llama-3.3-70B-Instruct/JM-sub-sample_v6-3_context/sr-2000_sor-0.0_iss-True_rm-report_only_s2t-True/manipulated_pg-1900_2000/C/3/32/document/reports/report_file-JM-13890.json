Section section_01 (Chars 0–8523):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear and answer charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, a new wave of pilgrims has emerged, traveling to Canterbury to visit the site of the shrine, with many taking the train, but missing out on the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement, Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Roman occupation, the city was abandoned and later rebuilt by the Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many pilgrims visiting to experience its beauty and historic landmarks.

Section section_02 (Chars 8524–12697):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. Prior to 597, the Saxon capital was largely heathen, except for the influence of Ethelbert's Frankish wife Bertha and her chaplain Bishop Luidhard. In 597, Augustine arrived and began to preach and instruct the people, with Ethelbert providing him with quarters in Canterbury and allowing him to preach at the old church of St. Martin. As a result, many converts were made, and Ethelbert himself was baptized, leading to the Christianization of England and establishing Canterbury as the headquarters of the Christian Church. The city of Canterbury has maintained its importance in the Christian Church for over 1,300 years, and its association with ecclesiastical control is likely to continue even if the State Church ceases to exist.
