Section section_01 (Chars 0–8870):
Section Summary: The author participated in a historic movement, sending 499 trained men and women to establish a system of free public schools in the Philippine Islands on July 23, 1901. This event marked an epoch in world history, as a conquering people sent educators instead of soldiers to a conquered land. The group traveled from San Francisco to Manila, stopping in Honolulu, where they experienced the city's natural beauty and unique cultural practices. Along the way, they crossed the International Date Line, resulting in the loss of a day, and eventually arrived in Manila, where they were introduced to the local culture and customs. The author describes the challenging landing in Manila Bay and the group's initial impressions of the city and its people.
