Section section_01 (Chars 0–8426):
Section Summary: The expedition began on December 13th, 1907, in the Chinese town of Chint'a, and headed southeast into the Gobi Desert. The team passed through a sandy and sterile stretch of ground, eventually reaching the village of Machuangtzu, home to the Sarö Yögur people, also known as the "yellow Yögurs". The villagers claimed to have originated from a city called Shiche-Hache in the west, over a thousand years ago, and had settled in their current location to escape a contagious disease. The team was welcomed by the lamas at the village temple, who were hospitable and talkative, and learned about the local administration, economy, and culture of the Sarö Yögur people. The village was found to be relatively clean and well-built, with the lamas playing a significant role in the community, educating boys for the priestly office and earning a living through cattle-keeping and wood-cutting.

Section section_02 (Chars 8427–12850):
Section Summary: The Sarö Yögur people live in traditional Chinese-style houses with Buddhist altars and heated sleeping stoves. Their household utensils and clothing are mostly of Chinese origin, with some Mongolian influences, and are often made from home-spun materials. The women's traditional head dress is particularly distinctive, featuring copper rings, coral, and glass beads, and is worn from marriage until death. The Yögur people have limited handicrafts, with women weaving cloth and men making baskets and knitting stockings using primitive techniques. Their woven cloth is one of their few saleable items, which they sell in nearby markets, highlighting their simple and self-sufficient way of life.
