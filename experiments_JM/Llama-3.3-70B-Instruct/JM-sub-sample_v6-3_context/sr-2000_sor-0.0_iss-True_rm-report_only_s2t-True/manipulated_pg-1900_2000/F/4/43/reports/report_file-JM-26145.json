Section section_01 (Chars 0–8551):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1888, a number of clay tablets were found near the ruins of Tell el Amarna. The tablets, written in Babylonian cuneiform, were part of the Egyptian state archives during the reigns of Kings Amenophis III and IV, and consisted mainly of letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The discovery revealed that the Semitic speech of Babylon was used as the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The Egyptian court and administration during this period were marked by a shift from a warlike spirit to a more peaceful and indulgent atmosphere under King Amenophis III, who reigned for 36 years. His son, Amenophis IV, attempted to reform the Egyptian religion, introducing a form of monotheism that worshipped the sun disk, symbol of the god Ra.

Section section_02 (Chars 8551–12794):
Section Summary: The life of King Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, is not well understood, but it is believed that he intended to reform the Egyptian religion and reduce the power of the priests of Amon in Thebes. He introduced a new doctrine, known as "the doctrine," which emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, or Aten, and led to a break with the old religion. The king and his officials, including those in Syria and Palestine, began to use new names and titles that reflected their allegiance to Aten, and a new capital city, Akhet-Aten, was built to serve as the center of the new religion. The Aten dogma represented a shift towards monotheism and was based on natural phenomena, but its impact on Egyptian society is not fully understood. The king rewarded his officials who accepted the new doctrine, and they played important roles in the administration of Egypt and its territories.
