Section section_01 (Chars 0–8256):
Section Summary: The narrator and his wife, Stella, are on a tram heading to Battersea to visit the Home for Lost Dogs, where they plan to buy a dog for five shillings. They had previously considered buying a purebred dog, but decided against it due to the high cost. After arriving in Battersea, they try to find the Home for Lost Dogs, but their attempts at getting directions are thwarted, including a humorous encounter with a mischievous street boy. They then spot a man wearing a uniform with the Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs emblem and decide to follow him discreetly, hoping he will lead them to their destination. However, their attempts at surreptitious tracking prove to be challenging and comical.
