Section section_01 (Chars 0–8447):
Section Summary: Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, a French painter, was born in 1815 in Lyons. He is known for his meticulous and realistic style, which is exemplified by an anecdote where he arranged for a squadron of cuirassiers to ride through a field of grain so he could study the scene from nature. Meissonier's early life was marked by a struggle to pursue his artistic passion, despite his father's initial disapproval and attempts to steer him towards a more practical career. He was largely self-taught, having begun drawing at a young age with his mother's old paint-box, and his talent was evident even in his childhood. Meissonier's artistic approach was characterized by a devotion to reality and a commitment to accuracy, which would become a hallmark of his career.

Section section_02 (Chars 8447–12899):
Section Summary: Meissonier, a young artist, overcame his father's opposition to pursue his passion for art, studying under Julien Petier and later Léon Cogniet. During his time at Cogniet's studio, Meissonier was inspired by the Napoleonic Epic and developed a desire to depict it in his art. However, he struggled financially, living on a small allowance and sharing his poverty with friends, including Daumier and Daubigny. Meissonier's early career involved decorating fans, creating religious figures, and exhibiting his work, including his first exhibition at the Salon in 1834. He eventually gained recognition from editors and art publishers, including Curmer, after initially facing rejection, which marked the beginning of his successful career as an artist.
