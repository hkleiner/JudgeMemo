Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "have cleared" should be "had cleared"
* [GRAMMAR] "wish" should be "wished"
* [GRAMMAR] "Shoulded" is not a word, likely meant "Should"
* [GRAMMAR] "who were unable to locate the positions they have been ordered to capture" is a bit unclear
* [SPELLING] "ad libitum" might be unfamiliar to some readers, but it's not an error
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between the description of the battle and the introduction of the next chapter could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from describing the Battle of Fort Stedman to introducing the next chapter, "FIVE FORKS: BEGINNING OF THE END"
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
