Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "him to stood" should be "him to stand"
- [GRAMMAR] "mighted" is not a word, likely meant "might"
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
- [LEXICON] "staccato breaths" may not be the best choice of words for the context
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the baby's first steps and the father's visit feels abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and events without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the text are unclear or confusing, such as the description of Fuh Tang's illness
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
