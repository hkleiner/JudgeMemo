Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the driver was instructed to started"
* [GRAMMAR] "we at first agreed that neither of us should go to sleep, but it was later decided" could be more smoothly connected
* [SPELLING] "aforesaid pedagogues" is an unusual term and may cause confusion
* [SYNTAX] "Was uncertain but that some of the ladrones would learn of our having left the body of troops" is a bit awkwardly phrased
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the pursuit of ladrones to the scene of riding in the cart is somewhat abrupt
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps quickly from the decision to sleep to waking up with the sun past the midday mark
* [CLARITY] The purpose of procuring ponies at the village is not entirely clear
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
