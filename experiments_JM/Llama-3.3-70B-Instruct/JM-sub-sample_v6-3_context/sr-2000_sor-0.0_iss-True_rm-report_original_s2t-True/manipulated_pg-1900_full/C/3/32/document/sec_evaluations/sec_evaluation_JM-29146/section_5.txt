Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] Missing articles in some places
* [LEXICON] Unfamiliar terms like "expanduffle" and "Sirian-archaic" might confuse some readers
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or structured in a way that slightly disrupts the flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The sudden introduction of the "proto-man" myth and its connection to hyper-space feels somewhat abrupt
* [STRUCTURE] The transition from Ramsey's conversation with the Vegan girl to the reading of the letter feels a bit disconnected
* [CLARITY] Some parts of the letter, especially the scientific explanations, might be hard to follow for readers without background knowledge
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
