Section section_01 (Chars 0–7792):
Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker and his wife. Growing up in a picturesque and romantic setting, Fragonard was inspired by the beauty of his surroundings, which would later influence his art. As he grew older, he was aware of the gossip and scandals of the French court, including the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who became a powerful figure in the arts. However, Fragonard's own life took a different turn when his father apprenticed him to a notary, a path that did not suit the young man's artistic inclinations. Eventually, his notary master recognized Fragonard's passion for art and advised that he be allowed to pursue his creative interests.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–12969):
Section Summary: In 1748, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher, who was at the height of his career. Boucher, impressed by the boy's potential but aware of his lack of skill, advised him to train with Chardin, a master of still-life painting. However, Fragonard made little progress under Chardin and was eventually sent away, after which he honed his skills by copying masterpieces from memory. He later returned to Boucher, who took him under his wing, and Fragonard went on to win the prestigious Prix de Rome at the age of 20. Under Boucher's guidance and later as a student at the king's school, Fragonard developed his skills and produced notable works, including "Blind Man's Buff".
