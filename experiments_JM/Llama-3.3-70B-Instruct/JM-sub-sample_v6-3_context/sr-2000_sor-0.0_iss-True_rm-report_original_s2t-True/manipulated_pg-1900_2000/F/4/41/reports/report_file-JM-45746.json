Section section_02 (Chars 8908–12264):
Section Summary: A teacher should make a good impression, both personally and professionally, when applying for a position. To be successful, a teacher needs a strong general education and should specialize in their chosen field, while also continuing to broaden their knowledge. When applying for a job, teachers should be careful and thorough in filling out application blanks and choose responsible references who can speak to their qualifications. A teacher's motivation for applying for a position should be based on a desire to grow professionally, rather than just seeking a higher salary. By being prepared, professional, and motivated, a teacher can increase their chances of success in their career.
