Section section_01 (Chars 0–8375):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Ancient Egypt were discovered in Middle Egypt, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, finding extensive ruins and a well-preserved city plan. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform, which were later secured by the government and distributed to museums in Britain, Egypt, and Germany. The tablets, part of the Egyptian state archives, revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. and contained letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings to the Egyptian monarch. The letters provided insight into the administration and court of the Egyptian kings, Amenophis III and IV, who ruled during a time of relative peace and focused on building projects, art, and spirituality rather than war. The discovery of the tablets and their contents shed new light on the history and culture of Ancient Egypt and the Ancient East.

Section section_02 (Chars 8376–12900):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, also known as Akhenaten, introduced a new monotheistic religion in Egypt, worshiping the sun disk, or Aten, as the chief deity. He attempted to reform the traditional Egyptian religion, but faced resistance from the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes, leading to open strife and the relocation of the royal court to Tell el Amarna. The new capital was named Akhet-Aten, and officials who accepted the new doctrine, known as "the doctrine," were rewarded and held important positions. The queen-mother, Teye, showed respect for her son's opinions and visited the new capital, while officials who accepted the new religion were given prominent roles in the government and foreign affairs. The Aten dogma represented a significant shift in religious thought, emphasizing natural phenomena over mythology, and was characterized by a more spontaneous and devout expression of feeling.
