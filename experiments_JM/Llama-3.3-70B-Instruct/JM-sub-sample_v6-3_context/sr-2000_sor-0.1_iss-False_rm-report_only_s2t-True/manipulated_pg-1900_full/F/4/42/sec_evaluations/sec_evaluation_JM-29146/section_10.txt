Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "But look at Garr Symm." should be followed by a verb, or the sentence is a fragment.
- [SPELLING] "Ramar Chind" is likely a typo, as the character's name is "Ramsey" throughout the text.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased, disrupting the flow.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The story jumps abruptly from action to philosophical discussions without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between different ideas and plot threads without a clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts, such as the "equation of doom," are not fully explained, leaving the reader confused.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
