Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "a large proportion of this regiment was make up of onetime coal miners" should be "a large proportion of this regiment was made up of former coal miners"
- [LEXICON] some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better clarity
- [SYNTAX] a few sentences have complex structures that may hinder smooth reading
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing the failure to capture Petersburg to describing the Union's plan to encircle the city
- [STRUCTURE] the chapter headings ("CHAPTER: FIRST UNION ATTEMPT TO ENCIRCLE PETERSBURG", "CHAPTER: BATTLE OF THE CRATER", "CHAPTER: CONFEDERATE LINE") disrupt the flow of the narrative
- [TRANSITION] some paragraphs lack clear connections to the preceding or following paragraphs
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
