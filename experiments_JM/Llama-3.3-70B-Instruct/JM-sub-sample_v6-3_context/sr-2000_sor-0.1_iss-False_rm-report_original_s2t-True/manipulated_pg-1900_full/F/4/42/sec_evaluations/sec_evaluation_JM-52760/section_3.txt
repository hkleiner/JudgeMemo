Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "a large proportion of this regiment was make up" should be "was made up"
- [LEXICON] some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better flow
- [SYNTAX] a few sentences have complex structures that may hinder readability
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing the failure to capture Petersburg to describing the Union's plan to encircle the city
- [STRUCTURE] the chapter headings ("CHAPTER: FIRST UNION ATTEMPT TO ENCIRCLE PETERSBURG", "CHAPTER: BATTLE OF THE CRATER", "CHAPTER: CONFEDERATE LINE") disrupt the flow of the narrative
- [CLARITY] some paragraphs lack clear topic sentences or transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
