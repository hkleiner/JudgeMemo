Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "instructed to started" should be "instructed to start"
* [GRAMMAR] "and not to stop until he get there" should be "and not to stop until he gets there"
* [GRAMMAR] "Was uncertain" should be "We were uncertain"
* [SYNTAX] "we at first agreed that neither of us should go to sleep, but it was later decided" is a bit awkwardly phrased
* [SPELLING] "aforesaid" is a less common word, but used correctly
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the danger of ladrones to deciding to sleep could be smoother
* [CLARITY] The sentence "probably the driver had no greater desire to cross the Styx than his passengers have" is a bit unclear
* [TRANSITION] The shift from sleeping to waking up and seeing the "blazing tropic sun" could be more cohesive
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
