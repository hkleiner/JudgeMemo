* [SYNTAX] some sentences are wordy and hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] the transition between the discussion of Napkhuria's reform and the description of Mitani's situation feels abrupt
* [STRUCTURE] the text jumps between different topics, such as the political situation in Syria and the history of Mitani
* [CLARITY] some sentences are unclear or confusing, making it hard to understand the author's point
