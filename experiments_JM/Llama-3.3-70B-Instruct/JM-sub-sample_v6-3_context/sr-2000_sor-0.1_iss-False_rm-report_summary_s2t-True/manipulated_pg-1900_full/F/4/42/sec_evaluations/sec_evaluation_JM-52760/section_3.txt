Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "a large proportion of this regiment was make up of onetime coal miners" should be "a large proportion of this regiment was made up of former coal miners"
- [SYNTAX] some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better flow
- [LEXICON] occasional use of outdated or technical terms without explanation
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing the failure to capture Petersburg to describing the plan to encircle the city
- [STRUCTURE] the chapter headings and subheadings could be more clearly defined to separate different ideas and events
- [CLARITY] some sections are dense with dates and events, making it difficult to follow the narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
