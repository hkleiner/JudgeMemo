Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the light engine into which it have charge" should be "the light engine into which it had charge"
- [GRAMMAR] "the reeling engine of the express left the rails and staggered drunkenly along the ballast. A moment later it turn over" should be "the reeling engine of the express left the rails and staggered drunkenly along the ballast. A moment later it turned over"
- [GRAMMAR] "His left arm is badly burned" should be "His left arm was badly burned"
- [LEXICON] "bouleversement" is an uncommon word that may cause difficulty for some readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the train accident to the scene with Lord Caversham and the curate, with little transition
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain multiple clauses, making them hard to follow
- [LOGIC] The story relies on coincidences, such as Lord Caversham encountering the curate and Excalibur again, which may seem implausible
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
