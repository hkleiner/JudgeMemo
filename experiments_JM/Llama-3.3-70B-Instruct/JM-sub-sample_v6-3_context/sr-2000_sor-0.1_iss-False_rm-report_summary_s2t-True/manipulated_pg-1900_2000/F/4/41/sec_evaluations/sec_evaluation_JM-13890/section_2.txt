Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [SPELLING] typos (e.g. "arode" instead of "arose", "tje" instead of "the", "ths" instead of "this", "tjere" instead of "there", "vcease" instead of "cease", "Cahterbury" instead of "Canterbury")
* [GRAMMAR] minor grammatical errors (e.g. "had extended his power so far beyond the confines of Kent that he had authority as far north as the Humber" could be rephrased for better clarity)
* [LEXICON] occasional awkward word choices (e.g. "sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church")
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] some sentences seem disconnected from the main narrative (e.g. the discussion of the Church of England's history and its potential future)
* [TRANSITION] abrupt shifts between different ideas (e.g. from describing Ethelbert's power to discussing the Christianization of England)
* [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or unclear (e.g. the final sentence about St. Martin's church)
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
