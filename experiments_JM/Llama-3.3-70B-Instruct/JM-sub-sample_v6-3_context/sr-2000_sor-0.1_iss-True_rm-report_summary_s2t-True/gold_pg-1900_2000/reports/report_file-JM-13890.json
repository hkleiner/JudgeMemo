Section section_01 (Chars 0–8579):
Section Summary: In 1538, King Henry VIII issued a writ summoning Thomas Becket, the long-dead Archbishop of Canterbury, to appear on charges of treason, resulting in the destruction of his shrine and the erasure of his name from records. Despite this, the site of the shrine has seen a new wave of enthusiasm, with many modern pilgrims visiting Canterbury, although some take the train and miss the scenic approach to the city. The city of Canterbury has a rich history dating back to the Palaeolithic Age, with the Romans establishing a settlement there, known as Durovernum, which became an important center for trade and commerce. After the Romans abandoned Britain, the city was rebuilt by the Anglo-Saxons, who renamed it Cantwarabyrig, or the city of the men of Kent. The city's history and significance are still celebrated today, with many visitors making the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, a testament to the enduring appeal of the site.

Section section_02 (Chars 8580–12766):
Section Summary: Ethelbert, the king of Kent, had extended his power beyond Kent and had authority as far north as the Humber. In 597, Augustine arrived in England and was allowed by Ethelbert to preach and instruct in Canterbury, where he began to convert the Saxons to Christianity. With the influence of Queen Bertha and her chaplain, Bishop Luidhard, Augustine's mission was successful, and Ethelbert himself was baptized, leading to the rapid Christianization of England. Canterbury became the headquarters of the Christian Church in England, a position it has held for over 1,300 years. The city's St. Martin's Church, where Augustine and his monks preached, is considered one of the oldest Christian churches in England, with its origins possibly dating back to the Roman or Saxon period.
