Section Summary: The introduction to Will Bradley's chap book highlights his significant impact on American graphic arts, bringing a fresh and modern style to a field that was previously stagnant. Bradley's work was influenced by European artists, but he developed a unique and indigenous American style that was bold, free, and exuberant. The chapter "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming" tells the story of Bradley's childhood, growing up in Massachusetts and later moving to Northern Michigan with his mother. Bradley's early interest in art and printing was encouraged by his father, who was a cartoonist, and he spent much of his childhood drawing and experimenting with printing presses. Bradley's determination to become an artist was evident from a young age, and he eventually found success in his career, paving the way for future generations of graphic artists.
