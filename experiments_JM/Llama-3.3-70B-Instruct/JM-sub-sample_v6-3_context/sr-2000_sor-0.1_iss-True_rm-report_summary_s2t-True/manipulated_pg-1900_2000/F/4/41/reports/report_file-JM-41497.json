Section section_02 (Chars 8536–12246):
Section Summary: After returning from a holiday, Sir Joshua Reynolds opened a studio in St. Martin's Street, which quickly led to success as a portrait painter due to the quality of his work and patronage from Lord Edgcumbe. As his career progressed, he moved to larger studios, raising his prices, but his popularity remained unchanged. Unlike many artists, Reynolds was not only a skilled painter but also a man of the world, with a wide range of interests and friendships with notable figures such as Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and Burke. Despite having some human weaknesses, including snobbery, jealousy, and vulgarity, Reynolds was able to learn and grow from his associations with refined and intelligent people. Overall, Reynolds' life and personality are more interesting and nuanced when seen in their entirety, rather than being judged solely on his moral character.
