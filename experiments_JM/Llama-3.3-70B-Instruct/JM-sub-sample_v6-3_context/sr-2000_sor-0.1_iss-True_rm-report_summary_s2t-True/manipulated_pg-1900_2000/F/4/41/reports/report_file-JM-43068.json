Section section_02 (Chars 8763–12746):
Section Summary: Jean-François Millet's artistic style is characterized by restraint, as he prioritized conveying his message over showcasing his technical skills. When he attempted to depict more joyful scenes, such as in "La Baigneuse," his work lacked the depth and emotion that defined his more somber pieces. Millet's true strength lay in his ability to capture the struggles and loneliness of rural life, as seen in works like "The Sheep Pen," which conveys the isolation and hardship of a shepherd's daily life. As a philosopher-artist, Millet's work reflects his deep understanding of the human experience and the struggles of the common people. His art is a testament to his observation of and empathy for the simple, everyday lives of peasants and laborers.
