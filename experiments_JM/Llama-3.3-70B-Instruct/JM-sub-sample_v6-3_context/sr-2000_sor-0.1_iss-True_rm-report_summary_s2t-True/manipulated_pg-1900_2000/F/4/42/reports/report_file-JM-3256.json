Section section_01 (Chars 0–8149):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author shares anecdotes to illustrate this point, including a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary education, instinctively recognized the classics of English literature. In contrast, some people may claim to be bookmen due to their wealth or social status, but lack a genuine love for reading and literature. Ultimately, the author suggests that a true bookman is one who can distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless, meaningful works of literature.

Section section_02 (Chars 8149–11584):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and have a lasting impact. A true book lover, or "bookman," can distinguish between these two types of books and appreciates those that have a classic quality, enriching the human mind and speaking to all ages. According to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, a classic book is one that has wisdom, a unique style, and transcends the limitations of its time. A bookman's taste is eclectic and not limited by subject matter, and they value books that have a timeless quality, such as the works of Bunyan, Milton, and A'Kempis. Ultimately, a bookman seeks to collect and cherish books that are like cathedrals, providing inspiration and peace for generations to come.
