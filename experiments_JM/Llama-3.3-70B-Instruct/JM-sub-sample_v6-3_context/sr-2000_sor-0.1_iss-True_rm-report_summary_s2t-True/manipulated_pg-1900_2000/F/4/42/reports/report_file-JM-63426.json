Section section_02 (Chars 8377–12029):
Section Summary: The narrator, a young boy, is sent home from school for not having the correct answer to an arithmetic problem and instead asks his mother if he can go to work to earn money to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. He starts working at the Iron Agitator newspaper office, washing and feeding the press, and eventually learns the trade from an itinerant job printer. As he gains experience, his wages increase, and he becomes responsible for setting jobs, advertising, and presswork. The narrator faces challenges, including a poorly heated workspace and frequent power failures, but he perseveres and eventually becomes a skilled job printer, earning a man's wages by the time he is 15. He works under the guidance of George A. Newett, the owner and editor of the Iron Agitator, and later Iron Ore, newspaper.
