Section Summary: Jean François Millet is considered one of the greatest painters of peasant life, alongside artists like Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Adrian van Ostade. Millet's work is characterized by its incisive truth and sincerity, capturing the everyday life of simple peasants with a profound and sympathetic rendering. His paintings, such as those depicting the angelus, convey the struggles and hardships of rural life, as well as the importance of religion in providing comfort and solace. Millet's unique style, developed through his simple and earnest life, is marked by subtleties of line and tone that reflect the atmospheric effects of the French countryside. His work is a testament to the enduring power of art to convey meaningful messages and emotions, and its appreciation requires a deep understanding of the country and landscape he depicted.

Section section_02 (Chars 8839–13972):
Section Summary: The section begins by mentioning a systematic program of translation and publication that has made Bahá’u’lláh's writings accessible to people worldwide in over 800 languages. However, the majority of the section focuses on the life and work of artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, discussing his friendships, weaknesses, and artistic style. In contrast, the section also describes the work of Jean-François Millet, a philosopher-painter who depicted the everyday life of peasants with simplicity and depth. Millet's paintings, such as "The Sheep Pen," convey the loneliness and hardship of rural labor, showcasing his unique perspective on the human experience. Overall, the section explores the lives and artistic visions of these two distinct individuals, Reynolds and Millet.
