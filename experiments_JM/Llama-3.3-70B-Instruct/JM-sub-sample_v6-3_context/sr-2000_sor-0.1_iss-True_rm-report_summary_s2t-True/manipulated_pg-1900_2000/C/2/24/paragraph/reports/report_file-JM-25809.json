Section section_01 (Chars 0–7851):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, is sitting on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated despite the beautiful surroundings. He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. He reads a letter from his sweetheart, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, which further adds to his despair. Jim's friend, Bud, the mail-carrier, arrives and tries to cheer him up, suggesting he take a break and go to town to have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling too down and also mindful of Anne's expectations. Jim is deeply in love with Anne and hopes to one day be able to provide for her and make her happy.
