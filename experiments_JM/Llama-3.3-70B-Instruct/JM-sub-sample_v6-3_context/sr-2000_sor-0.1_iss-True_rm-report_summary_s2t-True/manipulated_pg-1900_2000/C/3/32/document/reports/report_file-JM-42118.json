Section Summary: Jean Honoré Fragonard was born on April 5, 1732, in the town of Grasse, France, to a glovemaker. Growing up in a picturesque region surrounded by olive trees and colorful flowers, Fragonard developed a love for beauty and creativity. As he grew older, he became aware of the artistic and political developments in Paris, including the influence of François Boucher and the rise of Madame de Pompadour, who was a patron of the arts. Despite his father's initial plans for him to become a notary, Fragonard's passion for art led him to pursue a different path. He eventually gained permission to follow his artistic bent, setting him on a course to become a renowned painter.

Section section_02 (Chars 7758–12929):
Section Summary: In 1750, the year of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, a 16-year-old boy, later known as Fragonard, traveled to Paris with his mother to meet the famous painter Boucher. Boucher, impressed by the boy's potential, advised him to train with Chardin to learn the basics of painting, but Fragonard made little progress and was sent away. After six months of studying on his own, Fragonard returned to Boucher and was taken on as a student, working on large decorative cartoons and learning valuable skills. Under Boucher's guidance, Fragonard's talent flourished, and he went on to win the Prix de Rome at the age of 20 with his painting "Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols." Fragonard continued to work with Boucher and later with Carle Van Loo, producing notable works such as "Blind Man's Buff" during his time at the king's school.
