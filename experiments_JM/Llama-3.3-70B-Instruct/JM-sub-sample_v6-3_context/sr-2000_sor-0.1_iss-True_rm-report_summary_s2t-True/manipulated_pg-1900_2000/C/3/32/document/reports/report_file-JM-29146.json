Section section_01 (Chars 0–8003):
Section Summary: Jason Ramsey, an Earthman and pilot for Interstellar Transfer Service, is informed by the Port Security Officer on Irwadi that the government has "planetarized" the Irwadi Transfer Service, effectively grounding all non-Irwadian pilots. Ramsey is forced to surrender his pilot license and is told that the Centaurian ship he was scheduled to pilot, the Polaris, is also grounded. The Irwadian government has taken this step to monopolize the transfer of titanium, a vital metal used in interstellar ships, and will only allow Irwadian pilots to transport it. Ramsey is left to find a way to support himself until the Interstellar Transfer Service can intervene, and he has a few hundred credits to tide him over. The move is expected to give Irwadi control over the titanium trade and allow them to set their own prices.

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–16069):
Section Summary: Chind Ramar, the Irwadi Security Officer, has ordered the crew and passengers of the Polaris to assemble, announcing that the planet has been "planetarized" and all outworld ships are stranded indefinitely. This means that only Irwadian pilots will be allowed to transport titanium, a vital metal, through hyper-space, giving Irwadi control over the market. Jason Ramsey, a hyper-space pilot, is among those affected and has surrendered his pilot license, but he's not too concerned as he has some savings to tide him over. An Earthgirl, who has the ability to read minds, has also left the ship and is heading to the Old Quarter of Irwadi City, trying not to panic. Ramsey meets with fellow pilot Stu Englander, who is struggling financially and worried about supporting his family, and they discuss their uncertain futures on the planet.

Section Summary: Jase Ramsey visits his friend Englander, who is struggling to make ends meet, and gives him 375 credits to support his family.

After leaving Englander's place, Ramsey goes to a gambling hall, where he loses most of his money and is left with only three credits. A drunk and arrogant Irwadian, wearing flashy jewelry, confronts Ramsey, accusing him of being a trouble-making outworlder who is depressing the standard of living on Irwadi. The Irwadian tells Ramsey to leave the gambling hall, and the atmosphere becomes tense and silent.
