Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] abrupt sentence transition with "A biosensor activated with a pulse."
- [LEXICON] potentially outdated or less common vocabulary (e.g., "exigencies", "virility of execution", "undulous")
- [SYNTAX] complex sentence structures may hinder smooth reading
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] abrupt introduction of "A biosensor activated with a pulse" seems unrelated to the context
- [STRUCTURE] the text jumps between different topics (Rosa Bonheur's life, her painting, her friend's health) without clear connections
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or contain multiple ideas, potentially causing confusion
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
