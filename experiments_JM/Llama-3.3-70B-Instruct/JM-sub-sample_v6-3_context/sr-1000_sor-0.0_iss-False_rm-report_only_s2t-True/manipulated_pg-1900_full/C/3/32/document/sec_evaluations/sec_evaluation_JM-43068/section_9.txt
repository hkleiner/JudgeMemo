Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "a thing. Ono" appears to be a sentence fragment or incomplete thought
* [SPELLING] "stuff" likely should be "staff" in the context of the Cherbourg visit
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are lengthy and contain multiple clauses, potentially disrupting flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between Millet's visit to Cherbourg and his meeting his first wife feels abrupt
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and aspects of Millet's life without clear connections
* [CLARITY] The purpose and outcome of Millet's portrait of the deceased mayor are not entirely clear
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
