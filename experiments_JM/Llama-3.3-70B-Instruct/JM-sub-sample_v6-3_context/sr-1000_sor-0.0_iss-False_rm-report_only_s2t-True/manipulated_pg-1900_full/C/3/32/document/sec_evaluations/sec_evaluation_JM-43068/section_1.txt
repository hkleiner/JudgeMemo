Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "a long interval elapsed betwixt the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of the stuff" should be "a long interval elapsed between the death of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet"
- [LEXICON] "in the stuff and Flanders" is unclear, possibly should be "in Flanders"
- [SYNTAX] some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] the text jumps abruptly from discussing Brueghel to discussing Millet
- [TRANSITION] the connection between the discussion of the Dutch masters and Millet's work could be smoother
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy and unclear, making it hard to understand the author's point
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
