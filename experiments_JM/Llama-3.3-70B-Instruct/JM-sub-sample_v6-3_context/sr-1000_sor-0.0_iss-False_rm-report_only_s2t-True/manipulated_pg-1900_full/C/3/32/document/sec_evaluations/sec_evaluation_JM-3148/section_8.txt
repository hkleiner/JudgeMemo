- [SYNTAX] Long, winding sentences can make it difficult to follow the narrative
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Aunt Hitty's thoughts and external events without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some sections, such as the description of the coffin-plates, feel tangential to the main plot
- [LOGIC] The character's motivations and backstory are not fully explained, potentially confusing readers
