Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are structured in a way that feels slightly archaic or less common in modern English.
- [LEXICON] Use of less familiar vocabulary, such as "faggots of incense" and "hem of the Goddessâ€™ robe," may cause minor difficulties for some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences may require re-reading for full comprehension.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time frames and ideas without clear transitions at times.
- [CLARITY] Some sections assume background knowledge of Chinese customs and traditions that not all readers may possess.
- [LOGIC] The flow of events and character developments is generally logical, but some scenes feel somewhat disconnected from the main storyline.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
