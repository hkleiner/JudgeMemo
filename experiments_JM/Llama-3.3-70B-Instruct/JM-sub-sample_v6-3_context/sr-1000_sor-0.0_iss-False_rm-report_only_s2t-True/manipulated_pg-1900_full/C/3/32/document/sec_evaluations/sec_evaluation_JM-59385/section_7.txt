Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Some sentences are structured in a way that feels slightly archaic or less common in modern English.
- [LEXICON] Use of less familiar vocabulary, such as "hutung" and "mandarin robe," might slow down reading for some audiences.
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences may impede smooth reading for some readers.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Kuei Ping's introspection and external events without clear transitions at times.
- [CLARITY] Some passages, especially those describing Kuei Ping's emotions and thoughts, can be vague or open to interpretation.
- [LOGIC] The sudden change in Fuh Tang's decision to stay, attributed to "The orders of an Emperor," feels somewhat abrupt and unexplained.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
