Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "o'er" is an archaic or poetic way of saying "over", may cause confusion
* [SPELLING] "antagonist" is correctly spelled, but "clinched" should be "clenched"
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
* [LEXICON] Word choice is mostly formal and old-fashioned, which may affect readability
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The story jumps abruptly from a fight scene to a dying man's confession
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative switches between different characters' perspectives without clear transitions
* [CLARITY] Some parts of the dialogue are unclear or hard to understand due to the old-fashioned language
* [TRANSITION] The chapter ends abruptly, without resolving the situation or providing a clear connection to the next chapter
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
