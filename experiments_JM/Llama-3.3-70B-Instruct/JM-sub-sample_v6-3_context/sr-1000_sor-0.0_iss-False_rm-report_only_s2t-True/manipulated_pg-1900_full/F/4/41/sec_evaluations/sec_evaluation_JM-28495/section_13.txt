Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [SPELLING] multiple spelling errors (e.g., "hoir", "instrujent", "sgall", "unhurf", "bouleversement" is correctly spelled but seems out of place, "lver" instead of "over", "kt" instead of "it", "Mokr" instead of "Moor", "yardx" instead of "yards", "altogerher" instead of "altogether", "tehder" instead of "tender")
* [GRAMMAR] occasional grammatical errors or awkward phrasing (e.g., "to the grave inconvenience of the inhabitants of Pimlico, and refusing to be comforted" could be smoother)
* [LEXICON] some words may be less common or used in unexpected ways (e.g., "bouleversement")
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [STRUCTURE] the narrative jumps abruptly from describing the curate's chase to the coroner's jury and then to the train accident without clear connections
* [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references (e.g., "In all this Excalibur was the instrujent of Destiny, as you sgall hear" is cryptic without context)
* [TRANSITION] transitions between scenes or ideas could be smoother (e.g., the shift from the accident to the aftermath)
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
