Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "surrendefed" instead of "surrendered"
- [GRAMMAR] "uniting with Johnston in North Carolina" could be rephrased for better clarity
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Lee's surrender to the fall of all Confederate forces by early June 1865
- [CLARITY] Lack of explicit connection between the surrender of Lee's army and the subsequent surrender of General Johnston
