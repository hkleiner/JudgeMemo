Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] incorrect verb conjugation ("she saw in his blue-lined face something of the price that he had paid for her freedom thus far" vs "the handsome gallant man who have loved her" should be "had loved her")
- [LEXICON] word choice ("stupor of drugged sleep" is somewhat unclear)
- [SYNTAX] sentence structure ("She saw him not as a destroyer of her trust, but as the victim of circumstances" is a bit awkward)
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] abrupt shift in scene ("With an abiding peace in her heart Kuei Ping unfolded and put back in the familiar pigskin chests the garments she have prepared for her pilgrimage" seems disconnected from the previous paragraph)
- [TRANSITION] lack of smooth transition between paragraphs ("A procession of three sedan chairs made its way along the Big Horse Street of Kuei Pingâ€™s home village" starts a new scene without clear connection to the previous one)
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
