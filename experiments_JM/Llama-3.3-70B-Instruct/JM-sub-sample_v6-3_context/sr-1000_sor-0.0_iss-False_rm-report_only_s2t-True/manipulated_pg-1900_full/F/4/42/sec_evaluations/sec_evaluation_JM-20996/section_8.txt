Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "In less than a week he had employ" should be "In less than a week he had employed"
- [SPELLING] "pina" should be "pi√±a" or "pine" for clarity, but assuming "pina" is a typo for a type of fabric or garment, it's unclear without context
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between discussing Filipino dress and then moving into house-keeping in the Philippines feels abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics, such as descriptions of clothing, house-keeping, and life in Manila, without a clear connecting thread
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain unclear references, making the text hard to understand in places
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
