Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Blue-clad pickets were silence" should be "Blue-clad pickets were silenced"
- [SPELLING] "vicious crossfire and many Confederates preferred surrender to withdrawal" is a long sentence and could be broken up for better flow
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for easier reading
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the description of the battle and the introduction of the chapter title "FIVE FORKS: BEGINNING OF THE END" feels abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different parts of the battle without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are confusing due to the large number of proper nouns and locations
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
