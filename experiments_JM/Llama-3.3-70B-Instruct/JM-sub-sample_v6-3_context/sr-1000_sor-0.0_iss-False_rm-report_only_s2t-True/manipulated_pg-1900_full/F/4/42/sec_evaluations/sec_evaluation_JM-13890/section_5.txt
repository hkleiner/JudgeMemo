Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "a fire begin" should be "a fire began"
* [SPELLING] "reroofed" might be a less common word, but it's correct; however, "devastate" should be "devastated"
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Canute's actions to the Norman Conquest
* [TRANSITION] The transition between the discussion of the Saxon cathedral and the Norman cathedral could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The text seems to lack a clear chronological structure in some parts
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
