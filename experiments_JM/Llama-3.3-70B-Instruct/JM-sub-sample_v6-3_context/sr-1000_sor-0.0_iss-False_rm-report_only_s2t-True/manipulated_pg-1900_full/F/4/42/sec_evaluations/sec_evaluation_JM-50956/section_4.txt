Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "It may was" should be "It may have been"
* [GRAMMAR] "he, at the same time, credits Rennenkampf with three times the number he actually had" is wordy and unclear
* [SPELLING] "sonov" is likely a typo and should be "war"
* [LEXICON] Some sentences are wordy and use complex vocabulary
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Ludendorf's statement to discussing the Russian defeat
* [STRUCTURE] The text could be organized more clearly, with better transitions between paragraphs
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and confusing, making it hard to follow the author's argument
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
