Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the artist would enjoyed" should be "the artist would have enjoyed"
- [LEXICON] "prostrated" might be less common, potentially affecting readability for some audiences
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the artist's success to her death could be smoother
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of the artist's life and death without a clear connecting thread
