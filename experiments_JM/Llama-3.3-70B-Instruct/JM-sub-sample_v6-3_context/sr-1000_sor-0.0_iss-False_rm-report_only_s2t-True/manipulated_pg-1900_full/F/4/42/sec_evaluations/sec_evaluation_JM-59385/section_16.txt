Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "a part to was used" should be "a part was used"
- [LEXICON] "luminate" is not the best choice of word, consider "enlighten" or "inspire"
- [SYNTAX] some sentences are wordy and could be simplified for better flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] the narrative jumps abruptly from Kuei Ping's story to the narrator's experience
- [TRANSITION] the connection between the two parts of the story is not clearly explained
- [CLARITY] some sentences are vague or open-ended, making it hard to understand the author's intent
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
