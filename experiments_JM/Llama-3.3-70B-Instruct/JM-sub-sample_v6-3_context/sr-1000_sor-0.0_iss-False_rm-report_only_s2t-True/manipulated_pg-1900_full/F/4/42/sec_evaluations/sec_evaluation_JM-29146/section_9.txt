Evaluation Form:

- [SPELLING] None notable
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted
- [LEXICON] Word choice is generally good, but some terms like "hyper-space" might be unfamiliar to non-science fiction readers
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The concept of proto-man and hyper-space is not clearly explained
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between the father's letter and Ramsey's thoughts without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] Some parts of the text are confusing, such as the idea of proto-man leaving hyper-space
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the father's letter to Ramsey's thoughts and then to the scene with the Vegan girl is abrupt
