Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "there is one thing more to did" should be "there is one thing more to do"
* [SPELLING] "meant" should be "means"
* [SYNTAX] "The rich voice fall with a sad cadence" should be "The rich voice fell with a sad cadence"
* [LEXICON] "piteously" is a less common word, but it's not an error
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between the scene where Robert is talking to Washington and the scene where he is beating the drum alone could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The chapter title "CHAPTER VIII. - ANOTHER MESSAGE FOR DEBBY" seems out of place in the middle of the text
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
