Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "woulded have delighted" should be "would have delighted"
* [SPELLING] "was a dense early morning fog but what actually was an artificially produced fog" is a long sentence and could be broken up for better flow
* [SYNTAX] "Youhad got to be" should be "You've got to be"
* [LEXICON] Some sentences are wordy or use complex vocabulary that may disrupt the flow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The story jumps abruptly from Margot's thoughts to the technicians working on the Dog Star
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative switches between different characters and plotlines without clear transitions
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or confusing, such as "What would happened within the next several hours, he realized, might be beyond his ken"
* [TRANSITION] The story moves quickly from one scene to another without smooth transitions
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
