1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "He stand" should be "He stood"

- [GRAMMAR] "She have proved" should be "She had proved"
- [GRAMMAR] "Her loins am covered" should be "Her loins are covered"
- [GRAMMAR] "which had not yet taken over the outworlds" is a bit awkwardly phrased
- [SPELLING] "abrevitog" might be a typo or non-standard term
2) Coherence Issues:

- [CLARITY] The story assumes some background knowledge of the characters and their world, which might confuse readers without context
- [STRUCTURE] The pacing of the dialogue and action could be more balanced
