- [SYNTAX] Long paragraphs with multiple ideas can make the text feel dense
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from discussing the French people's situation to focusing on Du Barry's character
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different topics (e.g., the intellectuals, Du Barry, Fragonard) without clear connections
