- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of pronouns and nouns, such as "a thing" and "the stuff", which seem to be placeholders for actual names or titles.
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "a thing" and "the stuff" which disrupts the flow of reading.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are structured in a way that makes them hard to follow or understand.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between different time periods and events.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between the life of Fragonard and the historical context of the French Revolution without a clear connection.
