Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] missing or incorrect articles
- [SPELLING] typos (e.g., "ij" instead of "in", "gurgle" might be a typo, "slumgullion" is a rare word but seems correct in context)
- [SYNTAX] some sentences are wordy or awkwardly phrased
- [LEXICON] occasional use of obscure vocabulary (e.g., "slumgullion", "gulch")
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] some transitions between ideas feel abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] the narrative jumps between Jim's thoughts, his environment, and the letter from Anne
- [CLARITY] a few sentences are hard to follow due to complexity or word choice
- [TRANSITION] the shift from Jim's misery to Bud's arrival feels a bit sudden
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
