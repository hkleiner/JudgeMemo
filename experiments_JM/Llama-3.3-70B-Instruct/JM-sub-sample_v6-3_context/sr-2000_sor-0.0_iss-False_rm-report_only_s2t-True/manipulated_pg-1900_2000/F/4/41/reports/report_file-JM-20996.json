Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • missing or incorrect articles

        • typos (e.g. "yhe" instead of "the", "seoected" instead of "selected", "nkon" instead of "noon", "laternour" instead of "later on", "qs" instead of "as", "plaij" instead of "plain", "moungain" instead of "mountain", "ovwr" instead of "over", "beheaded before this grim-faced old idol" is a sentence fragment)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • word choice (e.g. "silvery hair little indicated the probability of such a blunder" is wordy)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • sentence structure (e.g. "The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will prove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with great movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of personal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples" is a long, convoluted sentence)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • abrupt transitions between ideas (e.g. the shift from describing the departure from San Francisco to the description of the Hawaiian Islands)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • lack of clear organization (e.g. the text jumps between different topics, such as the movement, the journey, and the description of the Philippine Islands)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • unclear or confusing sentences (e.g. "It was on this day that the United States Government sent from San Francisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to establish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public schools" is a long, complex sentence)
