Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "the shadows was long" should be "the shadows were long"
* [GRAMMAR] "mighted" is not a word, likely meant "might"
* [GRAMMAR] "as she could went" should be "as she could go"
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [TRANSITION] The shift from the jewel shop to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school feels abrupt
* [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps back and forth in time without clear transitions
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or unclear, making it hard to understand the plot
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
