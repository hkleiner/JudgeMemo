Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "made up their minds" should be "made up their minds" but "the little girls to made up their minds" is incorrect, it should be "the little girls to make up their minds"
* [GRAMMAR] "which just melts in one's mouth" is a sentence fragment
* [SPELLING] "mighted" is not a word, it should be "might"
* [GRAMMAR] "disappear" should be "disappeared"
* [GRAMMAR] "stowed his small tourists away" is an unusual phrase
* [GRAMMAR] "took care of him" should be "would take care of him"
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between the visit to Edinburgh and the trip to Abbotsford could be smoother
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from describing the monument to Grey Friars Bobby to the trip to Abbotsford
* [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy and could be broken up for better clarity
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
