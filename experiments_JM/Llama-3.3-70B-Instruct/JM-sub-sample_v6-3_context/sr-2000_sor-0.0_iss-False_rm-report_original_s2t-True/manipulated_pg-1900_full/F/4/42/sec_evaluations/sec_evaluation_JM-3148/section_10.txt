- [GRAMMAR] "Davy did not quite understand this, though he thought it pretty; but Lyddy’s husband do" should be "Davy did not quite understand this, though he thought it pretty; but Lyddy’s husband did"
- [SPELLING] "innumerable pockets in a square basket that she held in her lap" is a long sentence and could be broken up for better readability

- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from describing Anthony's music composition to Lyddy sewing and then to Davy reading
- [TRANSITION] The connection between some paragraphs could be smoother
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are wordy or contain complex metaphors that may confuse the reader
