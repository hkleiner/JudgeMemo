Section section_01 (Chars 0–8726):
Section Summary: Russia played a significant role in World War I, suffering enormous losses, including 12 million casualties and 3 million deaths, which was more than twice the losses of France and many times those of England and America. Despite being unprepared for a modern war, Russia's early offensives helped to frustrate Germany's plans, and its continued efforts over three years weakened the enemy and made it possible for the Allies to ultimately defeat them. Russia's contributions were crucial in preventing Germany from winning the war, as Germany's plan to quickly defeat France was thwarted by Russia's diversion of German and Austrian forces. The author argues that Germany was close to victory, but the combined efforts of France and Russia prevented this outcome. Overall, Russia's sacrifices and military efforts were instrumental in the Allied victory, and its role in the war should not be underestimated.

Section section_02 (Chars 8726–13144):
Section Summary: The German military plan, led by Moltke, relied on concentrating all forces against France, but this was thwarted when Russia launched a surprise attack on East Prussia, diverting German troops. This self-sacrificing move by Russia destroyed the German plan and gave France a crucial advantage, ultimately changing the course of the war. Russia's early efforts played a significant role in the war, as they bore the brunt of the fighting alongside France during the first few years. However, Russia's contributions are often overlooked due to the circumstances that developed towards the end of the war. General Ludendorf's memoirs have also contributed to this oversight, as they contain false and misleading information about Russia's role in the war.
