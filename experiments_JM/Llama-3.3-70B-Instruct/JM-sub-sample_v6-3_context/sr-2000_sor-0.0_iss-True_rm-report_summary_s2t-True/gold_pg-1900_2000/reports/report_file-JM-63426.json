Section section_02 (Chars 8375–12036):
Section Summary: The narrator, a young boy, is expelled from school for not knowing an arithmetic answer and instead goes to work at the Iron Agitator newspaper office, owned by George A. Newett. He starts by washing the press and learning to feed it, earning three dollars a week, which later increases to six dollars. As he gains experience, he takes on more responsibilities, including setting jobs and operating the press, and his wages increase accordingly. The narrator eventually leaves the Iron Agitator for a competing newspaper, the Peninsula Record, for a higher wage, but later returns to the Iron Agitator, where he becomes a job printer and eventually a foreman, earning a man's wages by the time he is 15. The narrator's time at the Iron Agitator is marked by hard work, learning, and exposure to the challenges of small-town life, including traveling fakers who try to swindle local merchants.
