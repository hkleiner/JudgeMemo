Section Summary: The story begins with the introduction of the Street of Precious Pearls, a significant location in Chinese culture where dowry jewels are bought for brides.

At a shop owned by Wong Lui, a reputable dealer in jewels, they are greeted with formal courtesy and offered a selection of precious stones, including pearls, which Madame Yen and Kuei Ping prefer. As they carefully select the jewels, a bargaining process ensues between Madame Yen and Wong Lui, with each trying to negotiate the best price.

Section section_02 (Chars 8455–12108):
Section Summary: Kuei Ping cherished a memory of her last day at school, where she had a heartfelt conversation with her American teacher, Miss Porter, in the garden. Miss Porter had inspired Kuei Ping with the idea of freedom and equal opportunity, and had encouraged her to pursue her dreams in the United States. However, Kuei Ping knew that her family had already planned her marriage and expected her to fulfill her traditional duties. She had made the difficult decision to prioritize her family's expectations over her own desires, and had kept her feelings hidden, even from Miss Porter. The memory of this conversation and the silver honor medal she received remained precious to Kuei Ping, a symbol of the freedom and aspirations she had to set aside.
