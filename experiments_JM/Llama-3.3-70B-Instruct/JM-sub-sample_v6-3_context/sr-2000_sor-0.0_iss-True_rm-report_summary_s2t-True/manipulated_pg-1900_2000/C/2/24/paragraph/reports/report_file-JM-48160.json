=== Evaluation Report ===

Section section_01 (Chars 0–8299):
Section Summary: The author describes France as being divided into two sections: one where people can move freely and the other, the war zone, which is heavily restricted. The author, determined to visit the front lines, faces numerous challenges and rejections in obtaining the necessary permissions. With the help of a duchess and a Vice-President of a charity, the author eventually receives a "carnet rouge" allowing her to visit certain areas, but not the front lines as she had hoped. She is instead permitted to visit Meaux, where she witnesses the impressive and somber sight of the battlefield of the Marne, with its many graves and cemeteries. The author's goal of reaching the front lines, particularly Amiens, remains unfulfilled due to the ongoing battle of the Somme and the Grand Quartier Générale's refusal to grant permission.

Section section_02 (Chars 8300–11649):
Section Summary: The village of Barcy was heavily damaged during the war, with the church and several houses reduced to ruins. The Mayor and his family took shelter in their cellar for six days, listening to constant shellfire overhead. The narrator was later granted permission to visit Châlons, Vitry, and Bar-le-Duc, and was given a letter of introduction to facilitate their trip. They traveled to these destinations, observing many soldiers at the train station and on military trains, and were struck by the height and confidence of the French officers they met. The narrator was eager to experience the reality of war firsthand, having been sheltered in Paris for three months.
