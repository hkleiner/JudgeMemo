Section section_01 (Chars 0–8637):
Section Summary: In 1820, the remains of a great city in Middle Egypt were discovered, and in 1842-45, a Prussian expedition explored the site, now known as Tell el Amarna. In 1888, fellahin digging for marl stumbled upon clay tablets with writing in Babylonian cuneiform, which were later secured by the government and found to be part of the Egyptian state archives from the time of Kings Amenophis III and IV. The tablets, mostly letters from Egyptian officials and Asiatic kings, revealed that Babylonian was the language of diplomacy in the East around 1400 B.C. The two Pharaohs of the Tell el Amarna Period, Amenophis III and IV, belonged to the XVIIIth Dynasty, which had freed Egypt from Asiatic invaders and expanded its kingdom through conquests. Amenophis IV introduced a reform of the Egyptian religion, moving towards a form of monotheism that worshipped the sun disk, a significant departure from the traditions of his warlike ancestors.

Section section_02 (Chars 8638–12741):
Section Summary: Pharaoh Amenophis IV, later known as Akhenaten, initially intended to introduce reforms gradually, but the resistance from the powerful priests of Amon led him to take more aggressive measures. He introduced a new doctrine, "the doctrine," which emphasized the worship of the Sun's Disk, "Aten," and sought to weaken the influence of the Theban hierarchy. The pharaoh built a new capital, Akhet-Aten, and officials who accepted the new doctrine were rewarded, with some receiving high honors and important positions. The new doctrine was seen as heretical, as it was based on natural phenomena rather than mythology, and its impact on religious thought is evident in the hymns found in the tombs. The pharaoh's reforms and new doctrine had significant effects on the royal court and the administration of Egypt, with officials who accepted the new doctrine holding important positions and influencing the governance of the kingdom.
