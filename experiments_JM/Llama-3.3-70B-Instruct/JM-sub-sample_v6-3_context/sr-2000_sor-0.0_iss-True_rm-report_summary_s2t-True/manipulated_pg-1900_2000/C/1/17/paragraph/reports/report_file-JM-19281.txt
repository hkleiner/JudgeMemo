Section Summary: In 2002, an open letter was addressed to the world's religious leaders, emphasizing the need for organized religion to rise above fixed conceptions and recognize the oneness of God and religion. The letter, which was widely distributed, called for a fundamental change in the way people of different faiths relate to one another and was met with a generally positive response. The current period in history is seen as receptive to efforts to spread the message of unity and spiritual awakening, as a sea change in human consciousness is underway.

Section section_02 (Chars 9578–13566):
Section Summary: The world is experiencing a resurgence of interest in spirituality and religion, with people seeking meaning and connection beyond material existence. This phenomenon is driven by the failure of materialism and the realization that economic development and social improvement are not enough to fulfill the human spirit. The collapse of totalitarian regimes and the limitations of modernization schemes have led to a re-evaluation of values and a search for new sources of meaning. As a result, people are exploring various spiritual and philosophical traditions, including New Age movements and alternative forms of spirituality. This shift is seen as a positive development, as people seek to transcend the limitations of a purely materialistic worldview.
