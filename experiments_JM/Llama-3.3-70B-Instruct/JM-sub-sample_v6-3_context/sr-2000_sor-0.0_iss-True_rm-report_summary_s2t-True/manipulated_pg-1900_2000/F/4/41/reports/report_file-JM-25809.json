Section section_01 (Chars 0–7779):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, sits on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated despite the beautiful surroundings. He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. He reads a letter from his lover, Anne, who has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability, and he is deeply hurt and enraged. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, and Bud offers him advice to take a break and have some fun, but Jim declines, feeling that he is being watched by Anne's eye and is too proud to accept help. Jim's situation is further complicated by his refusal to accept Bud's offer of financial help, citing his inability to pay him back.

Section section_02 (Chars 7780–10812):
Section Summary: Bud tries to give Jim some money, but Jim refuses, and instead, Bud offers him a horse to ride to Plattsburg, a town 50 miles away. However, Jim declines and asks Bud to catch him a burro from a nearby herd instead. Bud agrees and returns with a burro, which Jim mounts and prepares to ride. Before they part ways, Bud tells Jim about being held up by a humpbacked man who tried to steal the mail, but Bud chased him off and gave him $10. The two friends then ride together to the fork in the trail, where they will likely separate.
