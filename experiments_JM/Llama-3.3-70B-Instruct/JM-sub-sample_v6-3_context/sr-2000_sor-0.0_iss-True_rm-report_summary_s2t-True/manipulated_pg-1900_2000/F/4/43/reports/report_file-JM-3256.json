Section section_01 (Chars 0–8144):
Section Summary: The author distinguishes between a book owner and a bookman, emphasizing that having many books does not necessarily make one a bookman. A true bookman is born with a passion for reading and a deep appreciation for literature, rather than simply collecting books for their monetary value or prestige. The author illustrates this point through anecdotes, including a visit to a wealthy man's library, where the books are kept behind glass doors, and a story about a colonial squatter who, despite his lack of literary training, instinctively recognizes the classics of English literature. The author argues that a bookman can appreciate both light and serious reading, and that the ability to distinguish between fleeting popular novels and timeless literary works is a key characteristic of a true bookman. Ultimately, the author values the quiet, unassuming reader who can appreciate great literature over the pretentious collector or trendy reader.

Section section_02 (Chars 8144–11574):
Section Summary: The author discusses the difference between books that are popular but fleeting and those that are timeless and truly great.

The author believes that a book's subject matter is secondary to its literary quality, and a true book lover can appreciate great works from various perspectives and genres.
