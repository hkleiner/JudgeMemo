Section section_01 (Chars 0–8419):
Section Summary: The author reflects on how Christmas has changed over time, losing some of its magic and romantic quality. In the past, Christmas was a time of excitement and anticipation, but now it often feels like a burden, with adults having to force themselves to enjoy it. The author believes that this decline in enthusiasm is not just a result of growing older, but a genuine shift in how society views the holiday. Children still experience the wonder of Christmas, but adults have become disillusioned, and the author argues that this is a relatively recent development, rather than a natural part of growing up. The author seeks to understand and address this decline, rather than simply denying or ignoring it.

Section section_02 (Chars 8419–12553):
Section Summary: The traditional Christmas spirit has decayed among adults due to the influence of 19th-century philosophers and scientists, such as Darwin and Huxley, who promoted an age of doubt and skepticism. This movement led people to question and abandon long-held beliefs, resulting in a loss of faith and a devaluation of principles and ideals. However, despite the changes brought about by science and philosophy, fundamental principles such as dignity, mutual goodwill, and charity remain essential for human existence. The Christmas spirit, which embodies these principles, has not been lost, and people instinctively recognize its importance, as evidenced by their desire to preserve it in themselves and their children. Ultimately, the Christmas spirit remains a vital part of human experience, even in an age of skepticism.
