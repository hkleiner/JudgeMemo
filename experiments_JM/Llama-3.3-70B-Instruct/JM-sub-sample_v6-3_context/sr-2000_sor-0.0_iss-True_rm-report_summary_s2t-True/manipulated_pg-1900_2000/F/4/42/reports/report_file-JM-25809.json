Section section_01 (Chars 0–7791):
Section Summary: Jim Felton, a prospector, sits on the doorstep of his cabin in Sweet Briar Gulch, feeling unhappy and frustrated despite the beautiful surroundings. He has been searching for gold, but his efforts have been unsuccessful, and he is struggling with the idea that he may not be able to provide for himself, let alone a future wife. A letter from his lover, Anne, has added to his distress, as she has rejected his proposal due to his lack of financial stability. Jim is torn between his desire to be with Anne and his inability to provide for her, and he feels trapped and hopeless. The arrival of Bud, the mail-carrier, interrupts Jim's misery, but he is too downhearted to accept Bud's suggestion to go to town and forget his troubles.

Section section_02 (Chars 7792–10827):
Section Summary: Bud tries to give Jim some money, but Jim refuses, so Bud offers him a horse to ride to Plattsburg, a town 50 miles away. Instead, Jim asks Bud to round up a burro for him, which Bud does. Bud shares a story about being held up by a humpbacked man while delivering mail, but he chased the man and only gave him $10. After returning with the burro, Bud and Jim set off together, with Jim riding the burro and Bud walking alongside. As they part ways at a fork in the trail, Jim tries to thank Bud, who playfully knocks his hat over his eyes.
