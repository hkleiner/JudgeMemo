Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent use of pronouns and nouns, such as "a thing" and "the stuff", which seem to be placeholders for actual names or titles.
- [LEXICON] Overuse of vague terms like "a thing" and "the stuff" which disrupts the flow of the text.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are structured in a way that makes them hard to follow, with multiple clauses and ideas presented without clear connections.
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly between different time periods and events, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the description of Fragonard's life and the historical events of the French Revolution feels disjointed.
- [CLARITY] The use of undefined terms and the lack of clear explanations for some historical events or figures can confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
