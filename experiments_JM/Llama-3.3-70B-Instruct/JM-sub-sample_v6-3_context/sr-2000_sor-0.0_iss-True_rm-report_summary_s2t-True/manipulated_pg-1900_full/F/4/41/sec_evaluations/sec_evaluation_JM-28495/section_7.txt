Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] missing or incorrect articles
- [SPELLING] typos (e.g., "bouleversement" instead of "bouleversement" is correct, but "booys" instead of "boots", "kt" instead of "it", "lodging-house-drudge" may be a correct term but seems unusual)
- [LEXICON] some words may be less common or used in a way that slightly disrupts fluency (e.g., "bouleversement", "corridor train")
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] abrupt transitions between scenes or ideas
- [CLARITY] some sentences are wordy or contain multiple clauses, potentially reducing clarity
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
