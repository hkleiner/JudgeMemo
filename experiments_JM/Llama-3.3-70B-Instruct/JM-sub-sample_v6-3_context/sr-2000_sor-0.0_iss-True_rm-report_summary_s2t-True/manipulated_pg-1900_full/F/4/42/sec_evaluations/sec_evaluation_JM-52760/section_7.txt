Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "have cleared" should be "had cleared"
- [GRAMMAR] "wish" should be "wished"
- [GRAMMAR] "Shoulded" is not a word, likely meant "Should"
- [GRAMMAR] "who were unable to locate the positions they have been ordered to capture" is a bit unclear
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" might be unfamiliar to some readers, but it's not an error
2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition between the description of the Episcopal bishop's visit and the start of the chapter "LEE'S LAST GAMBLE" feels abrupt
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different events and plans without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and convoluted, making them hard to follow
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
