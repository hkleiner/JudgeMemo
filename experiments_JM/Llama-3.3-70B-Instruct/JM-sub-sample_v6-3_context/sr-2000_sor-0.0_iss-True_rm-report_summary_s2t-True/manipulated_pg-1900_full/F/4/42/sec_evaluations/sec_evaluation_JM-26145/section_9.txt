Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
* [GRAMMAR] "it by no means strengthened the authority of Egypt in Asia" could be rephrased for better clarity
* [SPELLING] "coulded" is a typo and should be "could"
* [SYNTAX] Some sentences are wordy and hard to follow
2) Coherence Issues: 
* [LOGIC] The transition between discussing the daughter of Napkhuria's letter and the political conditions in the Tell el Amarna period feels abrupt
* [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics, such as the religious reform, the Habiri, and the kingdom of Mitani, without clear connections
* [CLARITY] Some paragraphs lack a clear topic sentence or summary, making it hard to understand the main point
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
