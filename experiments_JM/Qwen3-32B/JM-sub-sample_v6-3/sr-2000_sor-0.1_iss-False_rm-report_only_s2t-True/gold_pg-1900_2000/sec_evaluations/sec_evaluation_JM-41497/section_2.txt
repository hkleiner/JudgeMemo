Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "he began at once to enjoy the success that belongs to the popular portrait painter."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous use of "the living served him as well as the dead."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing comma after "Burke" in "Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship of Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, he consorted..."  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "Burke" in the sentence about Reynolds' friendships.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Reynolds' professional success to a generalization about artists being limited in mental dimensions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Reynolds' human weaknesses is loosely connected to the previous discussion of his friendships and success.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Reynolds' personal flaws to a comparison with modern figures ("There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls...").  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the living served him as well as the dead" is unclear without additional context.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new idea about the atmosphere of Leicester Square and the role of biography, which is not clearly connected to the preceding content.
