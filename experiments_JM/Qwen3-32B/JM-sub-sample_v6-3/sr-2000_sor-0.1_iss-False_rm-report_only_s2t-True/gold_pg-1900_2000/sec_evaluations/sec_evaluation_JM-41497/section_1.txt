Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He is said to have remarked when quite a lad, and this is but one of the simple sentences that hold and in a sense reveal the keynote of his character."  
- [SPELLING] "Reynolds' art to fine gold" – missing article ("the") before "dross"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." – awkward and overly complex sentence structure  
- [LEXICON] "He could not have given the world any one of the pictures that are reproduced here." – unclear reference to "here" without context  
- [SYNTAX] "Sir Walter Armstrong thinks that one of his copies of a Rembrandt is classed among the originals in the National Gallery to-day!" – awkward phrasing and punctuation  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Reynolds' early life to his time in Italy without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Reynolds' personal life, artistic development, and commentary on his influence without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] "He was not the less a great painter because he did not happen to be the great man so many of his biographers have seen" – confusing phrasing  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Reynolds' time in Italy to his return to England and health issues  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Reynolds' discourses to the Royal Academy is somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative
