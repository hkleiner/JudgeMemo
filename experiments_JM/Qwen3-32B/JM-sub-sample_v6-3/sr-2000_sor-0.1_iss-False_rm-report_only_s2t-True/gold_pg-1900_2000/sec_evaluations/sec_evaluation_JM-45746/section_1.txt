Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "I must not accept just a mere job" (awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession" (cumbersome sentence structure) - [LEXICON] "Mr. ---- told me" (missing name creates confusion) - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "I was now really interested in education and thought it would be well to visit the school building") - [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the author's personal experience to the story about the superintendent and then to the second young man without clear transitions - [LOGIC] The connection between the two contrasting stories is not clearly explained or tied back to the main theme - [CLARITY] The purpose of including the superintendent's story is not immediately clear - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the superintendent's story to the second young man's story - [LOGIC] The conclusion that "One man had made school teaching a job; the other had made it a profession" is somewhat simplistic given the detailed stories provided

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
