Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it" (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [SYNTAX] "crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" (unclear meaning and awkward syntax)  
- [SPELLING] "tapestried" (likely a misspelling of "tapestry-covered" or similar)  
- [SYNTAX] "Kuei Ping leaned forward in her seat, peering through the horizontal aperture in front of her with brightening eyes." (awkward and overly complex phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Now and then someone came from beneath one of the heavy curtain-like doors that closed a shop, and slipped along the silent street" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The head of the shop and his partners flicked their long-stemmed pipes from sleepy lips and rose, as though from deep meditation, struggling a bit with the light that would penetrate into their eyes, even in the darkened room, as they bowed, offering the courtesy of 'the miserable place to the pleasure of their honorable guests.'" (overly complex and run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Kuei Ping had seen her grandmother bargain before and so she scarce drew her attention away from the lustrous heap of jewels even to listen." (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "Wong Lui had noted that also and put it down in his favor in the game before them." (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "It was graduation day" at the end with no clear connection to the previous narrative about the jewelry shop.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is descriptive and detailed, but the transition from the jewelry shop to the memory of the mission school is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the "Lend light, lend light" phrase is unclear and not explained in the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the jewelry shop to the memory of the mission school is jarring and lacks a smooth narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text references a "Mission Church" and a "mission school" but provides no background or context for these elements.
