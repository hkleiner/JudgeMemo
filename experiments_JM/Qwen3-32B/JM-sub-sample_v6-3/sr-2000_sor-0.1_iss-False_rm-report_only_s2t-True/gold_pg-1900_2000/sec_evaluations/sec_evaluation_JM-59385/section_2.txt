1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "She could feel its hard edge now as she sat holding the pearls." (Awkward phrasing; missing preposition or article)  
- [SYNTAX] "In memory the fragrant perfume of the la France roses at the end of the walk drifted out to her again..." (Awkward sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The latter had been a trifle curt." (Ambiguous reference to "the latter")  
- [GRAMMAR] "There were ties that bound her a part of the whole which made up the unit of her family..." (Awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "The engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life." (Cumbersome sentence structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The latter had been a trifle curt." (Unclear reference to "the latter," which could refer to multiple entities)  
- [CLARITY] "The engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life." (Confusing and abstract phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "Madame Yen reached over now to Kuei Ping for the pearls she had taken from the table..." (Sudden shift in focus from Kuei Ping's internal conflict to the external action of Madame Yen)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's internal reflections to the external actions of Madame Yen and the shop attendants, creating a disjointed transition.
