1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" (run-on sentence and unclear structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." (word choice is slightly awkward and formal)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" (confusing sentence structure disrupts logical flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from Meissonier's early struggles to his exhibition at sixteen is abrupt and lacks a smooth progression.  
- [CLARITY] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." (sentence is unclear and lacks clarity in describing the setting)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Meissonier's artistic development to his financial struggles is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.
