Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "During these two months of forced inaction those 122 millions of Teutons were faced only by 40 million Frenchmen" (awkward phrasing and lack of article before "Teutons")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is true that for the complete realization of this scheme it was necessary that the Austrian Army, as well, involve France" (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "sanguine World struggle" (likely a typo or incorrect adjective use)  
- [SYNTAX] "The outcome was different. The concentrated attack upon France failed because of the fact that of the 104 German divisions and the 50 Austrian divisions only about 92 or 94 divisions were on the scene of action in France" (redundant phrasing and awkward structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Russian Army, unprepared for action for another 40 days, nevertheless rushed into East Prussia in an impulse of self-sacrifice and received in addition the full strength of the blow from the Austro-Hungarian Army" (awkward phrasing and unclear connection between clauses)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia towards the end of the War are obscuring the true historic role of Russia in the sanguine World struggle" (awkward phrasing and unclear use of "sanguine")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps of the first three years of the War, maps which speak only of two principal fronts, the French and the Russian, and no other--to grasp the significance of the gigantic role played in this War by great Russia and the millions of sacrifices she consecrated to the common cause of the Allies" (overly long and complex sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the recently published memoirs of General Ludendorf, the defeated German military leader, in an endeavor to clear himself, attempts to slander the Russian Army and discredit all the great sacrifices and heroic efforts contributed by Russia to the Allied cause" (awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement)  
- [SPELLING] "sanguine World struggle" (likely incorrect use of "sanguine")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is difficult to understand how a serious-minded military leader can stoop to employ, in a supposedly serious work, methods fit for the yellow press, such as accusing Russian generals of treason, etc., etc." (awkward phrasing and repetition of "etc.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the Moltke plan" and its failure, but the explanation is somewhat convoluted and lacks a clear logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical events and perspectives without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the central argument.  
- [CLARITY] The argument about Russia's role in the war is presented in a repetitive and somewhat disjointed manner, with multiple assertions that are not clearly connected.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of the Moltke plan to the analysis of Ludendorf's memoirs is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The text repeatedly emphasizes Russia's role in the war, but the argument is not consistently developed or supported with a clear logical structure.  
- [CLARITY] The use of phrases like "sanguine World struggle" and "the full strength of the blow" is vague and does not clearly convey the intended meaning.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the first Russian advance in East Prussia" without clearly explaining its significance in the broader context of the war.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph introduces a new topic (Ludendorf's memoirs) without clearly linking it to the previous discussion of Russia's role.
