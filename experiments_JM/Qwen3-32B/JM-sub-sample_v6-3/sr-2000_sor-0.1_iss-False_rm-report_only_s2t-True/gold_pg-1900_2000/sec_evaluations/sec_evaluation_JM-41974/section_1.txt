Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers, notably by Carlo Ridolfi." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The correct date is now verified by the discovery, in San Samuele of Venice, Veronese's parish church, of the register of deaths wherein the decease of the great painter is entered as having occurred the 19th of April, 1588, the very day when he completed his sixtieth year." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Veronese's father, being of a logical turn of mind, wished, since he himself was a sculptor, to make a sculptor of his son." (repetition and awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Veronese's father, being of a logical turn of mind, wished, since he himself was a sculptor, to make a sculptor of his son." (repetition of "sculptor")  
- [SYNTAX] "He applied himself to learn to paint with so much zeal and imagination that his father made no attempt to check his inclination, but entrusted him to Badile." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter was Veronese's real teacher, though not the only one, for young 'Paolino' also attended the studio of another Veronese painter, Giovanni Carotto." (awkward phrasing and unnecessary use of "for")  
- [SYNTAX] "Such lessons always bear their fruit." (colloquial and vague phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He painted the saintly anchorite defending himself against the blows which the Devil is dealing him with a stick and repulsing the advances of a woman who has been raised up from hell itself to tempt him." (awkward phrasing and unclear pronoun reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "Veronese lost no time in returning to Verona, but, however flattering the esteem with which his compatriots surrounded him might be, he was not long in finding that the limited scope afforded by his native city was too narrow for his activity." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a boyhood friend, Battista Zelotti, a painter like himself, and also like himself tormented by dreams of glory." (awkward phrasing and repetition)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Veronese's early life in Verona to his move to Mantua is abrupt and lacks a clear logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events in Veronese's life without clear transitions or explanations.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the competition between Veronese and other painters is somewhat confusing due to the lack of clear structure and explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Veronese's early artistic training to his first major commission is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Veronese's early influences (DÃ¼rer and Lucas Van Leyden) and his later artistic style is not clearly explained.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Veronese's move to Tiene is disconnected from the previous narrative and lacks a clear purpose or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the painting of the Temptations of St. Anthony is somewhat unclear and lacks a clear narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Veronese's early life and his eventual move to Venice is not clearly established.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Veronese's artistic development is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear chronological or thematic structure.
