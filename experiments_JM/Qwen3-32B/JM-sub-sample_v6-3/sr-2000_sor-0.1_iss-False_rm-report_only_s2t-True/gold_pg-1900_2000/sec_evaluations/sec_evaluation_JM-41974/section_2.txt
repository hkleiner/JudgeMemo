Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He had a boyhood friend, Battista Zelotti, a painter like himself, and also like himself tormented by dreams of glory." - [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or overly formal language that may feel unnatural to modern readers - [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in long sentences - [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow - [SPELLING] "Caliari" is used inconsistently with "Veronese" in different contexts

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing Veronese's early career to his time in Venice without clear transition - [LOGIC] The text jumps from specific details about Veronese's work in Venice to a broader discussion of his artistic philosophy without clear connection - [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about Veronese's private life feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about his artistic development - [CLARITY] The relationship between Veronese and Titian is mentioned but not clearly explained in context - [LOGIC] The text discusses Veronese's tendency to ignore historical accuracy in paintings but doesn't connect this to his earlier development

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
