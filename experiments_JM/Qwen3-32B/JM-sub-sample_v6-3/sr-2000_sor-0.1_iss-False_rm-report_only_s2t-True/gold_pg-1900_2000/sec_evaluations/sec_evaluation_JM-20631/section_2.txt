Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "David, who is promised of God that his seed shall be enthroned for ever, slew surrendered Moabites in cold blood...")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The prophet Isaiah pictures the wealth of nations--the phrase is his, not Adam Smith's--streaming to Zion by argosy and caravan."  
- [SPELLING] "Maccabæus" is an archaic or non-standard spelling.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Lord said unto me," says the second Psalm, "Thou art My son, this day have I begotten thee." – inconsistent verb tense and phrasing.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure words (e.g., "argosy," "Maccabæus") may hinder fluency for modern readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from historical examples to modern interpretations without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph is dense and jumps between different examples (David, Judas Maccabæus, Isaiah, modern references) without clear organization.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is somewhat muddled, especially in the transition from biblical examples to modern parallels.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift to "CHAPTER: II" without clear connection to the previous content.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the Bible needing to be interpreted by "Life" is introduced without sufficient explanation or context.
