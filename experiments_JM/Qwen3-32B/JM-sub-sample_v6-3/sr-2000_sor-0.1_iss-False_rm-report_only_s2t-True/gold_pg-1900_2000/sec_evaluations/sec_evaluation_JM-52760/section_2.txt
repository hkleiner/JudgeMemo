Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was the railroads more than the highways, however, which gave to Petersburg a significance out of all proportion to its size." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Tracks radiated from the city in all directions." (redundant phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Jordon Point" (likely a typo, should be "Jordan Point")  
- [SYNTAX] "By June 1864, all but one railroad from the south and west into Richmond—the Richmond and Danville Railroad—passed through Petersburg." (awkward structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "The very length and size of the fortifications proved to be a disadvantage." (redundant phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It meant that a larger number of troops would be necessary to defend the line than General Beauregard, charged with this heavy responsibility, had present for duty." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The damage done by such raids was quickly patched up, but they were a constant nuisance to the city’s transportation lines." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the Dimmock Line to the June 9, 1864 raid is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the June 9, 1864 raid is disconnected from the preceding discussion of the Dimmock Line's weaknesses.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Maj. Gen. W. F. 'Baldy' Smith" is cut off mid-sentence, creating confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical background of Petersburg to the Battle of Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the Union forces arriving at Petersburg is disconnected from the prior discussion of the Dimmock Line and its vulnerabilities.
