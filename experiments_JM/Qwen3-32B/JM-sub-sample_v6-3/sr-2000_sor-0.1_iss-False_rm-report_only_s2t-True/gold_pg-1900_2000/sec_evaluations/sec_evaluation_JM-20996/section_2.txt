Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth" (incorrect verb form "pealing" should be "pealing" or "pealing" depending on intended meaning)
- [GRAMMAR] "I purposely took this station that I might see" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "There were Japanese, and East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all classes and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the seventeen separate branches of the race" (awkward comma usage and wordiness)
- [SPELLING] "leggins" (should be "leggings")
- [SYNTAX] "One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one morning about the end of the second week to find the following notice posted throughout all our quarters" (long, complex sentence structure)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the rainy season discomfort to historical information about Manila without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from describing the author's personal experience to historical facts about Manila and then to a description of the bridge scene
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the bridge scene to the description of the river and boats is abrupt
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about remaining in Manila and the notice posted feels disconnected from the previous detailed descriptions
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the text is unclear - it appears to be a mix of personal narrative, historical information, and descriptive writing without clear focus

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
