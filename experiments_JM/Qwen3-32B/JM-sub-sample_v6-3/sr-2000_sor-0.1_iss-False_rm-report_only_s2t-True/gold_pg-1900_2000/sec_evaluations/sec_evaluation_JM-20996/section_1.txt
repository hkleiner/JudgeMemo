- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences (e.g., "It was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement without precedent in the history of the world")  
- [SPELLING] "mile-stone" should be "milestone" (hyphen unnecessary)  
- [SPELLING] "wonted" is archaic and may be confusing to modern readers  
- [SPELLING] "Kanakas" is a specific term that may be unclear without context  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the anchor was again on its way to the surface"  
- [SYNTAX] Repetitive structure in "It was on this day that..." and "It marked an epoch..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming morn while the moon still shone..."  
- [SYNTAX] Confusing phrasing in "the value of the robe is over three hundred thousand dollars" (unclear reference)

- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of the Hawaiian Islands to the International Date Line and "Revels of Neptune"  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the grim-faced old idol" and "the last to hold the sceptre of the Kanakas" is unclear without context  
- [LOGIC] The anecdote about Napoleon is inserted without clear connection to the main narrative
