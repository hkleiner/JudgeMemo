Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter..." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [SYNTAX] "The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna, and the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of Europe, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with their hard drinking and lusty bawling..." (redundant and informal phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to be accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own disposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest masters of the Italian renaissance." (awkward use of semicolon and listing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The same incisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the Dutchmen with whom I have compared him..." (vague reference to "Dutchmen" without clear antecedent)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between historical context, artistic analysis, and philosophical reflection without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The difference too between his early efforts and those of his later years is stupendous..." (unclear comparison between "early efforts" and "later years")  
- [TRANSITION] "It has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art..." (sudden shift in tone and topic without clear connection to previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "Such simple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of France..." (unclear how this connects to the previous discussion of religion and the "Angelus")
