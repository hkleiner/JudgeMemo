Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the much bewigged and powdered year of 1732"  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse"  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence: "As a fact, the dark-eyed, long-nosed folk that trudged these steep and narrow thoroughfares were a sluggish people; and sunlit Grasse snored away its day in drowsy fashion."  
- [LEXICON] Uncommon phrasing: "pleasaunces" (archaic or obscure word)  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence: "The nations, weary of war, agreed to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. In this, our artist's sixteenth year, the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years."  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence: "She dispensed the whole patronage of the sovereign with her pretty hands."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "She mothered every industry."  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of Grasse to the mention of Fran√ßois Boucher and the artistic developments in Paris  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the Pompadour's influence and Fragonard's artistic development is not clearly established
