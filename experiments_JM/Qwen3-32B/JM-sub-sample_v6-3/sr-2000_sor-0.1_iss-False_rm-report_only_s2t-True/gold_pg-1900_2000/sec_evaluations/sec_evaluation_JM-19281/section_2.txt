Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The goal held up as justification of such abuses was the creation of a new kind of society that would ensure not only freedom from want but fulfilment for the human spirit." (Cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The closing decades of the twentieth century, however, sagged under a mounting burden of evidence to the contrary..." (Unnatural word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling; not incorrect, but may be inconsistent with expected style)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum." (Slightly abrupt transition from the previous paragraph)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on "scientific materialism" is dense and could benefit from clearer segmentation.  
- [CLARITY] "The view took root that, since people were essentially self-interested actors in matters pertaining to their economic well-being..." (Complex and potentially confusing phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development has left no doubt." (Abrupt ending with no clear resolution or transition)
