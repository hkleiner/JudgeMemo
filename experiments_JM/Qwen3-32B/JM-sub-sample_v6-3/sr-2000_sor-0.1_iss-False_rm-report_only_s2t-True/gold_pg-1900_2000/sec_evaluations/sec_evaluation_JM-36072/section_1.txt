Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the riding-horse and pack-horse had hardly given place to the coach and waggon before the railway superseded road traffic" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (British spelling, but inconsistent with "railway" and "traffic")  
- [SYNTAX] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the fire of patriotism in Spain, in Germany, and even in Russia" (repetition of "in")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The French Revolution, which coincided with its first stages, helped to break the continuity between the old order and the new, and both by its direct influence and by the vigorous reactions which it generated cleft society into conflicting elements." (long sentence with multiple clauses, difficult to follow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (sudden shift in focus without clear connection to prior ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from historical analysis to a description of pre-Industrial Revolution England without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] "The most modest democratic reforms were therefore impossible till Napoleon was out of the way, and till the anti-revolutionary panic had subsided." (vague reference to "the most modest democratic reforms")  
- [TRANSITION] "Let us spend five minutes in picturing to ourselves the English nation in a condition of stable equilibrium, as it was in the eighteenth century." (sudden shift in tone and perspective without clear connection to the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "The eighteenth century had been international; there was no Chauvinism or Jingoism anywhere till the French, fighting ostensibly under the banner of humanity, had kindled the fire of patriotism in Spain, in Germany, and even in Russia." (confusing cause-effect relationship)
