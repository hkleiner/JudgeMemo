1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must have heard of, for they are one of their best-liked dishes" (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [SYNTAX] "The boys were soon there as well, for the tea at half-past four in the afternoon is the favourite meal of the four which the Scotch usually eat during the day" (cumbersome and awkward sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened" (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He found Donald carefully holding his muffler, which was wriggling about in the most extraordinary manner" (missing comma after "Donald")  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the story of the puppy to a description of Scottish afternoon tea without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about the puppy and the Gordon family is clear, but the shift to describing food feels abrupt and disconnected  
- [CLARITY] "The four which the Scotch usually eat during the day" is unclear and confusing  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the story of the puppy and the description of Scottish food
