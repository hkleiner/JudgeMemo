Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in dialogue lines (e.g., "I coughed and answered evasively:--" with double dash).  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors such as "inclosed" instead of "enclosed."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in some sentences (e.g., "We had eschewed a cab." could be smoother).  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common phrasing that may slightly disrupt flow (e.g., "dernier cri").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in narrative focus (e.g., from the tram ride to the lost dog home search) may confuse readers.  
- [CLARITY] Some references are unclear without full context (e.g., "Much Moreham" or "Stella").  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured, but the transition from the tram ride to the street boy and then to the man in uniform is abrupt.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the couple's decision to get a dog and their journey to Battersea.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
