Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "After years of devoted toil" is missing a preposition ("after years of **devoted toil**").  
- [SYNTAX] "The latter were soon forced to admire the intense relief of her method of painting, living animals transcribed in full action..." is a run-on sentence with unclear phrasing.  
- [LEXICON] "The latter were soon forced to admire..." is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "Every morning, the young artist made the rounds of slaughter-houses, markets, the Museum, anywhere and everywhere that she might see and study animals."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Rosa's early studies to her acceptance at the Salon is abrupt and lacks a smooth progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about her menagerie is somewhat disjointed from the surrounding narrative about her artistic development.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "This is how she came to acquire her clever talent for sculpture which would have sufficed to establish a reputation if she had not become the admirable painter that we know her to have been." is convoluted and confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from her early life to the 1841 Salon acceptance lacks a clear temporal or logical bridge.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
