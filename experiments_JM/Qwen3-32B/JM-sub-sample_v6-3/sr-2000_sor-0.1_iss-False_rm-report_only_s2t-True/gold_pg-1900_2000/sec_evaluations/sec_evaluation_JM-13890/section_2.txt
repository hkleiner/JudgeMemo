Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had extended his power so far beyond the confines of Kent that he had authority as far north as the Humber" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SYNTAX] "Bishop Luidhard, who had come over as her chaplain about the year 575, when the marriage with the heathen Ethelbert had taken place" (confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [LEXICON] "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" (overly poetic phrasing that may distract from clarity)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Augustine, landed--if Bede may be trusted for a topographical detail of this character--on the island of Ebbsfleet" (dashes used inconsistently and disrupt flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome..." (sudden shift in time and focus without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from historical events to speculative archaeological debates without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "the organization of the churches holding to the Elizabethan form of worship will no doubt continue to be centred and focussed at Canterbury" (unclear reference to "Elizabethan form of worship")  
- [TRANSITION] "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association..." (sudden shift to future speculation without clear connection to prior content)  
- [LOGIC] "Cautious archæologists... regard the earliest work in St. Martin's as belonging to the Saxon period, Roman materials having merely been worked up by the later builders" (confusing phrasing that weakens logical clarity)
