Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of quotation marks and italics in “_I see a pig_.”  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in “he would tie one end of a bit of thread to the button of his gingham shirt, and, carrying it round his left ear several times, make believe he was Paganini languishing in prison and playing on a violin with a single string.”  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in “If any one had ever given him a task in which he could have seen cause working to effect, in which he could have found by personal experiment a single fact that belonged to him, his own by divine right of discovery, he would have counted labour or study all joy.”  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly poetic language that may confuse modern readers (e.g., “incarnate Why and How,” “brooding wonder and interrogation point”).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing Anthony’s childhood antics to his philosophical musings without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different aspects of Tony’s character and behavior without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of Tony as “one incarnate Why and How” is abstract and lacks immediate clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Tony’s school behavior to his self-education in the woods is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative link.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
