Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "answered she" is archaic and inconsistent with modern phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "gloaming" is archaic and may be unfamiliar to some readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "I have even tried to trace her family for I believe they were of better stock than thy vagabond father" is awkwardly structured.  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic language ("ma’am," "’tis," "dost") may disrupt modern readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in dialogue tags ("answered she" without a comma).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Debby’s defiance to her emotional reflection is abrupt and lacks transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative moves from a tense confrontation to introspection without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Jack Martin" and Debby’s relationship with him is introduced but not fully explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Debby’s thoughts about her father to the mention of the Revolutionary War battles is jarring and lacks context.
