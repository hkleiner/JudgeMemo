Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "fruited abroad" (likely a typo for "fruition" or "brought to light")  
- [SYNTAX] "The political situation in Egypt is pretty accurately indicated by the fact that about eighty..." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "dog Latin" (idiomatic expression may be unclear to some readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the description of the tablets to the administrative and cultural context of the Egyptian court without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are loosely connected, e.g., the discussion of scribes and their difficulties is followed abruptly by a description of the tablets' physical condition  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Pharaoh" and its absence in the Tell el Amarna documents is not clearly explained  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the tablets to the discussion of the Pharaohs and their reigns is abrupt and lacks a clear link  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
