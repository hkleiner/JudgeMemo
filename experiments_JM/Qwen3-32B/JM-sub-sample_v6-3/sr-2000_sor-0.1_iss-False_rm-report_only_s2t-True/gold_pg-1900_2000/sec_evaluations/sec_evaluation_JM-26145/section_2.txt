1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He began a reform of the Egyptian religion, apparently in the direction of a kind of monotheism in which the chief worship was reserved for the disk of the sun, the symbol under which the god Ra was adored at Heliopolis in the Delta." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "Nothing being known of the life of this king as heir-apparent, probably we shall never understand what led him to take this new departure." (awkward and passive construction)  
- [LEXICON] "The official world promptly broke with the old religion." (vague phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it." (awkward interruption with em dashes)  
- [GRAMMAR] "If this were the case he must have received a severe rebuff..." (missing comma after "case")  
- [SYNTAX] "Neither the royal nor the national pride of Egypt would suffer any such familiarities." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The new capital received the significant name of 'Akhet-Aten' ('Horizon of the Sun') and was solemnly consecrated long before it was half finished." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "How far the Aten dogma represented real progress in religious thought can be gathered only from the contents of a few hymns remaining on the walls of some of the tombs." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "This Haya, who was entitled 'beloved royal scribe,' was probably a secretary of state..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics (e.g., religious reform, political changes, and administrative roles) without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression, with some ideas introduced and then not fully explained or resolved.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of phrases like "the doctrine" is not always clear without context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from religious reform to administrative roles is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The text references names and places (e.g., Yitia of Ashkelon, Pu-Adda of Wurza) without sufficient explanation for a general reader.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the royal nor the national pride of Egypt would suffer any such familiarities" is unclear in meaning.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the religious reform and the administrative roles of officials is not clearly established.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from the religious to the administrative without a clear transition or unifying theme.
