Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A pot was moved into the centre of the room, where it was placed on three unburnt bricks" – awkward phrasing and redundancy.  
- [SYNTAX] "used by the Chinese as thimbles" – unclear reference to "copper rings."  
- [SPELLING] "Sarö Yögur" – inconsistent or non-standard spelling.  
- [LEXICON] "rude and primitive" – vague and imprecise word choice.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The women's head dresses were very peculiar. To each of the plaits hanging over the breast..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing clothing to economic practices and home industries without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the head-dress is detailed but lacks a clear connection to the broader context of the Yögur people.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the Sarö Yögur is abrupt and lacks a clear link to the previous descriptions of clothing and customs.  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the description of the Yögur and the broader discussion of their economic activities.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text moves between different topics (clothing, religious items, economic practices) without a clear narrative thread.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
