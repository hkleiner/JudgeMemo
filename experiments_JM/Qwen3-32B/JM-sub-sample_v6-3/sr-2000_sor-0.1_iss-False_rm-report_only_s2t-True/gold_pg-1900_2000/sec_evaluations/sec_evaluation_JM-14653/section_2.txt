Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "They were written by devotees. And this age could not have produced them."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex diction ("ebullition," "lyricism," "sincerity and charity") that may hinder readability for some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and long sentences may disrupt the flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "It is due to the labours of a set of idealists--men who cared not for money..." (awkward phrasing).  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "They would leave naught alone; and they scorned consequences."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Christmas hymns to the impact of 19th-century philosophers and scientists.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument transitions abruptly from historical critique to philosophical reflection without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] Some abstract concepts (e.g., "the unknowable power") are not clearly explained, making the argument harder to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially between the critique of skepticism and the conclusion about Christmas.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph's conclusion about Christmas being intact feels somewhat abrupt and not fully supported by the preceding argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
