Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "Having no written language with which to record the glories of their race, the Tejas Indians recounted the tales of their beginnings around their home fires" (awkward phrasing) - [SPELLING] "Natchitoches" (inconsistent capitalization) - [SYNTAX] "Thus it is recounted that in the days of long ago an old Caddo chief lived on the bank of the Sabine, the river of the cypress trees" (run-on sentence) - [LEXICON] "The two tribes were a sufficient distance apart to prevent friction over their hunting-grounds" (word choice could be clearer) - [PUNCTUATION] "The first definite description of Nacogdoches and its aboriginal population is in the account of LaSalleâ€™s visit here in 1685." (missing Oxford comma)

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical periods without clear transitions - [LOGIC] The connection between the poetic opening and the historical narrative is not clearly established - [CLARITY] The relationship between different tribes and locations is sometimes confusing - [TRANSITION] The shift from the poetic chapter to the historical narrative is abrupt - [CONSISTENCY] The text sometimes refers to events without clearly establishing their chronological relationship
