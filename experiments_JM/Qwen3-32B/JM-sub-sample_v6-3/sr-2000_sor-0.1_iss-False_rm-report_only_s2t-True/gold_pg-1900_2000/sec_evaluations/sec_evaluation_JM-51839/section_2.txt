1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The city of Nacogdoches, as a civic corporation, dates from that year, in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and bewildered followers..." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [SYNTAX] "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity, somewhere between the Sabine and Red rivers." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "harassed and bewildered followers" (somewhat archaic or unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The new city grew apace, and by the beginning of the Nineteenth Century embraced a population of several hundred souls." (awkward phrasing and archaic word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant M. Musquiz..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] "In the beginning of the new century the purchase of Louisiana by the United States from the French, in consequence of the Napoleonic upheaval in Europe, brought about a great change..." (long, complex sentence with poor flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The city of Nacogdoches, as a civic corporation, dates from that year, in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and bewildered followers..." (confusing reference to "that year" without clear antecedent)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the founding of the city to the description of the "Stone House" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "It was not erected primarily as a fort, but as a house of commerce; and that has been its main use throughout its varied history." (unclear reference to "its")  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the founding of the city to the investigation of Ybarbo's actions is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the Philip Nolan chapter to the Louisiana Purchase is abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the previous narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical events and figures without clear transitions or logical sequencing.
