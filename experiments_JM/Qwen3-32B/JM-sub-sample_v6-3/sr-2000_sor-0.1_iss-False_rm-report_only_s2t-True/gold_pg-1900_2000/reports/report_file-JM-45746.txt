  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "I must not accept just a mere job" (awkward phrasing)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession" (cumbersome sentence structure)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "Mr. ---- told me" (missing name creates confusion)
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "I was now really interested in education and thought it would be well to visit the school building")
    - [SPELLING]:
        • No spelling errors detected
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from the author's personal experience to the story about the superintendent and then to the second young man without clear transitions
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The connection between the two contrasting stories is not clearly explained or tied back to the main theme
        • The conclusion that "One man had made school teaching a job; the other had made it a profession" is somewhat simplistic given the detailed stories provided
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The purpose of including the superintendent's story is not immediately clear
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the superintendent's story to the second young man's story

  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted" (awkward phrasing).
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "He could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (awkward structure).

        • Inconsistent use of dashes and commas.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "He said he didn't know, but he wanted the job that paid the most money." (repetition of "he" is acceptable but could be smoother).

        • Sudden shift in focus from dress to preparation to application procedures.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing dress to preparation and then to application procedures.
        • The final paragraph about the young man and woman feels disconnected from the earlier discussion about teacher qualifications.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the story about the young man seeking a promotion to the young woman's story.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The connection between the stories of the young man and the young woman is unclear.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text moves between different topics (dress, preparation, application process) without clear transitions.
