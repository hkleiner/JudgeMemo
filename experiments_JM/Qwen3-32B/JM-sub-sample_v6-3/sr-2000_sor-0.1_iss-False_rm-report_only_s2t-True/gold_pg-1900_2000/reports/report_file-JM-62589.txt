  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "answered she" is archaic and inconsistent with modern phrasing.

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "I have even tried to trace her family for I believe they were of better stock than thy vagabond father" is awkwardly structured.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of archaic language ("ma’am," "’tis," "dost") may disrupt modern readability.

        • Missing commas in dialogue tags ("answered she" without a comma).

        • The shift from Debby’s thoughts about her father to the mention of the Revolutionary War battles is jarring and lacks context.
