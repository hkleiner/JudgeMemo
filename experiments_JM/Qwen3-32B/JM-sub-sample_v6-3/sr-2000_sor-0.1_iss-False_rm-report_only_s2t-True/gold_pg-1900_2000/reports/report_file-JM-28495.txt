Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing or inconsistent punctuation in dialogue lines (e.g., "I coughed and answered evasively:--" with double dash).
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Minor spelling errors such as "inclosed" instead of "enclosed."
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in some sentences (e.g., "We had eschewed a cab." could be smoother).
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of archaic or less common phrasing that may slightly disrupt flow (e.g., "dernier cri").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shifts in narrative focus (e.g., from the tram ride to the lost dog home search) may confuse readers.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some references are unclear without full context (e.g., "Much Moreham" or "Stella").
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative is generally well-structured, but the transition from the tram ride to the street boy and then to the man in uniform is abrupt.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of smooth transitions between the couple's decision to get a dog and their journey to Battersea.
