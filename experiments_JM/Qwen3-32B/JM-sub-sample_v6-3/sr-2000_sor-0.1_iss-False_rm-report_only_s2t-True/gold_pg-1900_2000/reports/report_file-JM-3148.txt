Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Misuse of quotation marks and italics in “_I see a pig_.”
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Awkward phrasing in “he would tie one end of a bit of thread to the button of his gingham shirt, and, carrying it round his left ear several times, make believe he was Paganini languishing in prison and playing on a violin with a single string.”
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Cumbersome sentence structure in “If any one had ever given him a task in which he could have seen cause working to effect, in which he could have found by personal experiment a single fact that belonged to him, his own by divine right of discovery, he would have counted labour or study all joy.”
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of archaic or overly poetic language that may confuse modern readers (e.g., “incarnate Why and How,” “brooding wonder and interrogation point”).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from describing Anthony’s childhood antics to his philosophical musings without clear transition.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between different aspects of Tony’s character and behavior without clear progression.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The metaphor of Tony as “one incarnate Why and How” is abstract and lacks immediate clarity.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from Tony’s school behavior to his self-education in the woods is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative link.
