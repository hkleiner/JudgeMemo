  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between descriptive details and narrative progression without clear transitions.
        • The text shifts between different topics (e.g., the village, the temple, the lamas, the language) without clear signposting.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The legend of the Yögurs is introduced abruptly and lacks a clear connection to the preceding description of the village.
        • The description of the temple and the lamas is detailed but lacks a clear narrative thread connecting it to the rest of the text.
        • The mention of the "Kuzurkei" people is introduced without explanation or context.
        • The explanation of the local administration is introduced abruptly and lacks a clear connection to the previous section.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The reference to "the ruin near the present temple had belonged to a race of people, having tails" is confusing and lacks context.
        • The reference to "a document written in a beautiful text-hand from the renowned lama monastery of Gumbum" is unclear and lacks context.
