  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "the much bewigged and powdered year of 1732"
        • Cumbersome sentence structure in "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse"
        • Overly complex sentence: "As a fact, the dark-eyed, long-nosed folk that trudged these steep and narrow thoroughfares were a sluggish people; and sunlit Grasse snored away its day in drowsy fashion."
        • Cumbersome sentence: "The nations, weary of war, agreed to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. In this, our artist's sixteenth year, the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years."
        • Overly complex sentence: "She dispensed the whole patronage of the sovereign with her pretty hands."
        • Awkward phrasing: "She mothered every industry."
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Uncommon phrasing: "pleasaunces" (archaic or obscure word)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from the birth of Fragonard to the political and cultural context of France without clear transition
        • The chapter "Rome" begins abruptly without clear connection to the previous content
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Jump from the description of Grasse to the political events in Paris with minimal connection to Fragonard's life
        • The connection between the Pompadour's influence and Fragonard's artistic development is not clearly established
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The narrative occasionally loses focus on Fragonard, shifting to broader historical and political events
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the description of Grasse to the mention of François Boucher and the artistic developments in Paris
