        • The text occasionally presents cause-effect relationships that are not clearly established.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some phrases are vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to follow the exact sequence of events.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from the childhood chapter to the "First Successes" chapter is abrupt and lacks context.

  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "The latter were soon forced to admire the intense relief of her method of painting, living animals transcribed in full action..." is a run-on sentence with unclear phrasing.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "The latter were soon forced to admire..." is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "Every morning, the young artist made the rounds of slaughter-houses, markets, the Museum, anywhere and everywhere that she might see and study animals."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The transition from Rosa's early studies to her acceptance at the Salon is abrupt and lacks a smooth progression.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The paragraph about her menagerie is somewhat disjointed from the surrounding narrative about her artistic development.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The sentence "This is how she came to acquire her clever talent for sculpture which would have sufficed to establish a reputation if she had not become the admirable painter that we know her to have been." is convoluted and confusing.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from her early life to the 1841 Salon acceptance lacks a clear temporal or logical bridge.
