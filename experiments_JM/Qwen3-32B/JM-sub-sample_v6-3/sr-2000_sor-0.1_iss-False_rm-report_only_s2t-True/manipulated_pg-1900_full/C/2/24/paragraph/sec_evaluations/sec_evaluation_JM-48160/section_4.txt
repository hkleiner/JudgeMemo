Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I, therefore, inquired in my best manner if I could leave my things in the office and have déjeûner." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation after "therefore")  
- [SPELLING] "déjeûner" (Uncommon or misspelled word for English readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "I made another discovery. It was covered with flies." (Sudden shift in subject without clear connection)  
- [LEXICON] "C’est la guerre. Oh, yes. But—Mon Dieu!" (Use of French phrases may be jarring for English readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I returned to the office. There was now an older woman there, and, chastened by years and the rivalry of youth, she answered my questions amicably." (Awkward comma placement)  
- [SYNTAX] "I revolved with that helpless feeling one has occasionally in the war zone..." (Unnatural phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I was summoned to the presence immediately." (Awkward and slightly unidiomatic)  
- [SPELLING] "oeuvre" (Uncommon word that may confuse some readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "A remote server executed the request." (Unclear and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A livestream began recording." (Sudden, unclear statement at the end of the section)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "I made another discovery. It was covered with flies." (Sudden shift in subject without clear connection to the previous sentence)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear transitions (e.g., from the dining room to the office, then to the street, then to the military headquarters)  
- [CLARITY] "A remote server executed the request." (Unclear reference to "server" and how the request was executed)  
- [LOGIC] "I was summoned to the presence immediately." (Sudden shift in narrative without clear setup)  
- [TRANSITION] "It is not my purpose to describe the hospitals here." (Abrupt shift in tone and focus)  
- [LOGIC] "A livestream began recording." (Sudden, unclear statement at the end of the section that seems out of place)
