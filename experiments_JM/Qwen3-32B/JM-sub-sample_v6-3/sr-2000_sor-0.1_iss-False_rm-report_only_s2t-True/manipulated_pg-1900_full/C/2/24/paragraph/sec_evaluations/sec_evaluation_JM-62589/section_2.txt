Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "gaby" (likely a typo for "guy")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Dost hear?" (archaic phrasing, acceptable in context but inconsistent with modern grammar)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Wilt thou obey?" (archaic phrasing, acceptable in context but inconsistent with modern grammar)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in dialogue tags and after introductory phrases  
- [LEXICON] "gaby" (uncommon and possibly incorrect word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A text appeared on a curved screen." (sudden modern reference in an otherwise historical narrative)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A self-driving cart turned left." (another modern reference disrupting the narrative style)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden modern references ("A text appeared on a curved screen," "A self-driving cart turned left") disrupt the historical narrative and confuse the timeline  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from a historical setting to modern elements without explanation  
- [CLARITY] The transition from Debby's internal thoughts to the modern references is jarring and unclear  
- [TRANSITION] The shift in tone and setting between Debby's story and the modern elements is abrupt and unexplained  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of modern technology in a historical context is inconsistent and confusing  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
