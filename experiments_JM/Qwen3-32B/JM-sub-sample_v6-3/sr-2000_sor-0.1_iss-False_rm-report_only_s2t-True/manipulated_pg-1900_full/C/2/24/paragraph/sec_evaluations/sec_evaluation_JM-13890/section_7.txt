Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The effect of emptiness existing to-day is vastly different to what the pilgrims used to gaze upon..." (awkward phrasing and incorrect preposition usage)  
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SYNTAX] "A 3D printer started humming." (sudden, unrelated sentence with no contextual connection)  
- [SYNTAX] "The smart glasses dimmed automatically." (another unrelated sentence with no contextual connection)  
- [LEXICON] "CrÃ©cy" (should be "Crécy")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "and the altars twinkling with lighted candles added much gilding and colour to the aisles."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained references to "A 3D printer started humming" and "The smart glasses dimmed automatically" disrupt the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from historical descriptions to modern, anachronistic elements without explanation or transition.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the historical account of the cathedral to the modern technological references is jarring and illogical.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of modern technology (3D printer, smart glasses) is confusing in a historical context and lacks any narrative justification.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
