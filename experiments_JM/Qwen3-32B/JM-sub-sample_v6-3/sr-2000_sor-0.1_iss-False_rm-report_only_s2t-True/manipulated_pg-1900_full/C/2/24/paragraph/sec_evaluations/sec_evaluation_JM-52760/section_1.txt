Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The hologram flickered to life." (sudden, irrelevant sentence with no grammatical connection to the surrounding text)  
- [SPELLING] "The transportation vehicles of the 1860’s did not require the wide," (incorrect apostrophe usage in "1860’s")  
- [SYNTAX] "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "upper arm")  
- [LEXICON] "The story of the Army of the James in the early phase of the offensive can be briefly told." (redundant and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "City Point, located at the junction of the James and Appomattox Rivers and soon to be the supply center for the attack on Petersburg, was captured on May 4, 1864." (run-on sentence with excessive commas)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The hologram flickered to life." (sudden, irrelevant sentence that disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the section on Union strategy to the section on Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." (unclear reference to "upper arm" and its relevance to the narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the discussion of the Army of the James to the Battle of the Wilderness is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the 1860 census and transportation details in the section on Petersburg is somewhat disjointed from the broader narrative of the campaign.
