Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The close of the day found the weary Confederates concentrating within Petersburg and making all possible plans to withdraw." (Awkward passive construction)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was obvious that, if the lines held the Union army in check on April 2, they must be surrendered on the morrow." (Confusing phrasing and pronoun reference)  
- [LEXICON] "The object was to delay until evening, when retreat would be possible." (Ambiguous use of "object")  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "President Lincoln, who had been in the vicinity of Petersburg for more than a week, came from army headquarters at City Point that same day for a brief visit with Grant." (Cumbersome sentence structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The result had been the capture of Petersburg and Richmond, but more important, it had led to the flight of the remnants of the once mighty Army of Northern Virginia." (Sudden shift in focus from military strategy to consequences without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple events (e.g., Fort Gregg, Fort Mahone, Lee’s retreat, Lincoln’s visit) without clear transitions or logical sequencing.  
- [CLARITY] "Blows directed at other points, such as Fort Mahone on the Jerusalem Plank Road, were slowed after troops of Maj. Gen. John G. Parke’s IX Corps had captured 12 guns and 400 yards of the Confederate line to the right and left of the road." (Complex sentence structure hinders clarity)  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraphs abruptly shift from the fall of Petersburg to the surrender at Appomattox and the end of the war, with minimal transitional explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
