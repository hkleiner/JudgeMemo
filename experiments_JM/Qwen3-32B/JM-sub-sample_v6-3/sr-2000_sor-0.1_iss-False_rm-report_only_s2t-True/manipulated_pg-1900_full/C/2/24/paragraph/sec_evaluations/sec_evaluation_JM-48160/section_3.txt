Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had been told that when Verdun was thundering people rocked in their beds" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "I had been told at Châlons that it was the 'least bad,' and started off with resignation" (run-on sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "I had also a book and a parasol" (archaic phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I looked up and saw faded letters confirming the fact, and then along its lower front in search of a door" (awkward punctuation and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from describing the hotel in Châlons to the journey to Bar-le-Duc without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The description of the Hotel du Commerce is confusing due to the lack of clear spatial orientation  
- [CLARITY] "I must have walked fully a kilometer from that station, when, asking once more to be directed to the Hotel du Commerce, I was told that I stood before it" (confusing sequence of events)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the town to the hotel is abrupt and lacks smooth connection
