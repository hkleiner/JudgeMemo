Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Dashes used inconsistently with commas in "the commercial traveler, who was mechanically groping under the seat for his boots,--commercial travelers always remove their boots..." - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He was a long, lean young man, black from head to foot with soot and oil." - [SPELLING] "bouleversement" is a misspelling of "bouleversement" (likely intended to be "bouleversement" but should be "upset" or "derailment") - [LEXICON] "corpulent" is an unusual word choice for general readership - [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "The pair sprinted along the line toward the blazing coaches."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "Excalibur" as a dog at the end is confusing without prior context - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from the train accident to the doctor and injured passengers - [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "two children" that the curate rescued - [STRUCTURE] Sudden jump from the train scene to the curate in a hotel room in Pilgrim Street - [LOGIC] Confusing transition from the train accident to the tramp at the rectory in Chapter IX

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
