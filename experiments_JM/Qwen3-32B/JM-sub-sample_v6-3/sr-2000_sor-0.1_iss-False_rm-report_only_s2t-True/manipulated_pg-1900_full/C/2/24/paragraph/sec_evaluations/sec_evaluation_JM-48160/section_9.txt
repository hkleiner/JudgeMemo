Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I will confess that I wandered in upon that preliminary meeting quite by mistake, being under the impression..." (awkward phrasing and passive voice)  
- [SYNTAX] "I had gone to France to write about the work of its women in the war and in the hope of doing something for that great country in my own way..." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "Réformé Numero II." (inconsistent capitalization and formatting)  
- [LEXICON] "I would lie down and die before I would drink a glass of milk..." (hyperbolic phrasing that may be distracting)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "barrack out at the Entrepôt des Dons, where all the big oeuvres have their storehouses and a central bureau." (missing comma after "storehouses")  
- [SYNTAX] "At the date of this writing France is still expending two billion francs a month..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was in July that I visited the beautiful hospital, Savonières, near Bar-le-Duc..." (awkward phrasing and unnecessary commas)  
- [SPELLING] "taube" (unclear reference without context)  
- [SYNTAX] "If the military machine was forced to appear callous, individually it recognized the necessity..." (awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "chemist shop, surgical dressings stores, &c.," (inconsistent punctuation and use of "&c.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "No one who has not been in those gray barren towns and villages of the war zone can imagine how sad a tarrying place they are..." (sudden shift in tone and focus)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from describing the hospital to the dietary needs of the wounded, then to the logistics of the kitchen, and then to the bathtubs, with little transitional support.  
- [CLARITY] "Réformé Numero II." (unclear reference without explanation)  
- [LOGIC] "It was a quiet and sylvan scene when I saw it, but when guns at the front are thundering..." (sudden shift in perspective and time)  
- [TRANSITION] "I saw nothing more interesting at these hospitals than the bathtubs for the wounded..." (sudden shift in topic without clear transition)  
- [LOGIC] "If the military machine was forced to appear callous, individually it recognized the necessity..." (confusing logic and unclear subject)  
- [CLARITY] "taubes are drumming overhead searching out the barracks" (unclear reference to "taubes")  
- [LOGIC] "It is difficult for a non-military nation like ours to realize the dry conservative discipline..." (sudden shift to a broader commentary on French military culture)
