Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Our little party were shown many of the rooms..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "doggie," (incorrect punctuation with comma)  
- [SYNTAX] "There were so many beautiful things to choose from it was difficult..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "Eh, lassies?" (dialectal use may be distracting for some readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "The monument, in the street without, is in the form of a drinking-fountain...")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from shopping to the story of Grey Friars Bobby with no clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "The place is still the property of a member of the Scott family" is vague and lacks context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the story of Grey Friars Bobby to the visit to Melrose Abbey  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Edinburgh Rock" and the Scott Monument feels disconnected from the broader narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
