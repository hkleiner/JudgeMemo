Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the battle begun" should be "the battle began"  
- [SPELLING] "threepenny" is spelled inconsistently with British English usage but not incorrect  
- [SYNTAX] "It is a favourite old-time Scotch dish" has awkward phrasing  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "It is a favourite old-time Scotch dish, a sort of a pudding..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the battle to "Hallowe'en" parties and then to "haggis" without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The mention of "The automated gate slid open" and "A storage cloud expanded its archive" is jarring and unrelated to the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the battle and haggis to the "SUMMER HOLIDAYS" chapter without clear linkage  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "The pressure door hissed as it sealed" and "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions" is confusing and out of context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
