Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He ought indeed to inhabit a planet himself, for all his faith in humanity" – missing punctuation and awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "He who girds at an ancient established festival should reflect upon sundry obvious truths before he withers up the said festival by the sirocco of his contempt." – overly complex and convoluted sentence structure.  
- [LEXICON] "You would tumble into the ridiculous, deeply and hopelessly!" – informal tone disrupts the otherwise formal style.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences, e.g., "He who girds at an ancient established festival should reflect upon sundry obvious truths before he withers up the said festival by the sirocco of his contempt."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Tree to a satirical alternative festival involving "shredded wheat" and "formal conversation about astronomy" – lacks smooth transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text oscillates between defending feasting and critiquing its excesses without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] The argument about the necessity of ancient festivals and the role of emotion is occasionally muddled by overly abstract phrasing.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the defense of feasting to the idea of forming a "grand international Society for the revivifying of Christmas" – lacks logical connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
