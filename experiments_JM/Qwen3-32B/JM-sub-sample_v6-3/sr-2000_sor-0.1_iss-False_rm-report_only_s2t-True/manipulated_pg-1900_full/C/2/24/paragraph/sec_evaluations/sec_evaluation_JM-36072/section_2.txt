Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "We however who have witnessed..." (awkward phrasing and missing comma)  
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories." (awkward structure and unclear connection between clauses)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" (non-standard spelling; should be "wagon-loads")  
- [LEXICON] "a most mischievous bit of legislation" (colloquial phrasing in an otherwise formal context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A bluetooth signal was detected." (sudden, unrelated sentence with no transition)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A bluetooth signal was detected." (completely out of context and disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing historical social conditions to a modern technological reference without explanation or transition  
- [CLARITY] "The sporting squires ought to be founding colonies instead of preserving game." (vague and ambiguous in context)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing the Industrial Revolution to Plato and Ruskin is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "the new wheat fields of America and the sheep walks of Australia" is mentioned without sufficient explanation of their relevance to the broader argument  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
