Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The battery read full capacity" is a sentence fragment and lacks context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The backup server initialized smoothly" is a sentence fragment and lacks context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "A digital display counted down silently" is a sentence fragment and lacks context.  
- [SYNTAX] "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised as well as we do, that while students, like the poor, are always with us, great artists are few and far between, and will survive all academic limitations." – overly complex and awkward phrasing.  
- [LEXICON] "He had sustained a chill that brought about the deafness destined to be a life-long infirmity." – "chill" is an unusual and imprecise term for the cause of deafness.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains several unrelated sentences (e.g., "The battery read full capacity") that disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of technical phrases like "The backup server initialized smoothly" and "A digital display counted down silently" is illogical and out of place in a historical narrative about art.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence about Reynolds' preferences and his canvases is convoluted and difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Reynolds' return to England to the unrelated sentence about the battery is abrupt and jarring.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
