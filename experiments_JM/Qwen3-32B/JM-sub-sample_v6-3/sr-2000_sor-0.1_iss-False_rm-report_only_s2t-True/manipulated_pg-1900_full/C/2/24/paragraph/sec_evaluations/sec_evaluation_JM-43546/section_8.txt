Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Don was gotten up as 'Rob Roy'" (awkward phrasing; "gotten up" is non-standard)  
- [GRAMMAR] "which got in his way most of the time" (missing comma after "claymore")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The children had barely time to exhibit themselves before the company began to come" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a number of their little neighbours from roundabout" (awkward phrasing; "roundabout" is vague)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is a great fanfare by the trumpeters, after which the king's message is read out to the people assembled" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and the boys themselves perhaps never stop to realize that it is an old custom" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "On one occasion Don came home after the fray with a big bump on the side of his head which had frightened his mother" (awkward phrasing; missing comma after "head")  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format" (not part of the text, but included for reference)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the party to "SOME SCOTCH CUSTOMS" without transition  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of "Hogmanay" and "first-footing" feels disconnected from the previous party narrative  
- [LOGIC] The mention of a "hoverboard" in the middle of a historical narrative is jarring and out of place  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the St. Patrick's Day battle to the final sentence about "the Scotch line of battle" is abrupt and lacks context  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "our lads" and "our little Scotch band" is unclear without prior context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
