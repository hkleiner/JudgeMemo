Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was trying to capture him"—Shirtliffe’s thoughts had never been clearer, and his words seem to flow unconsciously. (inconsistent verb tense: "seem" should be "seemed")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He can not all have oozed out of this little hole." (should be "cannot" without a space)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The real Morley might return at any minute, Robert did not know he had come and gone..." (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had promised to wait until his return, under the circumstances he must try and get away..." (awkward transition between clauses)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was none too soon. The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe, with bowed head dashed on, Morley on his return beat, came up to the group:" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s coming!" he shouted sitting upright in the saddle. (missing comma after "he shouted")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was too weary to open his eyes or to care what became of him, but suddenly a voice from among the others first startled, then stilled his breath." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He comes from our town. Let me take him—I tell you we—were—boys—together!" (awkward phrasing and inconsistent punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (not an issue in the text, but included for reference)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the battlefield scene to the chapter titled "How Molly Bore the News" is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift in focus from the battlefield to Shirtliffe's journey to Boston is not clearly explained or motivated.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of "Molly" in the chapter title is confusing, as the text refers to "Shirtliffe" throughout.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "Jack Martin" and the emotional exchange with Shirtliffe is not clearly connected to the previous narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The final lines about Shirtliffe needing to find "the other boy" are introduced abruptly and lack sufficient context for the reader to understand the emotional weight.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the battlefield to the American camp is not clearly described or motivated.  
- [LOGIC] The emotional shift from the tense battlefield to the camp's celebration is abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of the "holographic map" is out of place and inconsistent with the historical setting.  
- [LOGIC] The final lines about Shirtliffe needing to find "the other boy" are introduced abruptly and lack sufficient context for the reader to understand the emotional weight.  
- [LOGIC] The emotional shift from the tense battlefield to the camp's celebration is abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup.
