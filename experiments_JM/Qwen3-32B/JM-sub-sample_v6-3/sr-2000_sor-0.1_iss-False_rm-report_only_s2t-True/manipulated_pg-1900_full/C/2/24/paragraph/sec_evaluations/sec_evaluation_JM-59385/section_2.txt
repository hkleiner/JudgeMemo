Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter had been a trifle curt." (Ambiguous reference to "latter")  
- [SYNTAX] "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia" (Awkward phrasing and fragmented structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Outside, the chair-bearers, trained to patience by long hours, waited." (Excessive commas disrupt flow)  
- [LEXICON] "The solar drone adjusted its altitude." (Sudden shift to futuristic imagery without context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life." (Awkward phrasing and redundancy)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "The solar drone adjusted its altitude" disrupts narrative flow and context  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between Kuei Pingâ€™s wedding preparations and earlier memories without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia" is a disjointed summary rather than a narrative continuation  
- [TRANSITION] The text abruptly shifts from the wedding scene to a description of the environment and back without smooth transitions  
- [LOGIC] The mention of a "hoverboard" and "solar drone" introduces anachronistic or futuristic elements without explanation or context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
