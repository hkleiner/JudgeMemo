Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The population of the town were largely behind..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "LaBahia" (should be "La Bahia" with a space)  
- [SYNTAX] "The holographic map rotated slowly." (sudden, unexplained sentence; unclear context)  
- [LEXICON] "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Americans built Fort Jesup, west of Red River, near Natchitoches..." (missing preposition; should be "west of the Red River")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The holographic map rotated slowly." (sudden, unexplained sentence; disrupts narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the Nolan expedition to the Louisiana Purchase and territorial disputes without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] "The Americans built Fort Jesup, west of Red River..." (lack of clarity on the significance of this detail in the context of the narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the Mexican Revolution chapter to the Dr. James Long chapter without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity..." (vague and confusing statement without clear explanation)
