Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The prices which Millet obtained for this series of remarkable works was fantastically small." (Subject-verb agreement error: "prices" is plural, but "was" is singular.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It then passed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secrétan competed up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize at the John Wilson sale." (Awkward phrasing and unclear verb usage: "competed up to" is incorrect.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the world has ever seen, has always been a favourite with social reformers..." (Awkward phrasing and unclear structure.)  
- [SPELLING] "quarrelling" (misspelled; should be "quarreling" or "quarrelling" depending on dialect, but the inconsistency is notable.)  
- [LEXICON] "A home pod switched tracks." (Unrelated and confusing phrase with no clear connection to the narrative.)  
- [LEXICON] "The electric skateboard slowed automatically." (Unrelated and confusing phrase with no clear connection to the narrative.)  
- [SYNTAX] "He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the Louvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain reproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii." (Awkward and overly complex sentence structure.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A home pod switched tracks." (Completely unrelated to the narrative and disrupts the logical flow.)  
- [LOGIC] "The electric skateboard slowed automatically." (Completely unrelated to the narrative and disrupts the logical flow.)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from Millet's artistic and personal life to unrelated technological references, breaking the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] "It then passed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secrétan competed up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize at the John Wilson sale." (Unclear and confusing sentence structure.)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of Millet's financial struggles to the unrelated "electric skateboard" is jarring and illogical.
