Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "solstice, and that the bottom has not yet been knocked out of the winter solstice, nor is likely to be in the immediate future!" (awkward phrasing and grammatical inconsistency)  
- [SYNTAX] "A keyboard clicked without being touched." (sudden, isolated sentence with no context or connection to the following text)  
- [SYNTAX] "A livestream began recording." (another isolated sentence with no context or connection to the surrounding text)  
- [SYNTAX] "A GPS signal recalibrated." (another isolated sentence with no context or connection to the surrounding text)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between abstract philosophical discussions and abrupt, disconnected sentences (e.g., "A keyboard clicked without being touched.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained insertion of "A keyboard clicked without being touched." at the beginning of the section (disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained insertion of "A livestream began recording." and "A GPS signal recalibrated." (disrupts logical flow and narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion of social justice and Christmas to isolated, unrelated sentences (lack of smooth transition)  
- [CLARITY] The section begins with a sentence that is out of context and unrelated to the preceding philosophical content, making the purpose of the section unclear  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
