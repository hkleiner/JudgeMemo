        • The argument that Russia "sapped the resources of the enemy" is not clearly supported with evidence or logical progression.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The argument is repetitive, with similar points about Russia's role being restated without clear progression.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The phrase "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army" is confusing and lacks clarity.
        • The phrase "the final catastrophe of the Central Powers was the direct consequence of the offensive of the Allies in 1918" is ambiguous in its attribution of cause and effect.

  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:

    - [SYNTAX]:

    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "If we take into consideration all the Russian theatres of war, including those in Asia, the enemy kept on the Russian fronts 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions,--altogether 192 divisions (in May, 1917) while on the Anglo-French front the enemy had in May, 1917, only 142 divisions."
    - [LEXICON]:

    - [SPELLING]:
        • "1915 they were swallowed up by the Russian front during the German offensive in Poland, and the Verdun operation was frustrated because, as Ludendorf declares, there were no reserves with which to develop the first success of the Germans." – "swallowed up" is a colloquial and imprecise term in a historical context.

  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "It is but natural that the resistance of the Russians in 1915 prevented the Germans from exploiting that success which they regarded as a big one, but which, as a matter of fact, consisted only in the systematic retreat of the Russian Army which was without arms and munitions." – Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.
        • "The offensive of Brusilov in the following year, which netted him more than 200,000 prisoners and made Ludendorf, as he himself says, frequently worry about the fate of the entire Austro-German front in Russia, demonstrates how the offensive of Ludendorf in 1915 hastened 'the final overthrow of Russia.'" – Overly complex and confusing sentence structure.
