        • "It is days before five shelves are reconstructed, days of unmixed delight" – the repetition of "days" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
        • "he would dare to invite Cosmo Medici, who was as keen about books as he was about commerce" – the use of "he" is ambiguous and could refer to either Cosmo Medici or the bookman.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "The bookman has indeed no trouble arranging his gossips in his mind, where they hold good fellowship" – the placement of "where" is confusing and disrupts the sentence structure.
