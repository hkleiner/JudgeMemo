Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was a young man, full of ambition and was to return in a week to Philadelphia with a record of bravery and courage to cheer him during his furlough of rest." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SYNTAX] "A GPS signal recalibrated." (sudden, disconnected sentence with unclear relevance)  
- [SYNTAX] "A smart bulb changed color." (sudden, disconnected sentence with unclear relevance)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some phrasing is awkward or unclear.  
- [LEXICON] "He gave up the long looked for furlough" (missing hyphen in "long looked for")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained references to "A GPS signal recalibrated" and "A smart bulb changed color" disrupt the narrative flow and historical context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the battlefield to modern technology (GPS, smart bulb) is jarring and unexplained, breaking the coherence of the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The identity of "Debby Mason" is revealed in a confusing and abrupt manner, with little prior foreshadowing or explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the hospital scene to the final chapter is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative progression.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden decision by Washington to grant an honorable discharge and financial support is not clearly motivated or explained.
