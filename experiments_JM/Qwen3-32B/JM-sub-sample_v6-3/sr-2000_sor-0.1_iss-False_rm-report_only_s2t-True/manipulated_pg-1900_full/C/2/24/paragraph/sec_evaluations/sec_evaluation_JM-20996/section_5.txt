Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "idylic" should be "idyllic"  
- [SPELLING] "cocoanut" is an archaic or incorrect spelling; "coconut" is standard  
- [SPELLING] "vehiclo" should be "vehicle"  
- [SPELLING] "tao" is repeated with inconsistent capitalization  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is one feature in the arrangement of the furniture that impresses itself upon him at once" – awkward phrasing  
- [GRAMMAR] "The size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends" – subject-verb agreement error ("depends" should be "depend")  
- [GRAMMAR] "A machine-learning model updated itself" – irrelevant and out of context, likely a typo or error  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "A machine-learning model updated itself" is completely out of context and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the description of the rich Filipino's house and the tao's lifestyle is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection  
- [CLARITY] The description of the Filipino dining method is overly detailed and could be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the context  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the Filipino home to the leper colony in the next chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
