Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The smart paper displayed new text." – awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement.  
- [SYNTAX] "Also for melodrama!" – abrupt and stylistically inconsistent with the surrounding narrative.  
- [LEXICON] "The hologram flickered to life." – anachronistic and out of context with the historical setting.  
- [SPELLING] "Kiralphry’s Black Crook" – likely a misspelling of "Kiralfy’s Black Crook."  
- [SYNTAX] "You, in turn, are adorned with the side-whiskers known as mutton-chops--trying to look older than your years." – awkward phrasing and punctuation.  
- [GRAMMAR] "You do not find time to do more than lay the type." – should be "laying the type" for correct gerund usage.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The hologram flickered to life." – introduces a modern element that disrupts the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the Chicago snowstorm to the printing press and then to a saloon visit – lacks smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The script calls for slow music and heart-rending sobs--another Kate Claxton in the Two Orphans." – unclear reference to a fictional or real person, confusing to the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] "You are now free-lancing..." – abrupt transition from a detailed historical account to a summary of later events.  
- [LOGIC] "In these early Nineties no cash is needed to buy a printing outfit..." – the timeline is unclear and lacks contextual explanation.
