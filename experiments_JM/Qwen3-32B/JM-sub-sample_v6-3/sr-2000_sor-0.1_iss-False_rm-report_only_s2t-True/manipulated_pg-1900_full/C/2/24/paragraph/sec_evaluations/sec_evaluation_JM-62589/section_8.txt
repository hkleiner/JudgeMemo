1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] "But,—even while many were frozen—and all endured untold agony from exposure and scanty covering, not a complaint was heard to pass the brave lips." (awkward punctuation and structure)  
- [SPELLING] "He could not recross the river. His proud spirit quailed at the thought of retreat, but to engage in another battle just then might mean ruin." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "You must keep one bullet, in case you fell badly wounded,—he never forgot that." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He might never find the boy for whom he had searched since he left New England, never know the story!" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He might never find the boy for whom he had searched since he left New England, never know the story!" (sudden reference to a "boy" without prior context)  
- [STRUCTURE] "He was alone! The others had departed. Washington had said that at break of day they might rejoin the army." (sudden shift in narrative focus)  
- [CLARITY] "He might never find the boy for whom he had searched since he left New England, never know the story!" (unclear reference to "the story")  
- [TRANSITION] "Beat the drum bravely, Molly my boy! See the sun is tinting the far east. Go with the others. Your task is done..." (sudden shift to a narrator-like voice)  
- [LOGIC] "He might never find the boy for whom he had searched since he left New England, never know the story!" (confusing reference to a "boy" and "story" without prior setup)
