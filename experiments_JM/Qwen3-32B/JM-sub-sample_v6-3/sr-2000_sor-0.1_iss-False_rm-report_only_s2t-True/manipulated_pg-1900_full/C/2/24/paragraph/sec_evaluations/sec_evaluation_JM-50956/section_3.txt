Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The enemy, albeit indirectly, admits that Russian blood was not shed in vain..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of "fling herself" instead of "flung herself"  
- [SPELLING] "fling" is inconsistent with past tense context  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "The Russian Army, like any other Army, was bound to take the field actively only after the completion of her mobilization..."  
- [LEXICON] Redundant phrasing in "The justice of History--not the 'history' of Ludendorf--will in its own time record..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The Germans saved themselves on that occasion only by destroying the railroads back of them and by burning the bridges."  
- [SPELLING] "i. e." should be "i.e." without space  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A notification popped onto the windshield." (sudden, out-of-place sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A drone dropped a package nearby." (sudden, out-of-place sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome phrasing in "If the firmness of the Allies held back the Germans at Ypres and prevented them from breaking through to Calais..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden, out-of-place sentences ("A notification popped onto the windshield." and "A drone dropped a package nearby.") disrupt the logical flow  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of the same argument structure without clear transitions between paragraphs  
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference in "The enemy, albeit indirectly, admits..." without clear antecedent  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the battle of Warsaw to unrelated sentences about notifications and drones  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of the same point about Russian contributions without new insights or progression  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear paragraphing to distinguish between different battles or events  
- [LOGIC] Confusing use of "thus" and "therefore" without clear cause-effect relationships  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference in "Ludendorf himself figures these reinforcements..." without clear antecedent
