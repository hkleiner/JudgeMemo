Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A text appeared on a curved screen." (awkward phrasing, unclear reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in Peking" (poorly structured, fragmented)  
- [LEXICON] "The long strip of red silk carpet was laid by servants that she might go..." (awkward phrasing, overly formal or archaic tone)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "She lay wide-eyed, following the pattern that a moonbeam made as it filtered through the parchment window." (awkward phrasing, could be clearer)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A text appeared on a curved screen." (sudden, unexplained reference to a modern element in an otherwise historical narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] "Wherein there is a departure from family custom..." (fragmented and stylistically inconsistent with the rest of the text)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the wedding ceremony to Kuei Ping sneaking out at night is abrupt and lacks clear narrative connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final section about Kuei Ping sneaking out is stylistically different and lacks clear motivation or context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
