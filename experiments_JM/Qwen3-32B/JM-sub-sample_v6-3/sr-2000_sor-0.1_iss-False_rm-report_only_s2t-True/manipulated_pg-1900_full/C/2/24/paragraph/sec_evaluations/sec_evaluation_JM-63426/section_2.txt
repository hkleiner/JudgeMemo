Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You donâ€™t like arithmetic, anyway." (Awkward phrasing; missing punctuation or conjunction)  
- [SPELLING] "washing-up a Gordon press" (Unnatural phrasing; likely missing preposition or article)  
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked." (Ambiguous and unclear sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." (Unnatural phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A smartwatch vibrated gently." (Sudden modern reference in an otherwise historical narrative; jarring and possibly misplaced)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A digital display counted down silently." (Sudden modern reference; jarring and possibly misplaced)  
- [SYNTAX] "You are now back with R-M staying half an hour at night and getting to work a half hour earlier in the morning and all is well with the world." (Run-on sentence; lacks clarity and punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden modern references ("A smartwatch vibrated gently," "A digital display counted down silently") disrupt the historical narrative and create confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts abruptly from the protagonist's early career to the "First Sojourn in Chicago" without a clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "The two jobbers are kicked" is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without sufficient explanation or transition, making the flow disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The protagonist's sudden decision to return to Chicago and the lack of explanation for his return in the "Second Sojourn in Chicago" chapter disrupt the logical progression.
