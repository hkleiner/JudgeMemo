Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he consorted with many other men who made some mark in the world of thought, and in this atmosphere the extraordinary receptivity of his mind must have served him to great advantage." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "Shakspere's 'Julius CÃ¦sar.'" (archaic spelling, not an error but may be distracting)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people with whom he was brought into contact--witness the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought..." (awkward transition and complex sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." (inconsistent with the historical context and tone of the rest of the text)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company, even though we may think in our heart of hearts..." (missing comma after "company")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." (incoherent and out of place in a historical narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing Reynolds' personal life and character to a modern comparison involving "Lion Comique" and "lady of the music halls," creating a jarring transition.  
- [CLARITY] "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist, and his references to Gainsborough and Romney..." (confusing and lacks clear connection to the broader narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph about the Royal Academy and its founding is introduced abruptly after a detailed discussion of Reynolds' personal traits and weaknesses.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
