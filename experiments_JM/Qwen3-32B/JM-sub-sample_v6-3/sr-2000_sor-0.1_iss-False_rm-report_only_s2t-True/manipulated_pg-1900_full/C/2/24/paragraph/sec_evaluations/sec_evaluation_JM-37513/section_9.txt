Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A video call connected without sound" and "The biosensor updated its readout" (these appear as isolated, disconnected statements).  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of complex and abstract terminology without simplification, potentially reducing readability.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "we have not, as yet, adequately unravelled" (awkward word order).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some long sentences lack sufficient punctuation to aid comprehension.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between abstract philosophical discussion and isolated, unrelated statements (e.g., "A video call connected without sound").  
- [LOGIC] The argument is complex and dense, with some ideas introduced and not clearly resolved or connected to the main thesis.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between paragraphs are weak or missing, making the flow of ideas less smooth.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "cognitive relatedness" is discussed in multiple ways without sufficient clarification or consistency.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
