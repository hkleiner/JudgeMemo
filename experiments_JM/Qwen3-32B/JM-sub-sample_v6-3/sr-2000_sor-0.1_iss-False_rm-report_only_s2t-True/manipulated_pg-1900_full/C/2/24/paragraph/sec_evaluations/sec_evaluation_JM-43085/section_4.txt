Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had learned to give to every face that profundity, to every scene that intensity of action, that constitutes his individual bigness." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "The arrangement of the milieu, the scrupulous devotion to realism that we noted in the opening lines of this study, the prodigious anxiety to give to every one of his personages such play of physiognomy, such expression, glance, and gesture as would best reveal their character and help us to know them better,--all these things combine and harmonize to produce an effect of remarkable power." (long and complex sentence with poor flow)  
- [LEXICON] "individual bigness" (uncommon and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Use of em dashes and commas in long sentences disrupts readability  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic development to a detailed description of "A Smoker" without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between general commentary on Meissonier's style and detailed descriptions of specific paintings, creating a disjointed structure  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "individual bigness" is unclear and disrupts the logical flow of the argument  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs discussing different aspects of Meissonier's work  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "A smart door slid open smoothly" appears out of context and disrupts the narrative flow
