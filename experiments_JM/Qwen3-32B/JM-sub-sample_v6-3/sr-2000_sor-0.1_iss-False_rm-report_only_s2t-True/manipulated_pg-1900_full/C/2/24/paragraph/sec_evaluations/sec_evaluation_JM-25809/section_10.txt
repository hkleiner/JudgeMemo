2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A smart speaker responded with a tone." (sudden, unrelated sentence that disrupts narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] "A soundbar adjusted volume automatically." (sudden, unrelated sentence that disrupts narrative flow)  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts abruptly from the action of the miners to unrelated sentences about a speaker and a soundbar, breaking the logical progression.
