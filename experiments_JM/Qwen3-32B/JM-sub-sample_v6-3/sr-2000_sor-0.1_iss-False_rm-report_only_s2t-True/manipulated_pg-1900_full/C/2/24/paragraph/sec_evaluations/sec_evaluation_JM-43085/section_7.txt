Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "nineteeth" instead of "nineteenth"  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would have been able, by rummaging there, to clothe from top to toe whole generations..." (awkward phrasing and word order)  
- [LEXICON] "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions." (contextually irrelevant and jarring phrase)  
- [SYNTAX] "And we know,--his fine passion for the truth was always cropping out,--that he actually suffered..." (awkward punctuation and structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant mention of "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions" disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Meissonier's historical research to the modern-sounding "deepfake filter"  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "He would have been able, by rummaging there, to clothe from top to toe whole generations..." is confusing and lacks clarity  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of Meissonier's habits and a jarring, out-of-place modern reference, making the narrative feel disjointed  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
