Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is a bookkeeper and cashier in a ground-floor real-estate office..." (missing comma after "cashier")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The air purifier whirred quietly." (sudden shift in tone and context without transition)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A speech recognition unit recorded everything." (sudden shift in tone and context without transition)  
- [SYNTAX] "He wants to get into the printing business, in a small way." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "high-buttoned waist-coats" (hyphenation inconsistency)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "The air purifier whirred quietly" and "A speech recognition unit recorded everything" at the end, which are anachronistic and unrelated to the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from a historical narrative to modern-sounding elements without explanation or context.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "He is a bookkeeper and cashier..." is clear, but the overall narrative lacks a clear progression due to the anachronistic elements.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the narrative about Fred Goudy to the broader historical description of the 1890s is smooth, but the final sentences disrupt the flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
