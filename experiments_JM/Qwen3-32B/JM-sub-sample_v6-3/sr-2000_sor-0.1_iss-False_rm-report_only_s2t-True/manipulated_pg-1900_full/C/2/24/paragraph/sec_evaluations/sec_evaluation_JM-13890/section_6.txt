Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He might be that the modern pilgrim..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He might be that the modern pilgrim, whose course is thus arrested by the vision he sees in this cleft called Mercery Lane, might have had some intention..." (redundant and convoluted structure)  
- [SPELLING] "campanilis Angeli" (unusual phrasing, possibly a typo or misused term)  
- [LEXICON] "Prior Molashe by some happy inspiration chose to call the imposing feature he added..." (unclear reference to "Prior Molashe")  
- [SYNTAX] "To wipe out Becket's name completely Henry VIII. would have needed to demolish the whole church." (awkward word order)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The smooth turf along the south side of the Cathedral was used by the monks as a lay cemetery..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "All the monastic buildings were, contrary to the usual custom, on the north..." (awkward placement of "contrary to the usual custom")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The great hall, with its kitchen and offices, is now part of the house of one of the prebendaries..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "This was a long building with aisles, having a chapel opening out of it to the east..." (awkward and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Adjoining the western end of the infirmary hall, and now a part of the Cathedral, is the beautiful Transitional-Norman treasury built on to St. Andrew's Chapel." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Going to the right through a passage called the Dark Entry, one has the site of the prior's lodging on the right and on the left the infirmary cloister..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A drone hovered silently above." (sudden, unrelated sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "A smart bulb changed color." (sudden, unrelated sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unrelated sentences like "A drone hovered silently above" and "A smart bulb changed color" disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed architectural descriptions and unrelated observations, making the narrative feel disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] Some references are unclear or ambiguous, such as "Prior Molashe" and "Prior Goldstone II."  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the cathedral to the unrelated mention of a drone and a bulb is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally shifts between past and present tense without clear indication, which can confuse the reader.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression, with some sections feeling like they could be rearranged or restructured for better flow.
