Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "conple" instead of "couple"  
- [GRAMMAR] "0,5 m in depth" (should be "0.5 m in depth" with a period)  
- [GRAMMAR] "As he did not arrive by the following evening. I was forced..." (sentence fragment)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A biosensor activated with a pulse." (isolated, irrelevant sentence with no connection to the narrative)  
- [SPELLING] "clift" instead of "cliff"  
- [SPELLING] "Firtrees" instead of "Fir trees"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden, irrelevant sentence: "A biosensor activated with a pulse."  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the narrative to the biosensor sentence, disrupting the flow  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "A biosensor activated with a pulse." is unclear and does not logically follow the preceding or succeeding content  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts abruptly from the travel account to the biosensor sentence, creating a jarring and confusing transition  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
