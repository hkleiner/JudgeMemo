Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein / a son is / born and / there is / great rejoicing" disrupts natural flow.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the fragmented lines "Wherein / a son is / born and / there is / great rejoicing" creates confusion.  
- [LEXICON] Repetition of "was" in "She was filled with joy... she was filled with fear" is redundant.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The orders of an Emperor waited" is passive and awkward; could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The fragmented lines "Wherein / a son is / born and / there is / great rejoicing" disrupt the narrative flow and logical progression.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift from the birth of the child to the mention of Miss Porter and the mission doctor is abrupt and lacks clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Yen compound" and "Chang An" is unclear without prior context, making the connection to Kuei Pingâ€™s situation confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the birth of the child to the arrival of Chang An is abrupt and lacks explanation or connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the devious ways of tongue and ear" is vague and does not clearly explain how news traveled.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
