Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It seems as if six shirts at one time must mean something out o’ the common!" (contraction "o’" is inconsistent with the rest of the text's formal tone)  
- [SPELLING] "out o’ the common" (informal contraction "o’" is jarring and inconsistent with the rest of the text)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had the wit and wisdom to put her affliction quite out of the question, and allude only to her sacrifice in marrying a blind man, hopelessly and helplessly dependent on her sweet offices for the rest of his life, if she, in her womanly mercy, would love him and help him bear his burdens." (long, complex sentence with multiple clauses is difficult to follow)  
- [LEXICON] "ministered unto by Lyddy’s kind hands" (archaic phrasing "unto" is inconsistent with the rest of the text's style)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "If God had smitten these two with one hand, he had held out the other in tender benediction." (missing comma after "If God had smitten these two with one hand" for clarity)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Anthony making six shirts to the description of his and Lyddy's emotional connection is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between descriptions of Anthony and Lyddy's relationship, their daily activities, and the symbolic meaning of Anthony's musical work without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Anthony's musical process with wires and wooden pegs is somewhat confusing and lacks sufficient explanation for a casual reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the emotional scene of Anthony and Lyddy's proposal to the detailed description of Anthony's musical process is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The symbolic interpretation of Anthony's music by Davy and Lyddy is somewhat abstract and not clearly connected to the preceding narrative.
