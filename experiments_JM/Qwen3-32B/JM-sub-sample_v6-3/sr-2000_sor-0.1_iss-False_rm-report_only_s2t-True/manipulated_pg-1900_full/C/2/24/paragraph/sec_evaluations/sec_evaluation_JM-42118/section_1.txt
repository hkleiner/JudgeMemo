Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the AI assistant adjusted the lights" (out of context and disrupts narrative flow).  
- [SPELLING] "pleasaunces" is an archaic or misspelled word, possibly intended as "pleasures" or "pleasantries."  
- [GRAMMAR] "the eleven-year-old boy's ears heard of the death of the minister" is grammatically awkward and unclear.  
- [LEXICON] "attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards" is overly complex and confusing.  
- [SYNTAX] "the small boy with the big head was born in the year after Fran√ßois Boucher came back to Paris from his Italian wanderings on the eve of his thirties and won to academic honour" is a run-on sentence with poor structure.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sudden mention of "The AI assistant adjusted the lights" is jarring and disrupts the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the boy's childhood to the political gossip is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about the Pompadour and her influence is dense and lacks clear progression, making it difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the boy's life in Grasse to the political events in Paris is abrupt and lacks contextual linkage.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle and its implications is not clearly tied to the boy's development or the narrative.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
