Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "The power through which these goals will be progressively realized is that of unity."  
- [SPELLING] "disease sapping" should be "disease sapping" (no issue), but "sapping" is correct. No spelling errors detected.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and complex vocabulary may hinder readability for some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "Bahá'ís" in "Although to Bahá'ís the most obvious of truths..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the Bahá'í community's achievements to the concept of spiritual influences without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final chapter ("A corollary of the abandonment of faith in God...") is abrupt and disconnected from the preceding content.  
- [CLARITY] The argument about the Bahá'í community's unity and its spiritual basis is complex and could benefit from clearer transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between the section on the Bahá'í community and the final chapter.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
