2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." (Irrelevant and out of context)  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the author's attempts to gain access to the war zone to a detailed description of the Marne battlefield without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The author's frustration with the bureaucratic process is clear, but the resolution feels abrupt and lacks a clear conclusion.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Verdun, Nancy, Rheims and Thann" is introduced without clear connection to the previous narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the battlefield of the Marne feels disconnected from the preceding bureaucratic narrative.
