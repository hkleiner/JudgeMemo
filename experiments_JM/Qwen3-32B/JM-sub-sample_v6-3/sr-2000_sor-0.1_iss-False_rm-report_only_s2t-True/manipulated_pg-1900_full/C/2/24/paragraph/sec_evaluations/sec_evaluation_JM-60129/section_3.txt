- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from detailed cultural descriptions to unrelated technological references.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from describing cultural practices to the statistical table is abrupt and lacks explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the statistical data and its potential falsification is somewhat disconnected from the preceding cultural descriptions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially when moving from one cultural practice to another.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "tshokh" is unclear and not defined, which may confuse readers.
