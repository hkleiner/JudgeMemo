Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Lewd libidinous fantasies, X stands for nothing for nothing for nothing, XXX--she got nowhere."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation in "But beyond that point, she could dream only of proto-man and his secret."  
- [SPELLING] "thousand-tonner" is a non-standard term and may confuse readers.  
- [LEXICON] "The home assistant played ambient music" is an anachronistic or out-of-place phrase in the context.  
- [SYNTAX] "The Enterprise...." is an incomplete sentence.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the Enterprise's blastoff to Garr Symm's dialogue aboard the Dog Star without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly moves between the Enterprise and the Dog Star without clear indication of the timeline or spatial relationship.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of hyper-space and its relationship to time is introduced in a confusing and repetitive manner.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Ramsey's explanation of hyper-space to the Enterprise's movement is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the home assistant played ambient music" is out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.
