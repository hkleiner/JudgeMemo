- [SYNTAX] "The enlisted men of both armies, however, remained largely unaware of the strategy of their commanders." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The romantic and heroic exploits were relatively few, and between them came long stretches of uninspiring and backbreaking routine." (redundant phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A touchscreen panel showed static." (irrelevant and disrupts narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] "A soundbar adjusted volume automatically." (irrelevant and disrupts narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed military operations and unrelated, anachronistic technological references, breaking the logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed military history to the section about "special artists" is abrupt and lacks context.
