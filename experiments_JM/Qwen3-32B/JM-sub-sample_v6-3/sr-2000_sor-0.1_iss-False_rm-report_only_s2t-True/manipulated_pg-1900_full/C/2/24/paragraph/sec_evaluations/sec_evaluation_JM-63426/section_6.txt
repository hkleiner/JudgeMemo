Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A tablet lit up on the table." – unclear reference and grammatically awkward.  
- [SYNTAX] "forms were lifted from the presses and transferred to the University Press at Cambridge" – awkward phrasing.  
- [LEXICON] "I had waded far beyond my depth" – slightly informal and unclear in context.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "and also the employment of an additional pressman and two additional feeders, and keeping the presses running nights as well as days" – run-on sentence with missing punctuation.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the growth of the Wayside Press to the Christmas number of Century magazine without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events and time periods without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] "A tablet lit up on the table." – unclear reference and disconnected from the surrounding narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the business struggles to the interlude in New York is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the Christmas number of Century feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
