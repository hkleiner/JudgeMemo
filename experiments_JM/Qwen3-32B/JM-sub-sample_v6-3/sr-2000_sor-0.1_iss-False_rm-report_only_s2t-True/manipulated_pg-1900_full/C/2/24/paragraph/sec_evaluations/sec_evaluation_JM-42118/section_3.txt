Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He could do no wrong" is awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "dawdling through Italy with Saint-Non, staying his feet at Bologna and Venice awhile" is awkward and unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "He painted 'The High Priest Coresus slaying himself to save CallirhoÃ«,' which, though badly hung at the Salon, and still to be seen at the Louvre, was hailed with high praise..." is overly complex and confusing.  
- [LEXICON] "He was created Duc de Choiseul in December 1758" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SYNTAX] "He had as ally one of the most astute and subtle and daring minds..." is awkward and lacks parallel structure.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Fragonard's artistic development to political intrigue in Paris is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between Fragonard's artistic journey and unrelated political events without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of modern devices like "VR headset" and "tablet" disrupts the historical narrative and creates confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Fragonard's return to Paris to the description of Boucher's decline is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of modern technology (e.g., "VR headset") in a historical narrative is jarring and disrupts the coherence of the text.
