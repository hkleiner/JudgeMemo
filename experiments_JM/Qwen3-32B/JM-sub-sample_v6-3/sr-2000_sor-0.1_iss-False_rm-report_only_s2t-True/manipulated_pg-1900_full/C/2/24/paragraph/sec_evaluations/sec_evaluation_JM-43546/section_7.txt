1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Donald and Sandy wore jackets made of the celebrated 'Harris tweeds,' which have a queer smoky smell which comes from their being made..." (repetition of "which").  
- [GRAMMAR] "The 'crofters' are those who live in tiny houses built of rough stone, and their principal occupation and industry is the weaving..." (subject-verb agreement error: "is" should be "are").  
- [GRAMMAR] "For this reason the genuine Harris tweed always smells smoky." (missing article "the" before "genuine Harris tweed").  
- [GRAMMAR] "Donald and Sandy wore jackets made of the celebrated 'Harris tweeds,' which have a queer smoky smell which comes from their being made..." (awkward phrasing and redundancy).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The boys were on the lookout, and Don soon spied it on its high hill rising above the trees." (awkward phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "Yes, so that they could be more easily protected, and also that a watch could be kept over many miles of country, in order to guard against any surprise by an enemy." (awkward phrasing and redundancy).  
- [GRAMMAR] "Over yonder lies the Field of Bannockburn, where was fought one of the greatest battles..." (awkward phrasing; "where was fought" is non-standard).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The little girls were great favourites in the village, and Marjorie stopped to tell everybody about her presents." (awkward phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "Around him were his sheep, which were carefully watched by three fine collie dogs, who marched around the flock, and kept them in order, as an officer does his soldiers." (awkward phrasing and redundancy).  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was a tiny cottage of rough stones, with a roof also made of flat stones..." (awkward phrasing).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the train journey to the arrival at Skylemore Station is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the description of the train journey to the birthday celebration the next morning is abrupt and lacks clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of "Auld Wullie" and the collies feels disconnected from the previous narrative about the train and the arrival at Skylemore.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the birthday celebration to the visit with "Auld Wullie" is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the fancy-dress party at the end is introduced suddenly and lacks a smooth transition from the previous events.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the visit with "Auld Wullie" to the afternoon preparations for the party without clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of the "tewky" as a gift is somewhat confusing due to the lack of prior context about what a "tewky" is.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the "shepherd's plaid" is inserted abruptly and lacks integration with the surrounding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The explanation of the sheep-dogs' contest is introduced without clear connection to the previous narrative about "Auld Wullie."  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the fancy-dress party is introduced without clear transition from the previous events.
