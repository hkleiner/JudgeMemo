Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "We sat on one of these seats while the dummy was viewed--page by page--twice." (awkward phrasing with excessive dashes)  
- [SYNTAX] "There I was shown a wire evidently written and sent as soon as I had left." (passive voice and unclear structure)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [LEXICON] "I reveled in an opportunity to apply the suggestions presented in the report." (somewhat informal tone for a professional context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "And now there is little more to tell, unless you want to listen to the way I enthuse..." (awkward transition and informal phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A trip to Chicago was not necessary, there being an obvious change long overdue..." (sudden shift in focus without clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Chicago trip to the report and its implications is abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] "Mr. Long read the report--thoughtfully, I believe--talked with his art editors..." (interrupted sentence structure disrupts flow)  
- [TRANSITION] "And now there is little more to tell, unless you want to listen to the way I enthuse..." (sudden shift in tone and content)  
- [LOGIC] "But upon my return to New York after many years in California I think my greatest thrill came..." (sudden shift to a new topic without clear connection)
