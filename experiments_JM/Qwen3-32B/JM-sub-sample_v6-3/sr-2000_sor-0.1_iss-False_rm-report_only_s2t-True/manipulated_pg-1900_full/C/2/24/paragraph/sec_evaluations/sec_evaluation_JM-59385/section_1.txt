Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it" (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [SYNTAX] "crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" (unclear meaning and awkward syntax)  
- [SPELLING] "tapestried" (likely a misspelling of "tapestried")  
- [SYNTAX] "Kuei Ping caught herself thinking, and then flushed at what she thought her irreverence" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the pleasure of their honorable guests" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "the coming alliance with an official family was not beyond the knowledge of Wong Lui" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the care with which they had been selected and to pay homage in memory to the experience and knowledge which made possible that rare power of choice" (awkward phrasing and complex structure)

- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the jewelry shop scene to the memory of the mission school graduation  
- [CLARITY] Unclear purpose of the "Lend light, lend light" phrase and its relevance to the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] The memory of the mission school is introduced without clear transition or foreshadowing  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the mission school graduation feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative about the Street of Precious Pearls
