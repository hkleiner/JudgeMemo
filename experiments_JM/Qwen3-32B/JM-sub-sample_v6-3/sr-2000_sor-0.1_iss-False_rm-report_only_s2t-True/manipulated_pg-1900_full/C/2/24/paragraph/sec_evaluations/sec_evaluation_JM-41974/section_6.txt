Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "But for that matter there is not a room..." - [SPELLING] "Venice Upon the Terrestrial Globe, Between Justice and Peace" lacks proper punctuation - [GRAMMAR] "It is believed that the canvas now in the Museum at Berlin..." has a missing comma - [LEXICON] "The indefatigable artist endeavoured to satisfy them all" uses "endeavoured" in a slightly archaic way that feels out of place - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long descriptive phrases like "Veronese's celebrity, about the year 1580, had become world-wide"

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing Veronese's works in the Palace of the Doges to the Fondaco dei Tedeschi without clear transition - [LOGIC] Jump from discussing Veronese's international fame to his artistic style without connecting the ideas - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing Veronese's works to his death without clear chronological markers - [CLARITY] The final paragraph about Veronese's death and legacy feels disconnected from the detailed discussion of his works - [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different locations (Venice, Verona, France) without clear organization

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
