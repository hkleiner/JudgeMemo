Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A voice command triggered automation" is a sentence fragment and lacks context.  
- [SYNTAX] "If people whose beliefs appear to be fundamentally different from one's own nevertheless live moral lives that deserve admiration, what is it that makes one's own faith superior to theirs?" is overly complex and difficult to parse.  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh" and "Bahá'í" are correctly spelled, but the text contains many religious and cultural terms that may be challenging for some readers.  
- [LEXICON] "The shout hath been raised, and the people have come forth from their graves, and arising, are gazing around them." uses archaic language that may be confusing to modern readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences are long and lack appropriate punctuation to aid readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the section on spiritual development to the section on the dilemma of the world order is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between abstract philosophical ideas and concrete examples without clear signposting, making it difficult to follow the overall argument.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "A voice command triggered automation" is out of context and disrupts the flow of the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the role of religion in history to the challenges of modernity is not clearly articulated, leading to a disjointed reading experience.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text references religious figures and scriptures without providing sufficient background for readers unfamiliar with the context.
