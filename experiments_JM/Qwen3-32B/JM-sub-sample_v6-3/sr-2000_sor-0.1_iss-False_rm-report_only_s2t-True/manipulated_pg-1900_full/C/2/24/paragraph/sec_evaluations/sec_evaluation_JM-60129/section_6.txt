2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant mention of "The e-ink wallpaper changed patterns."  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptions of geography, social structure, and historical documents without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] Some terms like "t'umu," "fu-fumu," and "ta t'umu" are not clearly explained for a general reader  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the t'umu's house to the broader tribal history is abrupt  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The e-ink wallpaper changed patterns" is completely disconnected from the rest of the text and disrupts the narrative flow
