Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The laser display turned off automatically" and "A speech recognition unit recorded everything"  
- [LEXICON] Sudden shift in register with the inclusion of technical phrases like "laser display" and "speech recognition unit" in a predominantly theological text  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistency in "Islám" and "Islám" (though not an error, it is inconsistent)  
- [SYNTAX] Slightly awkward phrasing in "One of the most cherished of the Qur'án's surihs takes up the metaphor"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained insertion of technical phrases like "laser display" and "speech recognition unit" disrupts the logical flow of the theological discussion  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from theological content to technical descriptions without clear connection or explanation  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" is unclear in context and does not logically follow the preceding theological discussion  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from a deep theological analysis to seemingly random technical mentions, creating a disjointed reading experience  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
