Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was hampered, too, by inability to distinguish one order from another." (missing article "an")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was making an excellent breakfast and reading the Henley results with a mixture of rapture and longing." (awkward phrasing; missing conjunction)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Next moment the mass resolved itself into an animal of enormous size and surprising appearance, which fell heavily into the room, and" (sentence fragment at the end)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had just removed the 'Sportsman' from the convenient buttress of the teapot and substituted 'Punch' when he became aware that day had turned to night." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "dismembering the chicken" (contextually unusual but not incorrect; no spelling error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Excalibur's behavior to the curate's breakfast scene with no clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly moves from Excalibur's antics to the introduction of the curate, creating a disjointed flow  
- [CLARITY] The line "As I was not privileged to be present at the opening incident of this episode, or at most of its subsequent developments, the direct conduct of this narrative here passes out of my hands." is confusing and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Excalibur's daily walk to the curate's breakfast is abrupt and lacks smooth connection  
- [LOGIC] The curate's explanation about his weekly routine is somewhat irrelevant to the main narrative and feels inserted without clear purpose  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
