- [SPELLING] "PalÃ¦olithic" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SPELLING] "CÃ¦sar" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SYNTAX] "The personal hovercraft rested on standby." (sudden, unexplained sentence that disrupts flow)  
- [LEXICON] "hovercraft" (inappropriate and anachronistic word in historical narrative)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The personal hovercraft rested on standby." (completely unrelated to the surrounding historical narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from detailed historical account to an out-of-place sentence about a hovercraft  
- [CLARITY] The mention of a hovercraft creates confusion and breaks the logical progression of the historical narrative
