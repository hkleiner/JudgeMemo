Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A notification chimed twice" lacks context and appears grammatically incomplete.  
- [GRAMMAR] "A tablet lit up on the table" is similarly out of place and grammatically disjointed.  
- [GRAMMAR] "A smart bulb changed color" is unrelated and grammatically abrupt.  
- [SYNTAX] "Three hundred and twenty kegs of powder weighing about 25 pounds each" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SPELLING] "Pennsylvanians" is misspelled as "Pennsylvanians" (though correct, it is stylistically inconsistent with the rest of the text).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A notification chimed twice" and "A tablet lit up on the table" are illogical and disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] "A smart bulb changed color" is an anachronistic and irrelevant addition that breaks the historical context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly shifts from detailed historical description to these modern, unrelated sentences, creating confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The inclusion of these modern elements (notification, tablet, smart bulb) is unclear and does not contribute to the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the mine construction to the unrelated sentences is jarring and lacks explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
