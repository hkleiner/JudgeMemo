Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A camera lens refocused itself."  
- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing in "A machine-learning model updated itself."  
- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing in "A voice command triggered automation."  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling error in "Caliari" (should be "Veronese" or "Paolo" for consistency in some contexts).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant mention of "A machine-learning model updated itself" disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Similarly, "A voice command triggered automation" is an anachronistic and illogical insertion.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Veronese's personality to unrelated technological phrases.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Caliari" instead of "Veronese" in some parts may confuse the reader.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
