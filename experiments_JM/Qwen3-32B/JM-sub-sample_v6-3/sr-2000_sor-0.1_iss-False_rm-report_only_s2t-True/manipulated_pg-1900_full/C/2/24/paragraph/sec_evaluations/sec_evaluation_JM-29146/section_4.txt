Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was still holding the Vegan girl's slender arm, though." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Ramsey took the gun. Their hands met." (sudden shift in focus without transition)  
- [LEXICON] "Ramsey packed a few things in an expanduffle" (unfamiliar or misspelled word)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The cold dark night awaiting them with a fierce howling wind and the first flurries of snow from the north." (missing punctuation for clarity)  
- [SPELLING] "expanduffle" (likely a typo or neologism not used in standard English)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey kissing Margot to the Vegan girl trying to run away (confusing cause-effect)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from the kiss to Ramsey blushing and then to Margot putting on her cloak (lack of smooth transition)  
- [CLARITY] "Ramsey packed a few things in an expanduffle" (unclear what an "expanduffle" is, affecting comprehension)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the kiss to the next scene is abrupt and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The letter's content is introduced without prior setup, making it feel like an information dump  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
