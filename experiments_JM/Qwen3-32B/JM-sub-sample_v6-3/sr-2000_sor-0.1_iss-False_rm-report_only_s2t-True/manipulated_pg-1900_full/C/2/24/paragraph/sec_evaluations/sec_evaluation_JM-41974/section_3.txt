Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The smart paper displayed new text."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A thermal sensor picked up movement."  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent tone with modern-sounding phrases like "The smart paper displayed new text" and "A thermal sensor picked up movement" in an otherwise historical narrative.  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling error: "Lo Schiavone" vs. "Lo Schiavene" later in the text.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained insertion of "The smart paper displayed new text" disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Similarly, "A thermal sensor picked up movement" is out of place and unrelated to the surrounding content.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is otherwise well-structured, but the two inserted sentences create jarring discontinuities.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of the text is generally clear, but the two inserted sentences confuse the reader and break the immersion in the historical context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
