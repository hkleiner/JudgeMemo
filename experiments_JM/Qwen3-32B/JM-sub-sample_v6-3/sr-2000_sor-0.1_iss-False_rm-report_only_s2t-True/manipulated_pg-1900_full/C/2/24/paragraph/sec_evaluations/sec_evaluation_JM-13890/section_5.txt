Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Henry was now quite absolved, but he remained for the whole night with his bare feet still muddy and in the same penitential garb." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.)  
- [SYNTAX] "Not by that way only did the vast crowds reach Canterbury..." (Inversion of subject and verb is archaic and disrupts natural flow.)  
- [LEXICON] "poured into the Cathedral coffers" (Slightly awkward phrasing; "poured" is imprecise in this context.)  
- [SPELLING] "Scarcely two months after Henry's penance the splendid choir of the Cathedral caught fire..." (Missing comma after introductory phrase.)  
- [SYNTAX] "He set to work soon after the fire; but, after four years of labour, was so much injured by a fall from the scaffolding..." (Awkward structure and missing subject.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "To one or both of these architects is due the unusual device..." (Passive voice is awkward and disrupts clarity.)  
- [SYNTAX] "When the whole of the east end of the cathedral was finished, nearly two centuries elapsed before any further change took place beyond the beginning of the chapter-house." (Awkward phrasing and complex structure.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The martyrdom took place on December 29, but owing to the time of the year this festival did not draw so many as the summer one." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.)  
- [SYNTAX] "And even if this dignity had not remained the position of the town in relation to the comings and goings between England and France would have saved it from any sudden fall from its opulence and greatness before the dissolution." (Very long and complex sentence with unclear structure.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "To touch even lightly on the subsequent history of Canterbury is not possible here..." (Awkward phrasing and passive voice.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Henry's penance to the description of Canterbury's cathedral and its history is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical periods and events without clear transitions or signposting.  
- [CLARITY] The description of architectural styles and rebuilding efforts is dense and difficult to follow without prior knowledge.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical narrative to the description of the city's current appearance is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Dr. Cox's book and the author's personal reflection feels disconnected from the preceding historical narrative.
