Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A hologram displayed the weather" is a sentence fragment and lacks context.  
- [SPELLING] "drouth" is an archaic or misspelled form of "drought."  
- [SYNTAX] "One of the members of Nolanâ€™s expedition; was captured by Lieut. Musquiz..." has incorrect punctuation and structure.  
- [LEXICON] "negro" is an outdated and potentially offensive term.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "A hologram displayed the weather" is abrupt and unrelated to the surrounding historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between unrelated historical topics (e.g., the Old Stone Fort, missions, cemeteries, and a modern hologram) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "A hologram displayed the weather" disrupts the historical flow and lacks explanation or relevance.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical account of Peter Ellis Bean to the unrelated "A hologram displayed the weather" is jarring and unexplained.
