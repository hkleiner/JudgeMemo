Evaluation Form:

- [SPELLING] "fourpence-halfpenny" (uncommon term that may be distracting)
- [SYNTAX] "As he was to preside at a lecture I was delivering he had in his courtesy invited me to dinner" (run-on sentence)
- [LEXICON] "trifle with literature" (ambiguous phrasing)
- [PUNCTUATION] "He was an admirable chairman, for he occupied no time with a review of literature in his address, and he slept without being noticed through mine (which is all I ask of a chairman)" (awkward parenthetical placement)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing bookmen to a robotic hand adjusting controls ("A robotic hand adjusted the controls")
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition between the anecdote about the colonial squatter and the discussion of detective stories
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "this bushman" in the context of the colonial squatter story
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing the colonial squatter to "There are those who buy their right to citizenship..."
