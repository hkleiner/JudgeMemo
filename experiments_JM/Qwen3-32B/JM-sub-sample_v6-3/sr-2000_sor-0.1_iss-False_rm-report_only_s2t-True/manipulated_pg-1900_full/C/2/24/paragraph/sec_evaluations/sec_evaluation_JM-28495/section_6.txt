Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "He is going to London, my beloved, to lay the foundations of Paradise for you and me--for you and me!" (repetition of "for you and me") - [PUNCTUATION] "No," she said; "nicer not." (incorrect use of semicolon) - [SPELLING] "lumbering and ill-balanced" (awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "A diagnostic tool scanned the network." (out of context and grammatically disconnected) - [LEXICON] "He is going to visit friends in the north." (vague and unclear reference)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] "A diagnostic tool scanned the network." (completely out of context and disrupts the narrative flow) - [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Eileen's conversation with the curate to Excalibur's journey to London with no clear transition - [STRUCTURE] The chapter ends abruptly with a reference to "Destiny" without resolution or explanation - [CLARITY] "He is going to visit friends in the north." (unclear who "he" refers to and what the connection is)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
