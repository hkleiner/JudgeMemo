Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We may regard these two processes, external and internal, as so far, of like physical order."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous or overly abstract word choice in "A surveillance camera moved slightly."  
- [GRAMMAR] Unclear subject-verb agreement in "Of course this statement is open to question."  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "In any given case they further imply, through heredity-relatedness, the evolutionary history of the organism in which they obtain."  
- [SPELLING] Possible typo or unclear term "heredity-relatedness" (though could be intentional).  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and nested clauses in "The existing orbital motion at any moment implies, too, the preceding motion which it has, in a sense, inherited from the past."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in topic with "A surveillance camera moved slightly" without clear connection to prior discussion.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from physiological processes to gravitational knowledge without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear distinction between "physico-chemical" and "vital" processes in the context of cognition.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the discussion of heredity and the gravitational analogy.  
- [LOGIC] Ambiguity in the concept of "gravitative knowledge" and its relevance to the main argument.  
- [CLARITY] Confusing use of "awareness" and "knowledge" without clear definitions or differentiation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
