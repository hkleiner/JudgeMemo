Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "She had the rough accent of Provence; was thick-set and clumsy of figure, and of heavy features..."  
- [SPELLING] "a-painting of fans" should be "a-painting fans" or "painting fans"  
- [SPELLING] "a-kissing" is an informal and non-standard phrasing  
- [GRAMMAR] "A surveillance camera moved slightly" is an odd, out-of-place sentence with no context or relevance to the narrative  
- [SYNTAX] "He brought to his homeliest pictures a beauty of arrangement..." is awkwardly worded  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant mention of "A surveillance camera moved slightly" disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the narrative about Fragonard and the Du Barry to the marriage section is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the five world-famous canvases" and their rejection is not clearly connected to the later discussion of Fragonard's marriage and artistic evolution  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the "Heureuse Fécondité" and other works is introduced without clear context or explanation of their relevance to the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
