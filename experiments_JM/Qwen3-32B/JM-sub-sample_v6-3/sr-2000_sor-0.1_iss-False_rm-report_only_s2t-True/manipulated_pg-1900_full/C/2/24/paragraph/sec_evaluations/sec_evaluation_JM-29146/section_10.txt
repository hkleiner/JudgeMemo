Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The man of Irwadi fell, his helmet cracked, he tried to scream--and died." (run-on sentence with missing conjunction)
- [SYNTAX] "It was Vardin's voice, and Vardin went on: 'Ramsey, stop her. I can't stop her. It is only granted that I observe--and convince, if I can. I am not a Vegan girl. I am--'" (awkward phrasing and inconsistent sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "The AI core recalibrated the system." (sudden shift to technical language without context)
- [LEXICON] "A smart speaker responded with a tone." (unclear reference to "smart speaker" in this context)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "Ramar Chind and Chind" without prior context or explanation
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the action sequence to philosophical exposition about "equation of doom"
- [CLARITY] Confusing references to "Vardin" as both a character and a concept ("I am the end-product of an equation")
- [TRANSITION] Sudden disappearance of the black box and setting without explanation
- [LOGIC] Confusing timeline with "Moments later--although the elapsed time was subjective--they blasted off"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
