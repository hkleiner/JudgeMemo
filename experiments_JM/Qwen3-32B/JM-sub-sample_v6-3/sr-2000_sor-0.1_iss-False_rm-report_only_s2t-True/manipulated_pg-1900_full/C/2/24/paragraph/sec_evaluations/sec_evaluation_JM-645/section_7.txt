Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The drone docked without issue." (awkward phrasing; "without issue" is unclear in this context)  
- [SYNTAX] "I can certainly not be said to have sat down, for I seem to remember myself at this time as rattling constantly between the little house in Chelsea and my own." (cumbersome and confusing sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He’ll write it.” / “He’ll come right home—this will bring him.” (inconsistent use of "he" and "him" may cause confusion)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had found Mr. Vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret a real intoxication." (missing comma after "interesting" for clarity)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The drone docked without issue." (sudden and irrelevant mention of a drone disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the main narrative to the drone docking is abrupt and unexplained  
- [CLARITY] "He’ll write it.” / “He’ll come right home—this will bring him.” (unclear reference to "he" and "it" without sufficient context)  
- [TRANSITION] "I can certainly not be said to have sat down, for I seem to remember myself at this time as rattling constantly between the little house in Chelsea and my own." (jarring shift in perspective and time)  
- [LOGIC] "He had found Mr. Vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret a real intoxication." (unclear connection between "possession of the secret" and "intoxication")
