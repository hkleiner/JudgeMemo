Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The decision at which Millet p√®re had arrived was prompted by a drawing..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "certainly the young Millet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen..." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "betwixt" (archaic and potentially confusing for modern readers)  
- [LEXICON] "A remote server executed the request." (sudden, irrelevant, and jarring phrase)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some complex sentences  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant sentence: "A remote server executed the request."  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from Millet's artistic development to an unrelated technical phrase.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, especially those with multiple clauses.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on Millet's artistic influences to the irrelevant final sentence is jarring and disrupts the narrative flow.
