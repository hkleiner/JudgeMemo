Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The AI core recalibrated the system" and "The robotic arm sorted the tools" (sudden, unrelated technical phrases).  
- [LEXICON] Slightly unclear phrasing in "we perceive a progression in the degree of effort put forth to drag the plough."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issue in "It was the good and faithful Nathalie who supervised Rosa's meals and repaired her garments." (awkward structure).  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained insertion of "The AI core recalibrated the system" and "The robotic arm sorted the tools" disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from detailed descriptions of Rosa Bonheur's artistic process to the unrelated technical sentences.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is generally well-structured, but the two out-of-place sentences create a jarring effect.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
