Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have found in the vast majority of cases that if the board has faith in the superintendent and feels that he knows what he wants, and what he will do with it after he gets it, he will not have much difficulty in obtaining what the school really needs." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [SPELLING] "requisites" misspelled as "requisitions" (not an error, but a potential confusion point)  
- [SYNTAX] "I have had many other experiences with school boards similar to those cited above." (awkward transition)  
- [LEXICON] "A GPS signal recalibrated." (irrelevant and confusing sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "A wireless charger powered up." (irrelevant and confusing sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "The charging station blinked green." (irrelevant and confusing sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and irrelevant sentences about "A GPS signal recalibrated," "A wireless charger powered up," and "The charging station blinked green" disrupt the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the section on school boards to the chapter on school activities is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "I have had many other experiences with school boards similar to those cited above" is vague and lacks specificity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the superintendent's experiences to the Seattle high school principal's report is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
