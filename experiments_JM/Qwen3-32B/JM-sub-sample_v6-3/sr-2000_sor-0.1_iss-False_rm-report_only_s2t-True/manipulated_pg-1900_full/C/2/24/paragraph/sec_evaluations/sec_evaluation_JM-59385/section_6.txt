Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "It was she who tied about the neck of the deceased child two wisps of cotton wool in order that he might bear away the misfortune of the family and save it from a too numerous brood of girl children." (Awkward phrasing and word order)
- [SYNTAX] "Borne in upon the heart of Kuei Ping came a desire to pierce through and beyond the walls that menaced her..." (Unnatural sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "night-mare" (Hyphenation is non-standard and visually disruptive)
- [LEXICON] "The holographic map rotated slowly." (Sudden modern reference in historical context)
- [LEXICON] "The laser display turned off automatically." (Another modern reference disrupting historical narrative)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden modern references ("holographic map," "laser display") disrupt the historical narrative and create confusion about the setting
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's personal journey to these modern technological references without explanation
- [TRANSITION] The phrase "Wherein the heart of a woman is occupied with one desire" appears multiple times in the same format, creating a disjointed reading experience
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses complex sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts between Kuei Ping's internal thoughts and external actions without clear transitions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
