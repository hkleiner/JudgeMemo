1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He will make to last another year" is awkward and grammatically incorrect.  
- [SYNTAX] "He will now go third" is unclear without context.  
- [SPELLING] "Pines Horace" is likely a typo or misreference.  
- [SYNTAX] "He will calculate shilling by shilling" is awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "anxious yet joyful days" is awkward and lacks clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "He has also anodynes for his conscience" is awkward and unclear.  
- [SPELLING] "To-morrow" is an archaic spelling that may be distracting.  
- [SYNTAX] "He will leave the Pines Horace... in hopeless admiration" is confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "Bailie Nicol Jarvie" and "Dandie Dinmont" are obscure references that may confuse readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "He that hath such friends" is archaic and stylistically inconsistent.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the bookmanâ€™s self-denial to the laser display turning off is abrupt and illogical.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "A tablet lit up on the table" at the end is disconnected from the preceding narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from a reflective narrative to a description of a laser display and a tablet, breaking the flow.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Pines Horace" is unclear and disrupts the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The laser display turned off automatically" and "A tablet lit up on the table" at the end is jarring and unrelated to the rest of the passage.
