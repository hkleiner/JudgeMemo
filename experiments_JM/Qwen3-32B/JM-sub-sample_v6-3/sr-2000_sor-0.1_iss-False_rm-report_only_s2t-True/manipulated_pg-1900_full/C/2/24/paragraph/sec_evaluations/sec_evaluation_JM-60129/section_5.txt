Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "were grouped the majority of them low and of the most unpretentious description" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "your eye was caught at once by a temple-like building, which is used by the monastery" (mismatched tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The pressure door hissed as it sealed" (unclear and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the lamas scarlet mantles, highcombed head dresses, staffs and other insignia were lying" (missing article and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "On the hill-side nearest the monastery some tombs were marked by high poles and heaps of stones" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Only a small percentage of the lamas are able to read the Tangutan language, they have nothing to do with medicine" (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had succeeded the last Shke lama, who died eight or nine years ago, but was only brought to K'anglungssu for the solemnizing of great ceremonies, occuring every sixth and twelfth Chinese moon" (awkward phrasing and missing hyphen in "occurring")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The gegen of the monastery, their Shke lama (Great Lama) Buddha's reincarnation, was still a child" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The sunburnt grass had in the sunshine a warm sandstone colour against which the grey mountain ridge with its dark border of fir-trees stood out effectively" (awkward phrasing and word order)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of the monastery and the author's personal experiences without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the temple and its contents is detailed but lacks a clear organizational structure, making it difficult to follow the spatial layout.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms and names (e.g., "t'umu," "Shke lama," "Tangutan") are not clearly explained, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the monastery to the author's departure is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph describing the landscape and departure is disconnected from the earlier detailed descriptions of the monastery.
