2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from Fragonard's artistic career to political events in France, with little transition or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Fragonard's personal life, political events, and the rise of Madame du Barry, making it difficult to follow a clear thread.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Jesuits" and their conflict with "Choiseul" is not clearly explained, making the political context confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Fragonard's work to the political events surrounding the king and Madame du Barry is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the Jesuit priest raising his glass To the Presentation!" is unclear in context and lacks explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the new Esther" and "Haman" is metaphorical and not clearly explained, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from one anecdote to another without clear progression or unifying theme.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Fragonard's artistic career and the political events in France is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Presentation" and the political toast is unclear and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the priest and Madame du Barry feels disconnected from the earlier discussion of Fragonard's work.
