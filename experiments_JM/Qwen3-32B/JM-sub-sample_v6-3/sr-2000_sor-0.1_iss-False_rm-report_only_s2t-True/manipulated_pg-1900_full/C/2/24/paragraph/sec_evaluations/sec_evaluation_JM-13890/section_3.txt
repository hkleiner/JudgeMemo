Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "The drone docked without issue" – abrupt and out of context reference to a drone.  
- [LEXICON] "The solar drone adjusted its altitude" – similarly, the mention of a solar drone is jarring and unrelated to the historical narrative.  
- [LEXICON] "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions" – modern and irrelevant term that disrupts the flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the King on this side of the water" – unclear phrasing and awkward syntax.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the King over the water" – repeated awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the sea again come between me and my Church" – missing auxiliary verb ("will" or "shall").  
- [GRAMMAR] "the King on this side of the water" – inconsistent phrasing with earlier "the King over the water."  
- [GRAMMAR] "the King over the water commands you to perform your duty to the King on this side of the water" – confusing and redundant phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the sea again come between me and my Church, unless I am dragged thence by the feet" – missing modal verb.  
- [LEXICON] "A robotic hand adjusted the controls" – modern and irrelevant reference.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained references to "drones," "deepfake filters," and "robotic hands" disrupt the historical narrative and create confusion.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a detailed historical account to modern technological references without any logical connection or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is interrupted by these jarring modern elements, breaking the flow and coherence of the historical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The presence of anachronistic elements (e.g., drones, robotic hands) makes it difficult to follow the intended historical storyline.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between the historical events and the modern references are abrupt and lack any logical or thematic connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
