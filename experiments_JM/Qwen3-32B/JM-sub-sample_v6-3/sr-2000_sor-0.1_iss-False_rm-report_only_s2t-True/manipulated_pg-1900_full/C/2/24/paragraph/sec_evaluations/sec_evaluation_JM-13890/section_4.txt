Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Taking up such an attitude in front of four men who had come hot-foot to Canterbury with the express determination to seek an excuse for killing him, Becket was sealing his own fate." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The fear of sacrilege induced the knights to try to drag the defenceless Archbishop out of the Cathedral, but he struggled with such vigour, flinging one of the men down on the stone floor, that they gave up the attempt and killed him with three or four sword strokes, the last of which, as he lay prone, was delivered by Richard le Bret, or the Breton, and so tremendous was the force with which it was delivered that the crown of the head was severed from the skull and the sword broke in two on the pavement." (Cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate with the practices of medieval monasticism." (Word choice is awkward and unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Such austerity had hitherto been unknown to English saints, and the marvel was increased by the sight--to our notions so revolting--of the innumerable vermin with which the hair-cloth abounded--boiling over with them, as one account describes it, like water in a simmering cauldron." (Overuse of em dashes disrupts flow)  
- [SPELLING] "defenceless" (British spelling is consistent, but may be considered a minor issue in an American context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate with the practices of medieval monasticism." (Sudden shift in narrative voice and unclear relevance to the main story)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the murder of Becket to the immediate canonization and the monks' reaction is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.  
- [CLARITY] "Roger had been specially chosen to guard this relic, but he succumbed to the temptation offered by the rival establishment outside the city walls, and having purloined the coveted fragment of the martyr, was duly installed in the highest office of St. Augustine's." (Confusing sentence structure and unclear cause-effect relationship)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the murder to the pilgrims and relics is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative bridge.  
- [LOGIC] "It was a wet day, but being in the month of July the wearing of a shirt only with a cloak to keep off the rain could not have been the cause of very great physical discomfort apart from the cutting of his feet by stones on the road." (Tangential and irrelevant to the main narrative)
