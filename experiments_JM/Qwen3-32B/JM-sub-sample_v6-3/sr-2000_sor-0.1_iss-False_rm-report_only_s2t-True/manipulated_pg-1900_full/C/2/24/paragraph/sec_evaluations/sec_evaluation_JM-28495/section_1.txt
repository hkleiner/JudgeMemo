(Awkward phrasing) - [SPELLING] "pedigrees were inclosed" (Incorrect word choice, should be "enclosed") - [SYNTAX] "The advertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four months, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year." (Awkward punctuation and structure) - [LEXICON] "dernier cri" (Uncommon term may confuse some readers) - [PUNCTUATION] "I coughed and answered evasively:--" (Unnecessary em dash)

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear transitions - [LOGIC] The decision-making process about the dog is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner - [CLARITY] The purpose of the Battersea tram ride is not immediately clear at the beginning - [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing dog breeds to actually going to the Home for Lost Dogs is abrupt - [CONTEXT] References to "Much Moreham" and other locations are mentioned without explanation
