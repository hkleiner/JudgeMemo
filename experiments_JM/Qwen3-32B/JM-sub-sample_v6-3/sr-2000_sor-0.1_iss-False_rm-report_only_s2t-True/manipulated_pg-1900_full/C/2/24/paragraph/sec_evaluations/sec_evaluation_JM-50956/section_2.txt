Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A data stream flowed uninterrupted" is a grammatically incomplete and awkward phrase.  
- [SPELLING] "sonov" is likely a typo or incomplete word.  
- [SYNTAX] "i. e., 80,000 men--the 1st and the 6th Russian Army Corps." has awkward punctuation and structure.  
- [LEXICON] "sanguine World struggle" uses "sanguine" incorrectly; it should be "sanguinary" or "bloody."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation in phrases like "etc., etc."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The phrase "A data stream flowed uninterrupted" is out of context and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing the Tannenberg battle to a vague and disconnected statement about data streams.  
- [CLARITY] The final sentence "This creates the impression..." is unclear in its connection to the preceding paragraph.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the analysis of the Tannenberg battle to the mention of "data stream" is jarring and lacks explanation.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text oscillates between detailed historical analysis and vague, unrelated statements, reducing overall consistency.
