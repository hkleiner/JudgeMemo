Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He designated it as X" lacks parallel structure with the previous sentence.  
- [SYNTAX] "He did not like letting Margot know how he felt about her, but it was mostly on a straight physical level" is awkward and unclear.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [LEXICON] "A storage cloud expanded its archive" is unclear and possibly misused phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "He designated it as X" is abrupt and lacks explanation.  
- [SYNTAX] "X marks the spot, thought Ramsey. XXX marks the spot-spot-spot." is repetitive and stylistically awkward.  
- [SYNTAX] "X is a spot in a pot or a lot of rot" is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "Ramar Chind shrugged resignedly and lisped" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SYNTAX] "You'll be going with me--on the most important assignment you or any Irwadian ever had" is awkward and lacks parallelism.

- [CLARITY] The meaning of "X" is unclear and not resolved in the text, creating confusion.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the letter and the plot is not clearly explained, making the motivations of the characters less coherent.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift to Vardin finding the fuel capsule is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative setup.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Vardin and the Enterprise feels disconnected from the previous sections.  
- [LOGIC] The motivations of Garr Symm are introduced but not fully explained, making his actions less coherent.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the proto-man letter and the overall plot is not clearly established.
