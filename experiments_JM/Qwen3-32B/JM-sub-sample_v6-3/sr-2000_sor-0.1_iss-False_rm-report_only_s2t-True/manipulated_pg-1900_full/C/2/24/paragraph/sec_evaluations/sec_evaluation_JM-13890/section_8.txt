Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "This glass is all prior to 1220, and without it there would have been no representation of the first shrine at all." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "For any description of the tombs of the archbishops there is, unfortunately, no space here." (awkward word order)  
- [LEXICON] "This very short description of such a building must be regarded as a mere introduction to the study of a vast subject..." (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "In the splendid crypt, besides the interest of the various periods of Norman and Transitional work, there is the rich Perpendicular screenwork..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the windows to the tombs of the archbishops without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph jumps between architectural features (crypt, chapels, undercroft) without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] "where the martyr was laid until his translation in 1220 and where Henry II. had passed the night after his severe penance" (unclear reference to "where")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of the undercroft to the conclusion about the shortness of the description  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
