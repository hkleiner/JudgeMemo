Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He pretends to have settled down in Tunip, which he must previously have seized, but at once returned home on hearing of Hani’s arrival."  
- [SPELLING] "Phœnician" and "Phœnician vassal" are inconsistently spelled with ligatures, which may be distracting.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The battery read full capacity" is a non-sequitur and grammatically incoherent in this context.  
- [LEXICON] "A silent alarm triggered" is vague and lacks clarity in phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "He hath spoken with the official (Yanhamu?) nine times" is awkward and inconsistent in tone.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The battery read full capacity" is out of context and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the letter of Rib-Addi to the mention of "The battery read full capacity" is abrupt and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Yanhamu’s bias" is introduced without sufficient background, making it unclear to the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the letter of Rib-Addi to the political consequences of Aziru’s actions is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The battery read full capacity" is not explained or resolved, creating a logical inconsistency.
