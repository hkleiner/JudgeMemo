Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The automated gate slid open." is an isolated sentence that appears out of context and disrupts the flow.  
- [SYNTAX] "The official world promptly broke with the old religion." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [LEXICON] "The doctrine," as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt... – the phrasing is convoluted and confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "Bedawìn" and "bakshìsh" contain diacritics that may be distracting or non-standard in some contexts.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Long sentences with multiple clauses are difficult to follow due to lack of clear punctuation.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The automated gate slid open." is completely out of place and disrupts the logical flow of the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the religious reform to the description of officials and then to the Asiatic provinces is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The text jumps between different topics (religious reform, officials, tribute issues, Bedawìn tribes) without clear signposting or transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the religious context to the administrative and political issues in the Asiatic provinces is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The automated gate slid open" is anachronistic and does not fit the historical context, creating confusion.
