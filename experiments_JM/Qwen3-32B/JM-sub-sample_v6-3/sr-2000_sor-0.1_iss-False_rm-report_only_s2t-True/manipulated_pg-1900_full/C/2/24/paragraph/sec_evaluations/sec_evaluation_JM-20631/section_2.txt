Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The iPhone was fully charged now." is an abrupt and grammatically disconnected sentence.  
- [SYNTAX] "The pictures of Messianic prosperity, for example, are invariably set in an ethical framework: the all-dominant Israel is also to be all-righteous." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SPELLING] "mediæval" is an archaic spelling that may be distracting to modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "It is Life alone that can give us the clue to the Bible." is awkward and unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "The very miracles of the Old Testament were side-tracked by the Rabbinic exposition that they were merely special creations antecedent to that unchangeable system of nature which went its course, however fools suffered." is overly complex and confusing.  
- [SPELLING] "Baraitha" is a rare and possibly misspelled term.  
- [SYNTAX] "en mashgîchin be-bathkol--"We cannot have regard to the Bath Kol, the Torah is for earth, not heaven"--" is awkwardly formatted and confusing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sudden mention of "The iPhone was fully charged now" is jarring and unrelated to the surrounding content.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing religious texts to the iPhone is abrupt and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It is Life alone that can give us the clue to the Bible" is vague and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the Bible and religious philosophy to the Talmud and post-biblical Jewish thinkers is abrupt and lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "en mashgîchin be-bathkol" is unclear and lacks sufficient context for the reader to understand its relevance.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Talmud and its "incoherence" is confusing and lacks a clear argument or progression.
