Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The VR headset sat quietly on the table" appears out of context and disrupts the flow.  
- [SPELLING] "pecuniary difficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense originality, they pursued a steady course to the end of their lives." – Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation.  
- [SYNTAX] "The marvellous 'Breaking the Clod,' now happily permanently housed at the British Museum, betrays the same tremendous conception..." – Cumbersome and wordy.  
- [LEXICON] "The mind and character of the man can be read in every line and in every touch of the brush." – Ambiguous phrasing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences, e.g., "He started life with enormous disadvantages; without friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his cause; without money..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The VR headset sat quietly on the table" is an irrelevant and jarring insertion that breaks the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the biographical section to the analysis of Millet's art is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Millet's life to the "Man with the Hoe" and then to the VR headset is disjointed and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "socialistic doctrines" and their relation to Millet's art is not clearly explained, leading to ambiguity.  
- [CONTEXT] The text references "the 'Man with the Hoe'" without prior introduction, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the work.
