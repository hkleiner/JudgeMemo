Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the naked breasts of the Russian soldiers" is awkward and potentially offensive phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "the Germans had planned to have done with Russia by confronting it with Austrian armies and with four or five additional German corps" is convoluted and difficult to parse.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "If we take into consideration all the Russian theatres of war, including those in Asia, the enemy kept on the Russian fronts 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions,--altogether 192 divisions (in May, 1917) while on the Anglo-French front the enemy had in May, 1917, only 142 divisions."  
- [LEXICON] "the Russian positions were covered not by barbed wire entanglements, but by the naked breasts of the Russian soldiers" is an unusual and potentially inappropriate metaphor.  
- [SPELLING] "1915 they were swallowed up by the Russian front during the German offensive in Poland, and the Verdun operation was frustrated because, as Ludendorf declares, there were no reserves with which to develop the first success of the Germans." â€“ "swallowed up" is a colloquial and imprecise term in a historical context.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between historical facts and speculative "what if" scenarios without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is repetitive, reiterating the same points about the Russian front's role in diverting German forces.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between Russia's military struggles and the broader Allied strategy is not always clearly explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the 1915 situation to the 1916 and 1917 offensives is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text oscillates between factual statements and interpretations of Ludendorf's memoirs without clearly distinguishing between the two.
