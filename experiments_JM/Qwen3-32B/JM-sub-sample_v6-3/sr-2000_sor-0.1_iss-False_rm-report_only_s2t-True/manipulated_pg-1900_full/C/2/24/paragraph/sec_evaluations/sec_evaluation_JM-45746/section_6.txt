2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrative with "A notification popped onto the windshield" – this sentence is out of place and disrupts the flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the janitor story to the chapter on "How the Principal Can Help the Teacher" without a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on the questionnaire and teacher responses is well-structured, but the transition from the janitor story to this section is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "I am not sure but that the raise in salary pleased me more than it did him" is slightly confusing in phrasing.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the "ungraded room with an auxiliary teacher" is somewhat disconnected from the previous discussion about the janitor and the principal-teacher relationship.
