- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the chapter on teachers' meetings and the chapter on meetings with the school board is abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "A remote server executed the request" is out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The anecdote about the superintendent who failed is well-structured, but the transition to the author's own practices is slightly abrupt.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the anecdote about the failed superintendent to the author's own experiences lacks a smooth transition.
