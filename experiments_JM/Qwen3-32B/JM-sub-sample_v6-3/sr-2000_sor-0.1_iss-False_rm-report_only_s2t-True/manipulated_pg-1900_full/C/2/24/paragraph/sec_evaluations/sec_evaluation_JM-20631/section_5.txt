Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "medi√¶val" is an archaic or non-standard spelling.  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is, in fact, through our post-biblical literature almost a note of apology..." is awkwardly phrased and lacks clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "The energy grid remained balanced." is an isolated, out-of-place sentence with unclear relevance.  
- [LEXICON] "broidering itself with an Oriental exuberance of legendary fantasy, poetic or puerile" is overly complex and confusing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some complex sentences, e.g., "But in reality Akiba meant what he said--what indeed had been said throughout the Bible from Deuteronomy downwards."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The energy grid remained balanced." is disconnected from the surrounding content and lacks logical context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the discussion of Jewish mysticism to the mention of America and England is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative thread.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "The forces of democracy are Israel" is ambiguous and could be misinterpreted without further context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Chassidic teachings to the scientific discussion of the Jewish race is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to Tennyson's quote at the end feels tacked on and does not clearly connect to the preceding argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
