Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "A diagnostic tool scanned the network" appears out of context and is grammatically disconnected from surrounding text. - [GRAMMAR] "The motion sensor caught a brief movement" similarly appears out of context and is grammatically disconnected. - [SYNTAX] Some sentences have complex structures that make them slightly difficult to parse, particularly in the historical narrative sections. - [LEXICON] Some archaic or formal word choices may be slightly jarring in context.

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The text contains two out-of-place sentences ("A diagnostic tool scanned the network" and "The motion sensor caught a brief movement") that have no logical connection to the historical narrative. - [STRUCTURE] The transition between the historical narrative and these out-of-place sentences is abrupt and confusing. - [CLARITY] The overall structure is generally clear, but the inclusion of these unrelated sentences disrupts the flow and coherence of the historical account.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
