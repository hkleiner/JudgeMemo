Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The remains of the buildings of the Black, or Preaching, Friars, and those of the Grey Friars, who belonged to the rule of St. Francis, are on islands formed by the Stour" (awkward phrasing and excessive commas)  
- [SYNTAX] "it is never possible to see it" (redundant phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "one must be content with the picturesque brick gateway of the Roper house" (somewhat vague and imprecise language)  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The transition between the description of hospitals and churches is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the only one lacking in interest is All Saints' in High Street" is introduced without clear connection to the prior sentence.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Roper house in St. Dunstan's Street" is unclear without additional context.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
