Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Missing commas in dialogue tags. - [PUNCTUATION] Missing quotation marks for dialogue. - [SPELLING] "’Tis" and "’twas" used inconsistently. - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "One July morning, over a hundred years ago there stood in a forlorn room of a log house in Plymouth, a tall, severe looking woman in rich apparel, and a ragged desperate child of fourteen." - [LEXICON] "Deb can do without you" is slightly unclear phrasing. - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences like "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes." - [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrases like "Just then the man upon the floor stirred and roused; after many exertions he sat up."

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from narrative to "The motion sensor caught a brief movement" which seems out of place. - [LOGIC] The mention of a motion sensor is anachronistic and disrupts the historical context. - [CLARITY] The transition from Debby's childhood to the motion sensor is abrupt and confusing. - [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about Debby's mother is disconnected from the previous narrative about her father and the motion sensor.
