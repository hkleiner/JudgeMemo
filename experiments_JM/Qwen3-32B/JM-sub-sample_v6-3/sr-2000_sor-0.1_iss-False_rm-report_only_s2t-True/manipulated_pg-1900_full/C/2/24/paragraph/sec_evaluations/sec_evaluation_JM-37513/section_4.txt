Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Spencer tried to reduce all kinds of relatedness to one quasi-mechanical type; and he signally failed--or shall I say that he succeeded only by ignoring all the specific differences..."  
- [SPELLING] "smudgy" is an informal or non-standard word choice.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The AI assistant adjusted the lights." and "The wearable device tracked sleep patterns." are out of context and grammatically correct but disrupt the flow.  
- [LEXICON] "effective" is used in a non-standard or ambiguous way in "modes of relatedness which carry this kind of implication, effective."  
- [SYNTAX] "It is to remove this ambiguity that I have suggested that the word Source should be substituted for cause in this sense." is overly complex and hard to follow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from philosophical discussion to "The AI assistant adjusted the lights." and "The wearable device tracked sleep patterns." which are unrelated and disrupt the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and lacks clear transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "effective" in the context of "modes of relatedness which carry this kind of implication, effective" is unclear.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Spencer to introducing "The AI assistant adjusted the lights." is jarring and lacks any logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Source" and "force" in a way that is not consistently defined, leading to ambiguity.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
