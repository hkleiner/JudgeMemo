Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was of a contemplative disposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was of a contemplative disposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty." (redundant structure)  
- [SPELLING] "tranquillity of the m√©nage more than counterbalanced..." (uncommon word usage may confuse some readers)  
- [LEXICON] "He was devouredly attached to this old man..." (incorrect word: "devouredly" instead of "devotedly")  
- [SYNTAX] "The good man seems to have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all natural phenomenon which was passing around him..." (awkward phrasing and incorrect use of "phenomenon" as singular)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was so missed in his own home, that when he came back for his first holidays it was decided that he should not return." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "A touchscreen blinked to life." (sudden, unrelated phrase at the end of the section)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A touchscreen blinked to life." (sudden, unrelated phrase at the end of the section disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The section transitions abruptly from a detailed description of Millet's early life to a modern, unrelated phrase at the end.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative is generally clear, but the final sentence ("A touchscreen blinked to life.") is jarring and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the next chapter ("CHAPTER: THE MIGRATION TO PARIS") is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection to the previous content.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
