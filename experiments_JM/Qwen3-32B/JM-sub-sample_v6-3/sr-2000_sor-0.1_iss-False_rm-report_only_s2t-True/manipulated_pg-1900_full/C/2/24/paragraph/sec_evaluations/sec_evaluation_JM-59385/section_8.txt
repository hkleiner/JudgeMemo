Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The affairs of government rocked above her head." - [SPELLING] "midforenoon" is an uncommon and awkward term. - [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the line "Wherein the narrator becomes Kuei Pingâ€™s pupil and is filled with wondering questions and is witness to a dream come true in its threefold parts." - [LEXICON] "fatty places" is an unclear and awkward phrase. - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The piteous flock did not know what else to do."
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's story to the narrator becoming her pupil feels abrupt and disconnected. - [STRUCTURE] The final section about the narrator feels like a different narrative voice and style, disrupting the flow of the main story. - [CLARITY] The transition from Kuei Ping's life story to the narrator's experience is unclear and jarring. - [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the narrator appears out of context with no clear connection to the rest of the text.
