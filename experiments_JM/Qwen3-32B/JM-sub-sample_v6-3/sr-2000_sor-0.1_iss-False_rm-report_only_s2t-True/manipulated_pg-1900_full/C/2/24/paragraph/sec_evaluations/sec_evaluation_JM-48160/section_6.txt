Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "taubes" should be "taubes" (correct as is, but inconsistent capitalization)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Their only excitement they owe to the frequent visits of the taubes" (awkward phrasing, should be "owed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I forgot to ask. Probably not." (fragmented sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The teleport pad dimmed after use." (sudden, unrelated sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The hologram flickered to life." (sudden, unrelated sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I, alas! missed this thrilling sight" (inconsistent punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "amounting to many millions of francs (Arras by moonlight is said to be the most beautiful sight on earth)" (awkward parenthetical insertion)  
- [GRAMMAR] "This is the type that always asks; 'Now, did you ever meet anybody who really has seen these things, or did somebody hear it from somebody else?' &c." (inconsistent punctuation and formatting)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unrelated sentences like "A touchscreen panel showed static." and "The teleport pad dimmed after use." disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] "The hologram flickered to life." is similarly out of place and unrelated to the surrounding context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from describing the war zone to unrelated commentary on American attitudes and then back to the war zone, creating a disjointed structure.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the war zone to the anecdote about the Crown Prince of Germany and the Bulgarian princes is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The parenthetical statement about Arras by moonlight is inserted awkwardly and disrupts the flow of the argument.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Miss Polk and Miss Ethel Crocker is somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative and lacks a smooth transition.
