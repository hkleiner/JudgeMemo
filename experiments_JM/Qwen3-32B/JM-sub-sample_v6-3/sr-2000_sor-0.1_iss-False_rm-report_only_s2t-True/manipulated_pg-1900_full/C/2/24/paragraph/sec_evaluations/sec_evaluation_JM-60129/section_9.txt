2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentences "The backup server initialized smoothly" and "A mobile hotspot activated" are completely out of context and disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from describing the YÃ¶gurs' daily life and customs to unrelated technical sentences, breaking the logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense, with some sections feeling repetitive or unfocused, such as the detailed description of the wolf trap.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially when moving from descriptions of daily life to religious practices and then to hunting and superstitions.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are unclear or ambiguous, such as "the same word over and over again" without specifying what word is being repeated.
