Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "part of Sheridanâ€™s forces which **has** pushed northwest..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "Rowanty Creek" (likely a typo; should be "Rowanty" or another correct spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "The problem of assigning a proper significance to Five Forks is a difficult one." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the invading army" (vague reference without clear antecedent)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the tactical details of the Battle of Five Forks to a broader historical reflection on the significance of the battle, with minimal transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about the Fall of Petersburg and Richmond begins abruptly without a clear connection to the preceding section on Five Forks  
- [CLARITY] "the invading army" is unclear and lacks context  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the tactical to the strategic is abrupt and lacks smooth narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
