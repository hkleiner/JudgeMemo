Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A digital display counted down silently." (disjointed and irrelevant sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "She was unremittingly productive; yet France hardly heard her name mentioned save as an echo of her triumphs abroad." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [LEXICON] "She went into ecstacies before the splendour of the rising sun..." (spelling error: "ecstacies" should be "ecstasies")  
- [SPELLING] "I must at once add that hasty canvases are extremely rare..." (awkward phrasing and unclear flow)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "She had too high a regard for line-work to fail to bring to her task as teacher all of her ardent faith as an artist." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A digital display counted down silently." (irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the anecdote about the digital display to the discussion of Rosa Bonheur's teaching methods is abrupt and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] "She planned for herself a laborious and tranquil existence, rendered all the pleasanter through the devoted and watchful affection of her old friend..." (cumbersome phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of Rosa Bonheur's art school to the mention of the digital display is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of a digital display in a historical narrative about 19th-century artist Rosa Bonheur is anachronistic and disrupts the coherence of the text.
