Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The discouragement of the homesick, who never knew when, or if, they would return to their homes, was a hardship not peculiar to any rank."  
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" is correctly spelled but may be considered overly formal or out of tone with the rest of the text.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some complex sentences, such as "The battery read full capacity."  
- [LEXICON] Use of "grim business" is acceptable but could be considered slightly informal in a historical narrative.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between narrative and bullet points without clear transitions, which may confuse the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The section begins with a list of events (e.g., "MARCH 25, 1865. Fort Stedman...") but then shifts to a broader narrative without clear linkage.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "FORT GREGG, FORT MAHONE..." is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the list of forts to the broader narrative about the Petersburg campaign is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
