Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was still too dazed from the blow on his head to offer any resistance when her strong hands tugged at his belt and withdrew the m.g. gun." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "m.g. gun" (inconsistent formatting; should be "M.G. gun" or "MG gun")  
- [SYNTAX] "He tried to stand up and make his way back to the controls again, but collapsed and went down to his knees." (redundant phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "He crouched there, trying to shake the fog from his brain." (vague and imprecise language)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He said: 'All right, Margot. All right.'" (unnecessary repetition and missing punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "Temperature: minus two hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit." (awkward phrasing; "minus" is less common in formal writing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But if I went out there I'd perish from cold in seconds and lack of air in minutes." (awkward structure and missing article)  
- [SPELLING] "Ben Adam, he thought. Abou Ben Adam, Humpty Dumpty, hurry, hurry, hurry, the only two headed get yours here the sum of the square of the sides is equal to the square of the hyper-space, no, mustn't think that mimsy were the borogroves and the momraths now what the heck did the momraths do anyhow absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular activity...." (incoherent and fragmented thoughts)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Ramsey's physical struggle to his internal thoughts is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between action, dialogue, and internal monologue without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of hyper-space and its relationship to time and temperature is introduced but not clearly explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Ramsey's physical state to the philosophical discussion of fear and power is jarring and lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The idea that a weapon cannot function in hyper-space due to the absence of time is introduced but not clearly connected to the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The internal monologue of Ramsey is disjointed and lacks a clear focus, making it difficult to follow.  
- [LOGIC] The resolution of the conflict between Ramsey and Margot is abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup or explanation.
