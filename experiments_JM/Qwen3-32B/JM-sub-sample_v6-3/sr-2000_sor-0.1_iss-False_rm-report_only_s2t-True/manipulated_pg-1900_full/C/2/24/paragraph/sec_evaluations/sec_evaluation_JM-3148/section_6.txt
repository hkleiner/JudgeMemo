- [SPELLING] "narrer part" (misspelling of "narrower")  
- [SYNTAX] "I should stand it till ’bout Friday—seein’ ’em lay on the grass there—but if she didn’t take ’em in then..." (awkward and informal syntax)  
- [LEXICON] "She may be bleachin’ of ’em out, but it looks slack" (non-standard phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I can even believe she was glad to have died, since her dying could bring such content to any wretched living human soul." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Lyddy’s domestic habits to her emotional transformation is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts from Lyddy’s daily routine to her emotional response to music without sufficient setup or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Anthony Croft’s appearance and the violin’s effect on Lyddy is vague and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Lyddy’s internal monologue to the poetic description of the violin is jarring and lacks smooth transition.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The tone shifts from casual and conversational to poetic and elevated without clear justification.
