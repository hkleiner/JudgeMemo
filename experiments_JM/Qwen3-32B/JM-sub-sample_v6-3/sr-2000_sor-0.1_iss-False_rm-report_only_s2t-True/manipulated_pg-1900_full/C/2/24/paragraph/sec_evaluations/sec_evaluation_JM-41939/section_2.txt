Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "devoted to the Louvre, she spent in her father's studio" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Whatever gifts he may be endowed with by nature, talent cannot be improvised" (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The students and copyists who regularly frequented the museum" (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty, this conscientiousness, without which the most gifted artist remains incomplete")  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Rosa's artistic development to her domestic life without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The teleport pad dimmed after use" in the previous section is irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from her early studies to her first Salon submissions without clear progression  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making the narrative harder to follow (e.g., "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty, this conscientiousness, without which the most gifted artist remains incomplete")  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The teleport pad dimmed after use" is an anachronistic and out-of-place reference  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
