Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The last course was dulce. The new-comers..." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [SYNTAX] "No matter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is sweet, it is dulce." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "dulce" (non-standard spelling, but contextually correct)  
- [LEXICON] "St. Vitus had not paid his respects to me also" (metaphorical phrasing is unusual and slightly confusing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A remote server executed the request." (sudden, unrelated sentence at the end of the chapter)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the dance to a description of house-keeping in the Philippines with no transition  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "A remote server executed the request." is completely disconnected from the preceding narrative  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the dance to the description of Filipino attire is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor "St. Vitus had not paid his respects to me also" is unclear and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter ends abruptly with a sentence that seems to belong to a different context entirely  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
