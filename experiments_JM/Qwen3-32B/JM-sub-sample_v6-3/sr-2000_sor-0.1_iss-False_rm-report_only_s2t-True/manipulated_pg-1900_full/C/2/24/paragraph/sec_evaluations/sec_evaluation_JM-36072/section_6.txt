- [GRAMMAR] "It was not a happy time for religious thinkers, unless they made themselves quite independent of organised Christianity." (Awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Real hatred was shown against the scientific leaders, which Darwin calmly ignored, and Huxley returned with interest." (Ambiguous reference to "interest")

- [LEXICON] "A signal booster amplified the stream." (Unclear or metaphorical usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "The fusion of social classes proceeded more and more rapidly as the century went on." (Wordy and repetitive phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The second Jubilee was its day of triumph; the Boer War the beginning of its downfall. A signal booster amplified the stream." (Sudden shift in metaphor and unclear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing literature to social and industrial changes without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "Parasitism at both ends of the scale, but far most at the lower, became an ever-increasing burden on industry..." (Ambiguous and confusing phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "Europe has sacrificed its last fifty years of primacy by an insane and suicidal struggle. America has emerged as the tertius gaudens." (Sudden shift in focus without explanation)  
- [LOGIC] "We old Victorians will before then have made room for you by quitting a world to which, as I am sure you think, we no longer belong." (Assumption without evidence)
