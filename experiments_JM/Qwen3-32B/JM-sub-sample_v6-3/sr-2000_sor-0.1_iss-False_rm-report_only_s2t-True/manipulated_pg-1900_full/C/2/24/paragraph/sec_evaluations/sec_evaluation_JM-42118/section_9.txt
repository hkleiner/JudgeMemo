Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He returned to Paris a poor old man."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "He won a passing success with an historic canvas or so..."  
- [SPELLING] "He is to be seen wandering about the Louvre dressed in a cloak or overcoat of a mixed grey cloth, without hooks or eyes or buttons..." (redundant phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "He painted rarely now" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma in "he has red cheeks, sparkling eyes, grey hair very much frizzed out; he is to be seen..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's personal life to historical context about the Revolution and French art without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from Fragonard's death to a broader historical and artistic analysis, which feels abrupt and disconnected.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is dense and difficult to follow, with multiple ideas introduced without clear organization.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Fragonard's death to the broader discussion of French art lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces new concepts (e.g., the role of Watteau, Boucher, and Chardin) without sufficient context or explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
