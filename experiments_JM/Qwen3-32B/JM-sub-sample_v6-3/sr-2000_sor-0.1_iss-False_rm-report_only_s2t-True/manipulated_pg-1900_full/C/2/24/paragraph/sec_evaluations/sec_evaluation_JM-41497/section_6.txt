Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had not studied Bellini and Correggio for nothing" is awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "We have but to turn to the work of his great contemporaries, Gainsborough and Romney, to see the difference between women in whose veins the blood runs red, and women who feed on nectar and ambrosia and were never seen at a disadvantage in their lives." is overly complex and slightly confusing.  
- [LEXICON] "the blood runs red" is a metaphor that may be unclear to some readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "It seems to the writer that women and children were to Reynolds fit and proper subjects for the exercise of his gifts, but at the same time, folk in whom he had no abiding interest." is awkward and could be clearer.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had dealt with a subject, it was well-nigh impossible to approach it again, save in the way of imitation." lacks a conjunction or transition.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "To satisfy the claims of Reynolds' brush it was absolutely necessary that his sitters should have character, even if it was a bad one." lacks a comma after "brush."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Reynolds' portrayal of women and children to his portraits of men is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Admiral Keppel painting is somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion of Reynolds' style.  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor "feed on nectar and ambrosia" is vague and could be confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Reynolds' portraits of men to the issue of color and restoration is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the fading of Reynolds' colors and the need to view his work from a literary standpoint is somewhat disjointed from the earlier discussion of his artistic style.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
