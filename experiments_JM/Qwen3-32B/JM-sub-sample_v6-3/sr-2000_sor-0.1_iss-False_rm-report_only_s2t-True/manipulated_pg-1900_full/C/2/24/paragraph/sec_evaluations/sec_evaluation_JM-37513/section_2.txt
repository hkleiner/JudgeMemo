Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "the discussion of which, in the Nonconformist of 1842, constituted the first step from the life of an engineer to that other kind of life..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Overuse of passive voice and nominalizations, e.g., "It will be urged that Spencer widened to men's view the scope of scientific explanation."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous or overly abstract word usage, e.g., "force" used in multiple senses without clear distinction.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse or overuse of commas in long sentences, e.g., "He proclaimed 'the gradual growth of all things by natural processes out of natural antecedents'."  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with multiple clauses, e.g., "It is true that the affairs of the mind give pause and seem to present something of a difficulty. But even here 'specifically stated, the problem is to interpret mental evolution in terms of the redistribution of matter and motion'."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in focus from Spencer's philosophy to abstract metaphysical concepts without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear paragraphing to separate distinct ideas, e.g., moving from Spencer's contributions to the discussion of the Unknowable without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] Overly abstract and dense language that obscures the main argument, e.g., "the persistence of some Cause which transcends our knowledge and conception."  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between ideas, e.g., from Spencer's philosophy to the role of science in addressing ultimate questions.  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of ideas without progression, e.g., repeated emphasis on the "Unknowable" without resolution or synthesis.
