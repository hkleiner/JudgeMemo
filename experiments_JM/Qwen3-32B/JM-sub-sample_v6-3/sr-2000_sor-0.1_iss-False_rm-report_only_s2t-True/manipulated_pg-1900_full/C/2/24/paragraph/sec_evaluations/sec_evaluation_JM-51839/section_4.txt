Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "Charles S." in the sentence "Charles S. Taylor was very prominent in public affairs."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "James Reily" in the sentence "James Reily, who was minister to the United States, had his home here."  
- [SPELLING] "premised" is likely a typo; the intended word is "predisposed" or "agreed" in the sentence "they readily premised peace and disavowed any connection with the Mexican insurgents."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It was the home of many of the prominent leaders of Texas during the time of the republic, whose influence was felt in the public affairs of the country."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the Cordova Rebellion to commercial expansion without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about prominent citizens feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about the rebellion.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "The e-ink wallpaper changed patterns" is out of context and disrupts the historical narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between the end of the "Republic" chapter and the beginning of the "Cordova Rebellion" chapter.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
