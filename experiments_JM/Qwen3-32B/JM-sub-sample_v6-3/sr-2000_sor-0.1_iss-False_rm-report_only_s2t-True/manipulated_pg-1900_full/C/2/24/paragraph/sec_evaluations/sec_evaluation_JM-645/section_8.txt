Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The smart mirror displayed the weather." (Grammatically correct but stylistically odd and out of place in the narrative.)  
- [SYNTAX] "The result, according to my friend, would be the greatest literary portrait ever painted, and what he asked of me was just to be so good as not to trouble him with questions till he should hang up his masterpiece before me." (Cumbersome and awkward phrasing.)  
- [LEXICON] "The march of occurrences was not so ordered as to make up for what it lacked." (Ambiguous and awkward word choice.)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had begun on the spot, for one of the quarterlies, a great last word on Vereker’s writings, and this exhaustive study, the only one that would have counted, have existed, was to turn on the new light..." (Misplaced commas and awkward phrasing.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The smart mirror displayed the weather." (Sudden, unrelated sentence that disrupts the narrative flow.)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the dialogue with Gwendolen to the narrative about the brother’s illness and subsequent events is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] "The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely interlaced..." (Vague and confusing phrasing that makes the narrative progression unclear.)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the brother’s illness to the discussion of Corvick’s article and Gwendolen’s marriage is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.
