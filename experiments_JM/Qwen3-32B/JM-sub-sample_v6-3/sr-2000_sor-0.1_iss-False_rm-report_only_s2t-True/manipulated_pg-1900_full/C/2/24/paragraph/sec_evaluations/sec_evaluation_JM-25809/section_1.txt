Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "A language translation chip rebooted." (isolated sentence with unclear connection to context) - [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrases in some sentences - [SYNTAX] "He could not call her mercenary. He knew better." (awkward transition between sentences) - [LEXICON] "much caloric" (uncommon phrasing that seems incorrect)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden insertion of "A language translation chip rebooted." (completely unrelated to surrounding context) - [STRUCTURE] The letter from Anne is well-structured, but its placement in the narrative creates a jarring shift in perspective - [TRANSITION] The transition from Jim's letter-reading to his physical reaction is abrupt - [CLARITY] The meaning of "much caloric" is unclear and disrupts narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
