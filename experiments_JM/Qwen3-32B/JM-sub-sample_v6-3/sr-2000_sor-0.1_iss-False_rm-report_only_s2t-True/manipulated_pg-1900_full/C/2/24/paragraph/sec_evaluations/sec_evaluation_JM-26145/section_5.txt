Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." (irrelevant and out of context, likely a typo or error)  
- [SPELLING] "Sutu" (possibly a typo or misused term, unclear if intentional)  
- [SYNTAX] "The characters of the two irreconcilable monarchs, who show each other up so admirably for our edification, make any question as to which had right on his side seem comparatively trifling." (awkward phrasing and complex structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The old king, who had called Ishtar of Nineveh to his help..." (unclear reference, possibly a misused or misplaced term)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The auto-tuner adjusted the sound levels." (completely out of context and disrupts the narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from a detailed diplomatic letter to a sentence about an auto-tuner, then back to the narrative without explanation  
- [CLARITY] "Sutu of the desert—doubtless at the instigation of the Babylonians—were about to kill every Egyptian..." (unclear reference to "Sutu," lacks clarity)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the letter from Tushratta to the mention of "IV. LETTERS FROM ASIATIC VASSALS." without a smooth connection  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
