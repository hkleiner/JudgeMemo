Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein shadows throw their length across the tidy courtyard" and "Wherein there is deepening sorrow" (fragmented and poetic style may be intentional but disrupts standard fluency).
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the fragmented lines "Wherein shadows throw their length across the tidy courtyard" and "Wherein there is deepening sorrow."
- [LEXICON] Use of "motion sensor" and "auto-cleaning system" feels out of place in the historical narrative context.
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in the fragmented poetic lines.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of modern elements like "motion sensor" and "auto-cleaning system" disrupts the historical narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] The fragmented poetic lines ("Wherein shadows...") interrupt the narrative flow and create abrupt transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between detailed family life and sudden, unexplained modern elements, creating confusion about the timeline and setting.
- [CLARITY] The mention of "speech recognition unit" and "auto-cleaning system" lacks context and explanation, making their relevance unclear.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
