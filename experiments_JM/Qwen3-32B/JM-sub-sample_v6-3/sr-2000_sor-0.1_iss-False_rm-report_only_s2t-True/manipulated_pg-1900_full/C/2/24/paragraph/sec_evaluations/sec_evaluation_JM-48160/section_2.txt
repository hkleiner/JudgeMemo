Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I believe it was early in 1914 that some German General said..." (missing article "a")  
- [GRAMMAR] "What the matter was with Frenchmen in ‘70 is beside the question." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "mitrailleuses" (correct spelling, but may be unfamiliar to some readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "I sniffed and grumbled, but received nothing further but sympathy." (repetition of "nothing further but")  
- [LEXICON] "A machine-learning model updated itself." (jarring anachronism, out of context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "A machine-learning model updated itself." (disrupts narrative flow and historical context)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the interaction with the Bureau de Place official to the anachronistic line about a machine-learning model (confusing and unexplained)  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "‘70" is unclear without context (likely refers to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, but not explicitly stated)  
- [STRUCTURE] The final line ("A machine-learning model updated itself.") is disconnected from the rest of the narrative and lacks explanation  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
