- [GRAMMAR] "I’d have spent half the night with him" (missing "have" for correct past perfect tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I’d have repeated my recent act of faith—I’d have spent half the night with him" (awkward em dash usage and parallel structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I _had_ no knowledge—nobody had any" (awkward formatting and em dash usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I _had_ no knowledge—nobody had any" (repetition of "had" is redundant and awkward)

- [GRAMMAR] "I was accidentally so much more explicit with you than it had ever entered into my game to be" (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "doa stuff tell anybody why" (likely typo: "doa" should be "do a" or "don’t")
