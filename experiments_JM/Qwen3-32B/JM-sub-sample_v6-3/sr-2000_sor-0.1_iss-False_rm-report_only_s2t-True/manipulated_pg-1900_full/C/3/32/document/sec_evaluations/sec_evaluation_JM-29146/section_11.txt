Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Moments later--although the elapsed time was subjective--they blasted off." (Dashes used incorrectly; em dashes should be used consistently or replaced with commas.)  
- [SYNTAX] "They had, Ramsey knew, all of space and the life-span of mortal man to enjoy together." (Awkward placement of "Ramsey knew" disrupts flow.)  
- [LEXICON] "She smiled at Ramsey tremulously." (Uncommon phrasing; "tremulously" is awkward in this context.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "I am nothing. I am the end-product of an equation..." (Sudden shift in tone and perspective from dialogue to monologue without clear transition.)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The gleaming walls were gone. The black box was gone. Vardin was gone." (Repetitive structure; could be condensed for better flow.)  
- [CLARITY] "They had, Ramsey knew, all of space and the life-span of mortal man to enjoy together." (Ambiguous phrasing; unclear whether "they" refers to Ramsey and Margot or a broader group.)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
