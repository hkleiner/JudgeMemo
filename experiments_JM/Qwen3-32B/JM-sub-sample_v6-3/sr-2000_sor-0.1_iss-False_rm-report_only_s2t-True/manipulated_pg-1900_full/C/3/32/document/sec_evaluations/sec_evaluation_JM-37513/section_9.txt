Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "This much seems certain, for those who accept the spirit, though not perhaps the letter, of Spencer's teaching."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and technical terms without clear definition, e.g., "constitutive mode of relatedness," "heredity-relatedness."  
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous or unclear subject-verb agreement in some sentences.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of commas and semicolons, leading to run-on sentences.  
- [CLARITY] Repetition of phrases such as "physico-chemical" and "relatedness" without variation, reducing readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments shift abruptly between topics, e.g., from physiological processes to gravitational knowledge.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples (e.g., billiard-ball motion) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "knowledge in the extended sense" and "cognitive knowledge" is not consistently maintained, leading to confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear signposting between paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The author introduces multiple concepts (e.g., vitalism, heredity-relatedness) without clearly linking them to the central thesis.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
