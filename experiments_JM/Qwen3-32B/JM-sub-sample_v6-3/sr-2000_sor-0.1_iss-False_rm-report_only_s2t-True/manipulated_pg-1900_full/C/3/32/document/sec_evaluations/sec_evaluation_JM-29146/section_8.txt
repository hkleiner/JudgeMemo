Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing" used in place of a specific noun, causing confusion  
- [SYNTAX] "on a thing, a day of time passes when Earth moves through space on an arc one three-hundred-sixty-fifth of its orbit around the sun in length" is awkward and confusingly structured  
- [LEXICON] "a stuff" is unclear and likely a typo or placeholder  
- [SPELLING] "thing" is used inappropriately in multiple places, likely a placeholder or error  
- [SYNTAX] "Since there isn't any time to measure extension with in hyper-space, since time doesn't exist here, you can't speak of mid-points" is redundant and awkwardly phrased  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Ramsey's explanation of hyper-space to the Enterprise landing is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between multiple characters and perspectives without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "proto-man" and its connection to hyper-space is introduced but not clearly explained or resolved  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Ramsey's internal thoughts to the external action of Margot taking the gun is jarring and lacks smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "Garr Symm" and "Ramar Chind" without prior introduction disrupts the flow of the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
