- [LEXICON] "The thing" (repeated use of vague pronoun without clear antecedent)  
- [SYNTAX] "The curate, turning to Eileen, delivered himself of a statement of three words." (awkward and overly formal phrasing)

- [LOGIC] The hare's behavior and Excalibur's reaction are not clearly explained or connected to the main narrative  
- [CLARITY] The dialogue between Eileen and the curate is emotionally complex but lacks clear motivation or context  
- [LOGIC] The shift from Eileen and the curate's romantic conversation to the curate's decision to leave is abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup
