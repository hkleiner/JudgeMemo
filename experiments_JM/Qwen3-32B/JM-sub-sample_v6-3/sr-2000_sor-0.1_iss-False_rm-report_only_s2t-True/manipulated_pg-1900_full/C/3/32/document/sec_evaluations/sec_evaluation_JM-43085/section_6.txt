- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different aspects of Meissonier's life and work without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The text references "the battle of a stuff" and "the defence of the stuff" without providing context or explanation  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Meissonier's artistic process to his military service and back to his artistic philosophy  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the year of terror" without defining what this refers to  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the investment of Paris" without providing context for readers unfamiliar with the historical event
