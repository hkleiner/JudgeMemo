1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "By" appears multiple times where a proper name or location is expected.  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff himself" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the stuff Beneath the royal mane" is a grammatical error.  
- [SPELLING] "panthers" is a misspelling of "panthers" (though "panther" is correct, the plural is "panthers").  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter, with her astounding memory and with an eye as profound and luminous as a photographic lens, caught and retained the most fugitive expressions on the mobile physiognomy of the great cats." – overly complex and awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff" appears multiple times where a proper noun is expected.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing" appears multiple times where a proper noun is expected.  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff" and "the thing" are repeated inappropriately, likely due to OCR or transcription errors.  
- [GRAMMAR] "In all the animals that she painted,--and she painted nearly all the animals there are,--Rosa Bonheur succeeded..." – inconsistent punctuation and awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The duel in question is between two stallions, and what adds to the interest of the scene is that it is historic and perfectly familiar to all the sporting men of the stuff." – awkward and unclear phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "the stuff" and "the thing" disrupts the logical flow and makes it difficult to follow the intended meaning.  
- [CLARITY] The text references "the stuff" and "the thing" multiple times without clarification, leading to confusion.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the description of Rosa Bonheur's paintings to her personal life and later achievements is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The Duel" and "The Threshing of the Grain" is introduced without sufficient context or explanation of their significance.  
- [CLARITY] The text references "the stuff" in the context of awards and decorations, which is unclear and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between Rosa Bonheur's artistic achievements, personal relationships, and later life without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the stuff Beneath the royal mane" is confusing and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text mentions "the Cross of San Carlos of the stuff" and "the Cross of Saint James of the thing" without identifying the actual names of the orders, making the information unclear.
