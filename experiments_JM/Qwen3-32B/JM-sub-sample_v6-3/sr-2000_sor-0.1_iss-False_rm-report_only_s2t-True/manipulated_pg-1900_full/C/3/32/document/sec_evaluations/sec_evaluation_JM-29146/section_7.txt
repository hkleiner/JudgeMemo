Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "To put me in a position in which I could better do my--" (incomplete sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (repeated multiple times, likely a placeholder or error)  
- [SYNTAX] "As you know, a stuff, when it was decided to planetarize the stuff as a first step..." (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [LEXICON] "a stuff" (repeated use of "a stuff" without clear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "But at the top--who would crave isolation at the top?" (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "For example, Irwadi's form of government might have to be changed. At present, an autocratic bureaucracy with no one man at the top." (fragmented sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "a thing primary" (unclear or incorrect word usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "Several hundred yards across the Graveyard, watching, waiting, the occupants of Dog Star were armed to the teeth." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (not part of the text to evaluate, but included in the prompt)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff" (repeated use of "a stuff" without clear meaning disrupts logical flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from one scene to another without clear transitions (e.g., from Symm's thoughts to Vardin's actions)  
- [CLARITY] "a stuff" (repeated use of "a stuff" without clear meaning makes the text confusing)  
- [LOGIC] "a thing primary" (unclear or incorrect word usage disrupts logical flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different characters and locations without clear transitions (e.g., from Symm to Vardin to Ramsey)  
- [CLARITY] "a thing" (repeated use of "a thing" without clear meaning)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
