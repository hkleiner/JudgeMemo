2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and content at the end with the fragmented lines "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in a thing"  
- [STRUCTURE] The ending is abrupt and disjointed, breaking the narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] The final lines are unclear and lack context, making it difficult to understand their purpose or meaning  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed wedding narrative to the fragmented ending is jarring and lacks smooth connection  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Kuei Ping sneaking out of the compound is well-written but feels slightly disconnected from the preceding wedding narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
