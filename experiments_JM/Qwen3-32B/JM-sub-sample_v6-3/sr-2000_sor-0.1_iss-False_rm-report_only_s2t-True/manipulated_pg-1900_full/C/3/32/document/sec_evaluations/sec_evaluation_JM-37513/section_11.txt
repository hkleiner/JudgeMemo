Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "No such double-aspect theory as he accepted affords a satisfactory avenue of scientific approach." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But where Spencer failed, who has come within measurable sight of success?" (awkward inversion)  
- [LEXICON] "We are only just beginning to see our way to stating the problem..." (somewhat verbose and unclear phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "Surveying his work as a whole, we may confidently assert..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from critique of Spencer's philosophy to a general statement about his influence and legacy.  
- [STRUCTURE] The quote at the end is introduced abruptly and is not clearly tied to the preceding argument.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between the critique of Spencer's work and the broader historical assessment.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "treatment of this type of relatedness on lines similar to our treatment of other types of relatedness within one order of nature" is abstract and lacks clarity.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
