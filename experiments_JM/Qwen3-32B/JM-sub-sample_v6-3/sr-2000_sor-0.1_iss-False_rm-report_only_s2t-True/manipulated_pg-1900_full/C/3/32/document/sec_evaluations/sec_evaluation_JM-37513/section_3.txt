Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing without beginning or end" (missing article)  
- [SPELLING] "wellnigh" (archaic or obscure word, may be distracting)  
- [SYNTAX] "But Spencer uses a thing, a thing, in this connexion." (awkward repetition and phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "force" used in multiple ambiguous senses without clarification (confusing for reader)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "We only know that it exists, and somehow produces the whole show.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Spencer's philosophy to the author's critique of terminology without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Overly dense and repetitive argumentation (e.g., repeated emphasis on "force" and "Source")  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "force" and "Source" without consistent definition  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from philosophical discussion to the author's suggestion for terminology reform  
- [LOGIC] Lack of clear progression in the argument about Spencer's use of "force" and its implications  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
