2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "the thing" and "stuff" instead of proper nouns creates confusion and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The placeholder terms "the thing" and "stuff" are used in place of specific locations or names, making the text confusing and hard to follow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally jumps between descriptions and dialogue without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The character's decision to follow the man without a clear plan is not well-motivated or explained.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the tram ride to the pursuit of the man is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "hydrophobia, and lethal chambers, and distemper" is introduced without context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "a bullock's heart" is jarring and not clearly connected to the narrative.
