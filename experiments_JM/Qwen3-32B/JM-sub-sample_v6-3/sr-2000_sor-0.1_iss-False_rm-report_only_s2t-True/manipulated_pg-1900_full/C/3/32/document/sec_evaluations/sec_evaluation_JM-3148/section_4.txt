Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was no smoke coming out of the Butterfield chimney, and that the hens were gathered about the kitchen door clamouring for their breakfast" (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [SPELLING] "clamouring" (British spelling; may be inconsistent with expected dialect)  
- [SYNTAX] "The fortunate Vice-President suddenly called upon by destiny to guide the ship of state, the soldier who sees a possible thing in a hazardous engagement..." (run-on sentence with unclear structure)  
- [LEXICON] "There was no woman neighbour within a mile" (awkward phrasing; "woman neighbour" is not idiomatic)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The members of her own family stubbornly refused to die, however, even the distant connections living on and on to a ridiculous old age" (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The niece would be sent for when they found out where she lived; meanwhile the funeral could not be put off" (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Butterfield coffin-plates were a thing to be proud of" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She knew she couldn’t for the life of her think of anything interesting to say about Mrs. Butterfield, save that she possessed nineteen coffin-plates, and brought her hens to a thing every summer for their health" (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Don’t mention the thing—there’s be’n two in the fam’ly; nor insanity—there’s be’n one o’ them" (awkward phrasing and non-standard dialect)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Anthony Croft's story to the death of Mrs. Butterfield is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts from a philosophical reflection on Anthony to a detailed description of Mrs. Butterfield's death and funeral preparations without a clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "a thing" is unclear and may confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the funeral planning to Aunt Hitty's past experiences is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from Aunt Hitty's funeral planning to a description of a hymn without a clear connection.
