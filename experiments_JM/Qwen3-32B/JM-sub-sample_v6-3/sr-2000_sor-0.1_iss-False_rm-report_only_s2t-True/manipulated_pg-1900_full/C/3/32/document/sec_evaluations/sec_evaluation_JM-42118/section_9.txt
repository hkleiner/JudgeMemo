1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he is to be seen wandering about the Louvre dressed in a cloak or overcoat of a mixed grey cloth, without hooks or eyes or buttons--a cloak which the old man, when he is at work, ties at the waist with it does not matter what--a piece of string, a crumpled chiffon." (awkward phrasing and missing relative pronoun)  
- [SYNTAX] "The move was for a stuff but the prelude to a longer journey." (confusing syntax and unclear meaning)  
- [LEXICON] "Returning from the thing on a sultry day in August he becomes heated--enters a caf√© to eat an ice..." ("the thing" is vague and unclear)

- [GRAMMAR] "A stuff rid of the pomposity..." (incorrect use of "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The stuff that Louis the Fourteenth built..." (incorrect use of "the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "that Louis the Fifteenth still further corrupted by the worship of mere elegance; that Louis the Sixteenth sent to its grave--a suffering people out of which a real stuff arose..." (awkward phrasing and misuse of "stuff")
