Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "you must then admit that there is the same positive principle everywhere" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "you would change everything. You would in fact achieve perfection." (repetition and redundancy)  
- [LEXICON] "You can see instantly how amusing it would be." (ambiguous tone, unclear intent)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He reaches his ambition, and retires from the fight in order to enjoy life,--and what does he then do?" (misuse of em dash)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The proportion of men who, having established an equilibrium, proceed to die on the spot, is enormous." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Continual effort, which means, of course, continual disappointment, is the sine qua non--without it there is literally nothing vital." (awkward structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The hemlock would save them a lot of weary waiting." (vague reference to "hemlock")  
- [SYNTAX] "Real happiness is not an affair of the future; it is an affair of the present." (repetition and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Such as it is, if it cannot be obtained now, it can never be obtained." (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "And, on the last day of the year, on the eve of a renewed effort, our thoughts may profitably be centered..." (repetition of "on")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Evil cannot therefore be a positive principle; it signifies only the falling short of perfection." (sudden shift in argument without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from philosophical argument to a personal question ("Well," I hear you exclaiming...), disrupting the flow.  
- [CLARITY] "The hemlock would save them a lot of weary waiting." (unclear reference to "hemlock")  
- [LOGIC] "Real happiness consists first in acceptance of the fact that discontent is a condition of life..." (sudden shift in tone and focus)  
- [TRANSITION] "It is for the multiplication and intensification of these phenomena that Christmas, the thing, exists." (awkward transition and unclear reference to "the thing")  
- [LOGIC] "Our thoughts may profitably be centered upon a plan of campaign..." (sudden conclusion without clear connection to previous ideas)
