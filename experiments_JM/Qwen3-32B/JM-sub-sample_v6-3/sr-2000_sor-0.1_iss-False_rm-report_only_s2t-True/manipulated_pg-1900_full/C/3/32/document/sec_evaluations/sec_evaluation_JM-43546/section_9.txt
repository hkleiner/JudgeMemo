Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the battle begun" should be "the battle began"  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" appears multiple times and is likely a typo for "the stuff" or another word  
- [GRAMMAR] "Ellen's the stuff" is grammatically incorrect and confusing  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (repeated) is likely a typo  
- [GRAMMAR] "a camping-place was soon found" is awkward phrasing  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the battle to the "haggis" and then to the summer holidays is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (battle, food, holidays) without smooth transitions  
- [CLARITY] The repeated use of "a stuff" and "the stuff" creates confusion and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the battle scene to the picnic and historical references is jarring and lacks logical progression  
- [TRANSITION] The connection between the battle and the subsequent picnic is unclear and abrupt  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
