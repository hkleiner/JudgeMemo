Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo should supply themselves..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (likely a typo or misused term)  
- [GRAMMAR] "One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one morning..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is needless to say that positions in a stuff and Iloilo were now at a premium." (confusing and likely incorrect use of "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Of course, this diplomatic move tided affairs over..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the city 'intra muros' and the new city which has sprung up around it." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Realizing what consternation would be created throughout the United States by such a message, two of the teachers leaped into a carriage..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing until by courtesy it had been sent to the President." (confusing and likely incorrect use of "a thing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "We were several miles from the shore and nothing in sight indicated that we had reached a place of any importance." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "So our first impressions on coming on deck were that we had run aground." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff" is used multiple times without clear meaning, disrupting logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the teachers' meeting to the cablegram to the President is confusing and lacks clear cause-effect.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the teachers' situation to the arrival in Bacalod without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The use of "a thing" in multiple contexts (e.g., "a thing until by courtesy it had been sent to the President") is unclear and disrupts coherence.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the teachers' situation in Manila to the arrival in Bacalod without sufficient context or transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the town and the troops is detailed but lacks a clear narrative thread connecting it to the main story.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the native woman and her actions with the soldier is detailed but feels disconnected from the broader narrative.
