Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "so much so much so that" (repetition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was exasperating to think of the public spirit at Egypt, and contrast it with the state of things at a stuff." ("a stuff" is unclear and likely a placeholder or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Her comment to a thing, as she went to her virtuous couch that night" ("to a thing" is unclear and likely a placeholder or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mis’ Butterfield won’t be there; you’ll go int’ the orchard..." (contraction "int’" is inconsistent with formal writing style)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mis’ Butterfield wont be there" (missing apostrophe in "wont")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It would ’a’ be’n perfect if there’d be’n anybody to shed tears." (inconsistent use of contractions and informal phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mrs. Butterfield lived in a thing, but spent her summers in Edgewood on account of her chickens." ("a thing" is unclear and likely a placeholder or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had seen it only once before when she had drives, out from a stuff, years ago, with her aunt." ("a stuff" is unclear and likely a placeholder or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The father was almost always away from home; his sister kept the house, and Lyddy stayed in the nursery..." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Forty—that is rather old to be interesting, but age is a relative matter." (awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a stuff" appears multiple times as a placeholder or error, disrupting logical flow and clarity  
- [LOGIC] "a thing" appears multiple times as a placeholder or error, disrupting logical flow and clarity  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Aunt Hitty's funeral planning to Lyddy Butterfield's backstory and then to her current life in Edgewood, with minimal transition  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "He shall daily joy dispense / Hid in song’s sweet influence" is introduced without clear connection to the preceding narrative  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Lyddy Butterfield came into her kingdom" but does not clearly define what is meant by "kingdom" in this context  
- [LOGIC] The narrative includes a detailed backstory about Lyddy's childhood accident and subsequent isolation, but the connection to her current life in Edgewood is not clearly established  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the language of passion fresh and rooted as the lovely leafage about a spring" without clear context or explanation
