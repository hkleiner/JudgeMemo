Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I must have walked fully a kilometer from that station, when, asking once more to be directed to the Hotel du Commerce, I was told that I stood before it." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "As the dining room beyond and, no doubt, the hotel itself, was crowded with officers..." (subject-verb agreement error: "was" should be "were")  
- [SPELLING] "déjeûner" (uncommon spelling may be intentional but could be distracting)  
- [SYNTAX] "I returned to the office. There was now an older woman there..." (repetition of "there" is redundant and awkward)  
- [LEXICON] "Turpentine I felt would avail not in this hotel..." (unusual phrasing; "avail not" is archaic and awkward)  
- [SYNTAX] "I did not even want to look at the upper rooms." (sudden shift in tone and structure without transition)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from describing the hotel to the office and then to the streets is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the narrator’s experiences in the hotel, the streets, and the military headquarters without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the letter given me by the War Office" is mentioned without prior context, making it confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dining room to the office and then to the streets is disjointed and lacks smooth progression.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the hospitals is introduced abruptly after the military encounter, with no clear narrative link.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
