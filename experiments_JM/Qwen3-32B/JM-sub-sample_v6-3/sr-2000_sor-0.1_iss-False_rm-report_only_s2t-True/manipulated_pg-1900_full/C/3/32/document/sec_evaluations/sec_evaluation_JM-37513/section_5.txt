Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the fundamental attribute of all modes of change--that every cause produces more than one effect--is itself spoken of as a cause"  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "we are told of phenomena continually complicating under the influence of the same original factors'"  
- [SPELLING] "smudgy" is an informal or nonstandard word choice  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "And these formulae are found to be generally applicable where like things are in a like field of relatedness."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and complex vocabulary that may hinder clarity for some readers  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Spencer to Bertrand Russell and Mach without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical concepts and specific examples without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "Source" is introduced but not clearly defined or consistently explained  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs discussing different aspects of cause, force, and energy  
- [LOGIC] The argument about energy as a "ratio of variables" is introduced but not clearly connected to the broader discussion of cause and effect
