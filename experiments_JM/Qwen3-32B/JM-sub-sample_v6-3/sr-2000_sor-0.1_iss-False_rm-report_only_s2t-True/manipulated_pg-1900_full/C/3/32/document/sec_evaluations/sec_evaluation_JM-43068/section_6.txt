1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff" (likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff" (repeated multiple times, likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "the late thing" (likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "to a thing" (likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [SPELLING] "the Man with the thing" (likely a placeholder or typo)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The prices which Millet obtained for this series of remarkable works was fantastically small" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It then passed through several hands before the late thing competed up to 160,000 francs before he became possessed of the prize at the John Wilson sale" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a syndicate now came upon the scene, who took it to a thing" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "whilst he accounted himself lucky to encounter an amateur who gave him the same sum for the small 'Woman feeding Fowls.'" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the Louvre, and even desired a friend to inquire if he could not obtain reproductions of the frescoes at Herculaneum and Pompeii" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" without clear meaning disrupts logical flow  
- [LOGIC] "the late thing" and "to a thing" are unclear and disrupt the narrative  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Millet's financial struggles to the sale of "Angelus" is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the Man with the thing" is confusing and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The section on the commission for the Seasons is introduced abruptly and lacks clear connection to the previous paragraph  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the death of Rousseau is introduced abruptly after a detailed financial and artistic discussion  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Millet's life (financial struggles, artistic output, personal relationships) without clear transitions  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is occasionally disjointed, with some sentences or phrases not clearly connected to the main idea
