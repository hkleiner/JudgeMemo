- [SYNTAX] "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked with the accumulations of the knowledge they have absorbed that they can produce little or nothing." (long and complex sentence structure)

- [CLARITY] "Hebrew is one example among many of a language outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech" (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical examples and modern references without clear transitions, making the overall structure feel disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] "In any Roman Catholic church in the stuff to-day you will find the service conducted in a language..." (placeholder text disrupts logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "The recent revelation of racial arrogance in a thing has provided our enemies with a new weapon" (placeholder text disrupts logical flow and meaning)  
- [LOGIC] "As he talks to-day at the stuff and the thing" (placeholder text disrupts logical flow and meaning)
