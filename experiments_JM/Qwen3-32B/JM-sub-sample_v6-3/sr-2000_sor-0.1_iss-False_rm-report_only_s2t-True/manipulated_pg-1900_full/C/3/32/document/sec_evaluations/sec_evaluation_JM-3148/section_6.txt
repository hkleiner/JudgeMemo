- [SPELLING] "’t I can call in after dark" – inconsistent or non-standard punctuation.  
- [SYNTAX] "I said to a thing last night I should stand it till ’bout Friday" – unclear syntax and confusing structure.  
- [LEXICON] "She may be bleachin’ of ’em out, but it looks slack" – informal and ambiguous phrasing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "no, I don’t mean warmed, for most o’ the heathens live in hot climates, somehow or ’nother" – inconsistent punctuation and informal contractions.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I should go over and offer to help her" – missing article or preposition.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She has a fire in the settin’-room ’most every night" – informal contractions and missing prepositions.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I’m going home late to-night, and walk down on that side o’ the river" – missing auxiliary verb for parallel structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "so ’t I can call in after dark and see what makes her house light up as if the sun was settin’ inside of it" – awkward phrasing and non-standard grammar.

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The thing felt a little less bitter and hopeless about life" – unclear reference to "The thing," which may refer to Lyddy but is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] "The music had a curious effect upon her. It was a hitherto unknown influence in her life, and it interpreted her, so to speak, to herself" – abstract and vague phrasing that is difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] "She drew nearer, and saw a middle-aged man sitting in the kitchen doorway, with a lad of ten or twelve years leaning against his knees" – abrupt transition from describing the music to describing the musician.  
- [LOGIC] "What wonder if to her the music and the musician became one?" – the logic of this statement is unclear and lacks a clear connection to the previous paragraph.  
- [CLARITY] "When he played on his violin, it was as if the miracle of its fashioning were again enacted" – metaphor is complex and lacks clarity.  
- [LOGIC] "One might indeed have sung of this little red violin—that looked to Lyddy, in the sunset glow, as if it were veneered with rubies" – the connection between the violin and the metaphor is not clearly explained.  
- [LOGIC] "The viol ‘whispers in enamoured tone’" – the transition to quoting poetry is abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the narrative.
