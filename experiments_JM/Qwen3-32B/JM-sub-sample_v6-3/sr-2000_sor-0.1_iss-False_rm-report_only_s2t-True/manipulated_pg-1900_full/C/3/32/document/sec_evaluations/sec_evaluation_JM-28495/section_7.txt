Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Dashes used inconsistently and without proper spacing  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the commercial traveler, who was mechanically groping under the seat for his boots,--commercial travelers always remove their boots in third-class railroad compartments when on night journeys,--followed the curate's advice..."  
- [LEXICON] Use of "bouleversement" is obscure and may confuse readers  
- [SPELLING] "bouleversement" is a misspelling of "bouleversement" (likely intended to be "bouleversement" or "upset")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He spoke at the direction of a big man in a heavy overcoat..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "Excalibur" without prior context may confuse readers  
- [CLARITY] The transition from the train accident to the aftermath is abrupt and lacks smooth connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between multiple characters and locations without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] The commercial traveler's persistence in holding onto his boots seems illogical in the context of an emergency  
- [CLARITY] The final chapter's shift to a tramp at a rectory is disconnected from the previous narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
