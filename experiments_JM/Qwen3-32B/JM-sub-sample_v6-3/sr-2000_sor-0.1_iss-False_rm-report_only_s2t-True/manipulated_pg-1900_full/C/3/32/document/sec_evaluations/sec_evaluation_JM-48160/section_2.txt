- [LEXICON] "I sniffed and grumbled, but received nothing further but sympathy." (repetition of "nothing further but")

- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "the stuff" is used multiple times without clear reference (e.g., "the stuff in ‘70", "the thing")  
- [LOGIC] The author's reflections on French soldiers and their nerves are inserted without clear connection to the preceding narrative  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the author's trip to Châlons to the description of the hotel and the Bureau de Place is abrupt  
- [LOGIC] The author's interaction with the concièrge and the Bureau de Place is detailed but lacks clear connection to the overall narrative  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" is mentioned without prior context  
- [LOGIC] The author's internal monologue about being suspected of treachery is inserted without clear narrative purpose
