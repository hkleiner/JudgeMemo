Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff a professional way" (likely a typo or formatting error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not sure but that the raise in salary pleased me more than it did him" (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The janitor had now learned to know me fairly well. He found that we could work together..." (could be combined for smoother flow)  
- [LEXICON] "co√∂peration" (non-standard spelling; "cooperation" is more common)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the janitor story to the chapter on "How the Principal Can Help the Teacher" without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The questionnaire section is abruptly introduced without clear connection to the preceding narrative  
- [CLARITY] The section "a stuff a professional way" is confusing and likely a formatting or typographical error  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the janitor anecdote and the statistical data on teacher responses  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
