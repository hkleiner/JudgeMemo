Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was out of place in a ladies’ waiting room two poilus entered and attempted to induce him to leave." (Missing conjunction or punctuation between clauses)  
- [SPELLING] "stuff officer" (likely a typo for "staff officer")  
- [SPELLING] "The Marquise d’Andigné (who was Miss Goddard of a stuff)" (likely a typo for "staff")  
- [SYNTAX] "He was very drunk and he carried a gun almost as tall as himself." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "I had retrieved my belongings, visited the police, and there was nothing to do but make myself as comfortable as possible and read Dumas." (awkward transition between actions)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the soldier's behavior to the narrator's reflection on callousness without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events (e.g., the drunken soldier, the station, the War Office) without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "I now have a promise of a military automobile for a trip to Révigny, Nancy and Remiramont." (unclear how this connects to the previous narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] "All this, save for the heat, concerned me not at all." (abrupt ending with no clear connection to the preceding paragraph)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
