Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "I contrived however to make him answer a few more questions about it, though he did so with visible impatience." (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "He had formed the habit of depending on it, and if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own." (awkward syntax)
- [LEXICON] "He comes back to me from that last occasion—for I was never to speak to him again—as a man with some safe preserve for sport." (confusing phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "I wondered as I walked away where he had got _his_ tip." (underscore usage is unusual and potentially confusing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from the narrator's interaction with Vereker to the description of Corvick and Gwendolen is abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between different characters and perspectives without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "a thing" is unclear in several instances, creating confusion.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the narrator's personal reflections to the chessplayer imagery is jarring and lacks smooth transition.
