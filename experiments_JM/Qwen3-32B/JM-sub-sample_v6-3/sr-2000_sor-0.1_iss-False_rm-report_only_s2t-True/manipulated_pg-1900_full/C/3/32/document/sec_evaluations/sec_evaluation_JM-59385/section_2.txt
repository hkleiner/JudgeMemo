Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter had been a trifle curt." – Ambiguous reference to "the latter."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The utter futility of attempting to make East and a thing understand each other..." – Grammatically incorrect and confusing phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "la stuff roses" – Likely a typo or misphrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia" – Awkward and fragmented sentence structure.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Outside, the chair-bearers, trained to patience by long hours, waited. Wherein there is a wedding..." – Sudden shift in tone and structure disrupts flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from the emotional conflict between Kuei Ping and Miss Porter to the wedding ceremony with no clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section shifts abruptly from the memory of the school to the wedding preparations, making the narrative flow disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the latter had been a trifle curt" is unclear and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The phrase "Wherein there is a wedding..." is jarring and does not smoothly connect to the preceding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the wedding preparations and the soothsayers’ role is detailed but lacks a clear connection to the earlier emotional conflict.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
