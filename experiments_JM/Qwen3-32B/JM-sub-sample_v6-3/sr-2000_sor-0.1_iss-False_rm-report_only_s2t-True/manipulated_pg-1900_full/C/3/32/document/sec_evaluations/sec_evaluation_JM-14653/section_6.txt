Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the person will ever be quite 'done,' human nature, still being human..." lacks a subject and is grammatically incomplete.  
- [SPELLING] "deficiences" is misspelled; the correct spelling is "deficiencies."  
- [SYNTAX] "the first object of my attentions. I can then regard that person as 'done.' I can put him on a shelf..." is awkwardly structured and lacks smooth transition.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the sentence: "the person will ever be quite 'done,' human nature, still being human..."  
- [SYNTAX] "the affair of his heart being immensely more important..." is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the discussion of goodwill to the metaphor of learning foreign languages is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the "critic with that terrible English trait" is disjointed and does not clearly support the main argument.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the affair of his heart being immensely more important..." is vague and lacks a clear explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the discussion of Christmas to the conclusion about happiness is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about happiness is introduced suddenly and lacks a clear link to the previous discussion of goodwill and Christmas.
