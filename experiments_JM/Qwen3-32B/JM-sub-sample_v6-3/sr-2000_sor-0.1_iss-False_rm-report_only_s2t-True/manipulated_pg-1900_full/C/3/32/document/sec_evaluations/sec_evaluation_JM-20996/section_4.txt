Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The last course was dulce. The new-comers to the stuff will not be long..." (shift in tense from past to future without clear transition)  
- [SPELLING] "idylic" (misspelled; should be "idyllic")  
- [LEXICON] "the stuff" (repeated multiple times; vague and informal)  
- [SYNTAX] "for, as soon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the next was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the others at the table." (awkward phrasing and word order)  
- [SPELLING] "St. Vitus" (inconsistent capitalization; should be "St. Vitus")  
- [GRAMMAR] "My eyes must have told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she smiled upon me sweetly..." (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)  
- [SPELLING] "Terpsichore" (correct but uncommon word; may be distracting to some readers)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money; that they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a table loaded with good things was a fact..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "the last course was dulce. The new-comers to the stuff will not be long in making the acquaintance of this dish..." (shift in tense and unclear reference to "new-comers")  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the dinner to the dance is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Repeated use of "the stuff" without clear definition or context.  
- [LOGIC] "St. Vitus let go my companion and seized me with such vigor..." (metaphorical language is confusing and lacks clarity)  
- [LOGIC] "we broke up house-keeping and went boarding again, choosing that as the less of the two evils." (sudden shift in narrative without clear reasoning)  
- [LOGIC] "the rice from a thing, the salt from a thing..." (vague and confusing references to "a thing")  
- [LOGIC] "But let him who intends living well in the stuff on a small income bid farewell at once to so idylic a dream..." (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)
