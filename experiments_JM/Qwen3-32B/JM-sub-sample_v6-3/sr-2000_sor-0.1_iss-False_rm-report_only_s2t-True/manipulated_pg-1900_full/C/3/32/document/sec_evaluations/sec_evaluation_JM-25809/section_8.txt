Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "stuff' arrival" (missing apostrophe)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He couldn't do nothing" (double negative)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was a decent sort of feller" (nonstandard dialectal phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I'll have to give a complete history when I get back" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I thought to myself before we got under way, 'Now, there won't nothing happen this day'" (double negative and awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Jim's responsibility for the boy to Bud's story about the boy's father and the violent incident (lack of smooth transition)  
- [CLARITY] "He used a knife a foot long--gave it to her a dozen times as hard as he could drive" (vague and potentially disturbing phrasing)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Jim's thoughts and Bud's recounting of events without clear markers  
- [TRANSITION] "He couldn't do nothing, and he never loved that black-muzzled whelp from the time he sassed him in the depot" (abrupt and unclear connection)  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Bud's story to his description of the inspector is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative thread
