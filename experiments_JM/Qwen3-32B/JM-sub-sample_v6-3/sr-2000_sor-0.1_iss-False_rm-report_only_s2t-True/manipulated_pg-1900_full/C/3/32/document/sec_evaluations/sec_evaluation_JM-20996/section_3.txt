Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The work of the teachers was, in short; to 'make the English language the basis of instruction in the public schools.'" (Misuse of semicolon after "in short")  
- [GRAMMAR] "instruction would be free to all who came" (Awkward phrasing; "free to all who came" is grammatically correct but stylistically weak)  
- [SPELLING] "nippa hut" (Possibly a misspelling or non-standard term; should be "nipa hut")  
- [SPELLING] "Bacalod is a typical Philippine town. As we landed, a broad open square was spread out before us." (Minor repetition of "was" in adjacent sentences)  
- [SYNTAX] "The boat's crew elevated their trousers' legs also and slided down into the water." (Awkward phrasing and incorrect verb form "slided")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The curtain had fallen upon a drama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen or ever expected to see." (Sudden shift from narrative to reflective conclusion without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] "Depth of passion, depth of love! Who can fathom the human heart?" (Interrupts the narrative flow and feels disconnected from the preceding paragraph)  
- [CLARITY] "The official report of the result is as follows:" (Abrupt transition to a report without clear connection to the preceding narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] "Thus it can be easily seen that we were indeed pioneers." (Sudden summary statement that lacks smooth transition from the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "The Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education, so separate schools were to be started for the boys and the girls." (Assumes reader knowledge of cultural context without explanation)
