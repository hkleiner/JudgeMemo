Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was trying to capture him"—Shirtliffe’s thoughts had never been clearer, and his words *seem* to flow unconsciously—  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is mischief on foot, and we must hurry on." (fragmented sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The real thing might return at any minute, Robert did not know he had come and gone..." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and to the thing himself. That would mean sure death..." (repetition of "thing" without clarification)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He sprang to the saddle, and the tired horse jumped as the weight touched his sore flesh." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was none too soon. The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe, with bowed head dashed on, Morley on his return beat, came up to the group:" (run-on sentence and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s coming!” he shouted sitting upright in the saddle. “a stuff and fourteen thousand men! We are saved, saved! saved!” (inconsistent capitalization and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was too weary to open his eyes or to care what became of him, but suddenly a voice from among the others first startled, then stilled his breath." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him." (awkward repetition and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The real thing might return at any minute, Robert did not know he had come and gone..." (unclear reference to "the real thing" and "Robert")  
- [LOGIC] "and not be taken into the camp of the thing and presented to them who knew the true thing better, and to the thing himself." (repetition and confusion of "thing")  
- [LOGIC] "He sprang to the saddle, and the tired horse jumped as the weight touched his sore flesh. It was none too soon. The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe, with bowed head dashed on, Morley on his return beat, came up to the group:" (confusing sequence of events)  
- [LOGIC] "He’s coming!” he shouted sitting upright in the saddle. “a stuff and fourteen thousand men! We are saved, saved! saved!” (confusing use of "a stuff")  
- [LOGIC] "He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him." (unclear reference to "the other boy" and the Britisher)  
- [LOGIC] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him." (confusing narrative about the Britisher and the dead boy)  
- [LOGIC] "He’s coming!” he shouted sitting upright in the saddle. “a stuff and fourteen thousand men! We are saved, saved! saved!” (confusing use of "a stuff")  
- [LOGIC] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him." (confusing narrative about the Britisher and the dead boy)
