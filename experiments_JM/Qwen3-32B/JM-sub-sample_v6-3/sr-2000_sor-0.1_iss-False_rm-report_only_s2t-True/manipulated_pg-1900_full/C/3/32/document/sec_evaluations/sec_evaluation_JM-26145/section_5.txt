Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Gold did not tempt him; he asked modestly for silver in return for copper, for oil, textiles and manufactured articles in return for wood for building." (awkward phrasing and missing commas for clarity)  
- [SYNTAX] "he asked modestly for silver in return for copper, for oil, textiles and manufactured articles in return for wood for building." (repetition of "in return for" without proper coordination)  
- [LEXICON] "the thing" (ambiguous reference, unclear antecedent)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "he asked modestly for silver in return for copper, for oil, textiles and manufactured articles in return for wood for building."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "the thing" is used repeatedly without clear antecedent, causing confusion in understanding the narrative  
- [CLARITY] The text references "a stuff" and "the thing" without clear identification, making it difficult to follow the relationships between characters  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different characters and events without clear transitions, making it challenging to follow the sequence of events  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the letter to Teye to the discussion of Tushratta's ultimatum is abrupt and lacks smooth transition  
- [CONSISTENCY] The use of "the thing" and "a stuff" is inconsistent and confusing, affecting the reader's ability to track the narrative
