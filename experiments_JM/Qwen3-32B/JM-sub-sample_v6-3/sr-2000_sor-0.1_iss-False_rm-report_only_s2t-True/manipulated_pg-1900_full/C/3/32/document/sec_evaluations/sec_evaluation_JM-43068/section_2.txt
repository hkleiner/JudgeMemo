Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "that is at the period when French art..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff and Boucher" (likely a typo or missing name)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had not intended, in painting such a picture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists with its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him" (confusing phrasing; "dead to" is metaphorical but may be unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He could impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the mirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the delicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the branches." (missing comma after "water")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him" (jumps in logic; unclear how this connects to the shepherd's role)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from Millet's artistic philosophy to his early life is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "The only evidence of revolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert Robert and Moreau." (unclear reference to "such a state of affairs")  
- [TRANSITION] "But after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France was under the domination of Napoleon..." (sudden shift in topic without clear transition)  
- [LOGIC] "He wanted to make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson." (vague and lacks clear connection to the preceding discussion)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
