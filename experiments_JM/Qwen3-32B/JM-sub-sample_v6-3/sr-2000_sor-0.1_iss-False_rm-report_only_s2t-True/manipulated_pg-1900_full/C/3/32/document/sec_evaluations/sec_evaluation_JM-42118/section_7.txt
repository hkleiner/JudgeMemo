2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "stuff" and "thing" without clear meaning disrupts the logical flow and understanding of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently uses ambiguous or undefined terms (e.g., "a stuff," "the thing") that make it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the story of Fragonard to the political events of the French Revolution is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between personal events in Fragonard's life and broader historical events without clear linkage or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the death of a stuff" is unclear and confusing in the context of the French Revolution.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the far thing" in the context of Boston Harbour, which is unclear and disrupts the logical progression.  
- [LOGIC] The use of "a thing met for the first time" to refer to a political body is confusing and lacks clarity.
