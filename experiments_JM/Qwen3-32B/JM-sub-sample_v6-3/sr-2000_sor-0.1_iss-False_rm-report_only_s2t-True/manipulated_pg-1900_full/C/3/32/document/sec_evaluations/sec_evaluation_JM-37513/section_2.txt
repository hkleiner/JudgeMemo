- [SPELLING] "some the stuffain" (misspelled word)  
- [SYNTAX] "We can think of Matter only in terms of Mind. We can think of Mind only in terms of Matter." (repetition and redundancy)  
- [LEXICON] "the same evolution of the simple into the complex, through successive differentiations, holds throughout." (wordy and unclear phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "In a leading passage, at any rate, it is avowedly 'the persistence of some the stuffain..." (missing punctuation and formatting issues)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "the same evolution of the simple into the complex, through successive differentiations, holds throughout." (confusing reference to previous ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between abstract philosophical concepts and specific examples without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "the persistence of some the stuffain the development of Life upon its surface..." (unclear and disjointed sentence)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the author's personal reflections is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] "the more heterogeneous the products--inorganic, organic, and superorganic, as I learnt to call them--the stronger the evidence for the law." (unclear logical connection between heterogeneity and evidence)
