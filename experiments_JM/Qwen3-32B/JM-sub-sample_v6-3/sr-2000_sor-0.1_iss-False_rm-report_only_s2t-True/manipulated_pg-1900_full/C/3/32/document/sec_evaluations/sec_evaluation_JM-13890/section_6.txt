Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Prior Goldstone II. built between 1507 and 1517." (Misplaced period after "II")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing precincts" (Unclear reference to "the thing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing and Trinity Chapel" (Unclear reference to "a thing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Archbishop's the stuff" (Unclear reference to "the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Prior the stuff and finished in 1378 by Prior Chillenden" (Unclear reference to "Prior the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the central space which contained a representation of the martyrdom of Becket still vacant since the days of a thing" (Unclear reference to "a thing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the effect of emptiness existing to-day is vastly different to what the pilgrims used to gaze upon" ("to" should be "from")  
- [SPELLING] "lierne" (Correct spelling is "lierne", but it is a technical term and may be acceptable)  
- [SYNTAX] "He walks down the lane trodden century after century by countless pilgrims and enters the thing precincts..." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the south arcades of this chapel, consisting of four Norman arches with an ivy-grown clerestory, is still standing" (Subject-verb agreement error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated and unclear references to "the thing" and "the stuff" (likely placeholders or errors) disrupt the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently references "the thing" and "the stuff" without clear antecedents, making it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptions of different parts of the cathedral and surrounding buildings without clear transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative lacks smooth transitions between the external and internal descriptions of the cathedral.  
- [LOGIC] The text references specific historical events and figures without sufficient context for a reader unfamiliar with the subject.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the cloister and chapter house is confusing due to the lack of clear spatial orientation.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from describing the cloister to the interior of the cathedral without a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the martyrdom of Becket" is mentioned without prior introduction, making it confusing for readers unfamiliar with the historical context.
