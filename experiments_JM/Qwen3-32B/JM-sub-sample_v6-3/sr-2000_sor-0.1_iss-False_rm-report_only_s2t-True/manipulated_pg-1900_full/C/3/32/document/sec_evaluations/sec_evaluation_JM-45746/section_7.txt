Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format" is an incomplete sentence and out of context.  
- [SPELLING] "To-day" is an archaic spelling; modern usage is "Today."  
- [SYNTAX] "It is this failure to be able to reach that visionary goal that discourages teachers..." is awkward and redundant.  
- [LEXICON] "I dare say the supervisors" is somewhat informal and may not fit the academic tone.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the sentence fragment "You must output only and exactly the following format" disrupts flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing the problem method in teaching to administrative and personal relationship topics without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the teacher who improved after being challenged lacks a clear connection to the broader theme of professional leadership.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on professional leadership to administrative practices is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [CLARITY] The final sentence "Try it!" is abrupt and lacks context, making it feel disconnected from the preceding discussion.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section is divided into numbered and lettered subsections, but the organization is inconsistent and confusing.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
