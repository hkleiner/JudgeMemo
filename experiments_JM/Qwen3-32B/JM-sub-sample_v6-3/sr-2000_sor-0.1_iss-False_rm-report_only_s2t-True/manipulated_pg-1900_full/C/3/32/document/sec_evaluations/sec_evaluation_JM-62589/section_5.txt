Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A thing trained muscles had all they could do to stand up against Robert’s blind fury." (awkward phrasing and unclear subject)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The ball which had gone through the stuff hand had found a resting place in the old man’s breast." (incorrect use of "stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "For one moment near things lost their hold upon him" (unclear and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff, child, I’ve been drinking again, to—morrow I’ll tell you the story." (incorrect use of "stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The thing waited beside the road, until the pain in his hand turned him sick" (awkward phrasing and unclear subject)  
- [GRAMMAR] "They were the stuff and had evidently ridden fast and far upon important business." (incorrect use of "stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The man called Dick" (missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He must chance it at any rate; so slowly descending he made his way toward the men." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had heard of the daredevil boy Morley from others in camp, this was his first encounter." (awkward phrasing and missing transition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format" (not part of the text, but included for reference)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the thing" and "stuff" repeatedly without clear definition, making it difficult to follow who or what is being referred to.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts between Robert, Morley, and "the thing" without clear transitions, causing confusion.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift in time and perspective from the dying man to Robert hiding is abrupt and lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The dialogue between the riders and Robert is confusing due to the unclear identity of the characters and the use of ambiguous terms.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Debby Mason" and the dying man's final words are emotionally impactful but lack sufficient context to fully understand their significance.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of historical events like "Washington and his ten thousand men" is jarring and lacks integration into the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of the riders and their dialogue disrupts the emotional tone of the scene without clear motivation.  
- [LOGIC] The use of "the thing" and "stuff" as descriptors for characters and objects is inconsistent and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the death of Mason to Robert's hiding and the arrival of the riders is abrupt and lacks narrative cohesion.  
- [LOGIC] The final dialogue between Robert and the riders is confusing due to the unclear motivations and identities of the characters.
