Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "It was the girl. Darn her hide, she was beautiful!" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)
- [SPELLING] "abrevitog" (likely a misspelling or neologism that is not clearly defined)
- [SYNTAX] "They were speaking in English. The Vegan girl tugged at Ramsey's arm." (sudden shift in subject without clear transition)
- [LEXICON] "toggle-cloak of green Irwadian fur" (unclear or overly specific neologism)
- [SYNTAX] "Ramsey took the gun. Their hands met. Ramsey leaned forward quickly and kissed her on the lips." (choppy and abrupt sentence structure)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] "I was on the Polaris today, Captain. You were to be the pilot, until a stuff here on Irwadi was planetarized." (unclear reference to "a stuff" and "planetarized")
- [CLARITY] "My name is Margot Dennison, Captain Ramsey. I have managed to buy an old starship, small and held together by spit and string and whatever the Irwadians use for a thing" (unclear reference to "a thing")
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from action to description to dialogue without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] "Ramsey and the Vegan girl had come on foot. It was a long walk." (sudden mention of their mode of travel without prior context)
- [CLARITY] "She had firm, long legs, and used them well. She was utterly lovely and although part of it was probably her professional know-how, she made you forget that." (vague and subjective description that lacks narrative purpose)
