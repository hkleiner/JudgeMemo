Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect use of "a thing" and "a stuff" in place of specific nouns.  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing articles or prepositions in phrases like "a thing was wrong" and "at a stuff."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in sentences such as "I’ve taught you to read, Deb, when the schools shut their doors on you."  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders, which disrupts fluency.  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent use of archaic and modern language, creating confusion.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Use of "a thing" and "a stuff" as placeholders breaks the logical flow and makes it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Lack of specific details in key locations and events (e.g., "a thing regiment," "a stuff") hinders understanding.  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in focus between Debby’s emotional state and the broader war narrative disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between dialogue and narrative sections make the progression feel disjointed.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent use of character names and references (e.g., "Abner Andrews" vs. "old fellow by the name of the thing") confuse the reader.
