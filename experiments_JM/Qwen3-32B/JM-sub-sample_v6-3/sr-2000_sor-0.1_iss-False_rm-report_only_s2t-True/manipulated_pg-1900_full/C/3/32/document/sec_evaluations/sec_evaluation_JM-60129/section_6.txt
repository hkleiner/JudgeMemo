Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "wre reached the bottom" instead of "we reached the bottom"  
- [GRAMMAR] "to the thing" (repeated multiple times without clear meaning)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a stuff" and "the stuff" (used inconsistently without definition)  
- [SPELLING] "t'umu" and "Yögurs" (non-standard spellings, but not errors if consistent)  
- [SYNTAX] "Still followed on the right by the same fir-bordered mountain crest, which we saw in K'anglungssu to the thing, we rode over a high, undulating plain..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "a thing" and "the thing" (used repeatedly without clear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "The ride down from the heights was if possible even steeper than our ride up..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "K'anglungssu" and "Hei-ho" (non-standard spellings, but not errors if consistent)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a thing" and "the thing" are used repeatedly without explanation, making the text confusing  
- [CLARITY] "a stuff" and "the stuff" are used inconsistently and without definition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptions of geography, people, and historical documents without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the t'umu" and "the lamas" without sufficient introduction for a reader unfamiliar with the context  
- [LOGIC] The document mentions "Tangutá" and "Seche-Hache" without providing enough background for clarity  
- [LOGIC] The text references "K'ang-hsi" and "Dungan revolt" without sufficient context for a general reader  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from descriptions of the landscape to administrative details and then to historical documents
