Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing's mother promised to take care of him" (ambiguous antecedent for "the thing's mother")  
- [GRAMMAR] "So that the only thing that marred Don's pleasure was the last look of 'doggie,' whining sadly in Mrs. MacPherson's arms" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "doggie")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was a rainy little country, and hardly a day passes without some rain falling" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There would be no use in staying indoors, for this is the way it is most of the time" (redundant phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Skylemore" (possibly a misspelling or non-standard name, but not clearly incorrect)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "the thing" (unclear reference, likely a placeholder or error, which disrupts understanding)  
- [LOGIC] "the stuff" (repeated use of "a stuff" and "the stuff" without clear meaning, likely placeholder errors)  
- [LOGIC] "the thing churchyard" (unclear reference to "the thing churchyard")  
- [LOGIC] "the thing all think our own town the handsomest" (unclear reference to "the thing all")  
- [LOGIC] "the children went back to a stuff tired, but happy" (unclear reference to "a stuff")
