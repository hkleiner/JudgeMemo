Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "She read, too, in the repeated calls from his household for their return more than just the desire to enforce old traditions."  
- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing in "She saw thus now because she measured their love not by her need of him, but by his need of her."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward structure in "She saw her path of service within her own small world first in ministering to those who had need of her and then perhaps out through them to others."  
- [SPELLING] "Fuh Tang" is inconsistently capitalized in some instances.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The street was packed with slow-moving holiday makers and with vendors who cried their wares and made sales in the midst of traffic..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The chairs wound out of the Street of Precious Pearls and on through the streets along which Kuei Ping had passed on her wedding day."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Her husband seemed to gather new strength as they passed through ways he had known in boyhood."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The duties of attendance upon the family altar and the dropping of daily rice before the Kitchen God were continued by the widow of the deceased son."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "They heard him say that when he grew up he was going to be an Emperor and ride along a golden road at the head of a big procession."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The years that followed were but the melting together of the pearls of Kuei Pingâ€™s life."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the emotional reflection on Kuei Ping's life to the poetic lines "Wherein / twenty-seven / slow years / are added / one upon / another" without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the poetic lines to the narrative about the years melting together, which feels disconnected.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and perspectives without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The line "the big city that is a stuff" is unclear and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the festival scene to the poetic lines "Wherein / there is / patience / and tenderness / and understanding / and a / return to / a little / home village" is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts from the present moment of the procession to a reflection on the years that followed without a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The ending is abrupt, with the death of Fuh Tang introduced suddenly after a long period of hope and joy.
