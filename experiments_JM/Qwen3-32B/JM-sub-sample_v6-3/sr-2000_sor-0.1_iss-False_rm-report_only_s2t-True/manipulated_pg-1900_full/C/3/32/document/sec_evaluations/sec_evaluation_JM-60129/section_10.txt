Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "reined iu my horse" (likely a typo for "reined in my horse")  
- [SPELLING] "tshuavá and sujá" (unusual spelling, possibly non-standard or phonetic, but not clearly explained)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the surface of the rock was often visible" (awkward phrasing; could be rephrased for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the river forming a wide bend, open to the north, pours its waters..." (awkward syntax; missing prepositions or commas for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "they precipitate themselves headlong down to the water along the left shore" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "discribed" (misspelling of "described")  
- [SPELLING] "thing" (unclear reference; possibly a typo or misused word)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the yamen (the official building of the mandarin) destroyed in the stuff revolt" (missing article; "the stuff revolt" is unclear)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the landscape to the town of Li-yen without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] "the reception accorded me was like that discribed by a thing" (unclear reference to "a thing")  
- [LOGIC] "the yamen destroyed in the stuff revolt" (unclear reference to "stuff revolt")  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves through multiple locations and descriptions with minimal transitions, making the flow somewhat disjointed  
- [CLARITY] "the deaf old gentlemen's politeness went so far as to promise me on my next visit (!) five sable skins" (sudden shift in tone and unclear use of "(!)")
