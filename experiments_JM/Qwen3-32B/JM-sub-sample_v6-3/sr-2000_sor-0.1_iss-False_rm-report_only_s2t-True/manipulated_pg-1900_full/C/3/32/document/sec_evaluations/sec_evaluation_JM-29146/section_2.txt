Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He did not look back at the Polaris, marooned indefinitely on Irwadi despite anything the Centaurian owners or anyone else for that matter could do about it." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had an stuff-style name..." (Typo: "stuff" should be "stiff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was a short, very slender man a few years older than Ramsey, who was thirty-one." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Not when the folks back in Capella and Deneb and Sol System hear about it." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He got off the bed and shook Ramsey's hand solemnly. Ramsey gave him three hundred and seventy-five credits and said: 'Just see you make that go a long way supporting Sally and the kids. I don't want to see you dropping any of it at the gaming tables. I'll knock your block off if I see you there.'" (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had only three credits left. If he risked them now, there wouldn't even be the temporary physical relief and release of a bottle of Irwadian brandy before hitting the sack." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format..." (Not an issue in the text, but included for reference)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Ramsey giving money to Englander to the gambling scene is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The anthropologist friend reference is introduced without context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from Ramsey's conversation with Englander to the gambling scene is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The drunk Irwadian's confrontation is introduced suddenly without clear setup or motivation.  
- [LOGIC] The final line about "You must output only and exactly the following format..." is irrelevant and disrupts the narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
