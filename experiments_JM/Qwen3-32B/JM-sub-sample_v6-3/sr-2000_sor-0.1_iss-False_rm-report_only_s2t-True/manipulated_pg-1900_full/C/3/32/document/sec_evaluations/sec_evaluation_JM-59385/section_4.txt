1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "She breathed a prayer of thanksgiving to a stuff that she had been given patience..." (incorrect use of "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "and that she had donned for the afternoon the most becoming of the wisteria silk garments..." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the stuff just west of the entrance to the Forbidden City..." (incorrect use of "stuff")  
- [SYNTAX] "Wherein a son is born and there is great rejoicing" (fragmented and stylistically awkward)  
- [LEXICON] "the thing and Chia" (unclear reference to "the thing")  
- [SPELLING] "Fuh Tang" (inconsistent capitalization of names in some contexts)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "She breathed a prayer of thanksgiving to a stuff that she had been given patience..." (confusing and illogical statement)  
- [CLARITY] "the thing and Chia" (unclear reference to "the thing," which disrupts understanding)  
- [STRUCTURE] "Wherein a son is born and there is great rejoicing" (disconnected from the surrounding narrative and stylistically jarring)  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's internal thoughts to the birth of the child with minimal transition  
- [LOGIC] "In humiliation Kuei Pingâ€™s heart was lighter than ever before" (contradictory phrasing that is confusing)
