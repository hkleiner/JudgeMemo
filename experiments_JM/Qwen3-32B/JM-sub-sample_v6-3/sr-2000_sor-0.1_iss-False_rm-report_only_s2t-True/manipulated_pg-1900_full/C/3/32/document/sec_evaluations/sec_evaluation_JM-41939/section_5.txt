Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "The thing" (repeatedly) appears to be a placeholder or error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The stuff" is used in place of specific terms, likely a placeholder or error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had the Stags at Long-Rocher on my easel" – inconsistent pronoun usage ("my" instead of "her").  
- [GRAMMAR] "I must have been a disappointment to Princess Metternich who amused herself..." – missing comma after "Metternich."  
- [GRAMMAR] "All that she obtained was a medal of the second class." – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The judges owed her a grudge because of her long neglect of twelve years." – awkward and unclear phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She divided the scheme of instruction into two series, one of the great studies of animals and the other of little studies." – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She made a show of authority, not to say severity." – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "She went into ecstacies before the splendour..." – misspelling of "ecstasies."  
- [GRAMMAR] "She planned for herself a laborious and tranquil existence, rendered all the pleasanter through the devoted and watchful affection of her old friend..." – awkward phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of "the thing" and "the stuff" disrupts the logical flow and makes the text confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The text references events and people without sufficient context, making it difficult to follow the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different periods in Rosa Bonheur's life without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the art school is inserted as a parenthesis, which disrupts the chronological flow of the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The text references the "war of 1870" without clearly connecting it to the preceding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of a Prussian officer and the "stuff" is confusing and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the Cartload of Stones" and other works without clearly linking them to the broader narrative.
