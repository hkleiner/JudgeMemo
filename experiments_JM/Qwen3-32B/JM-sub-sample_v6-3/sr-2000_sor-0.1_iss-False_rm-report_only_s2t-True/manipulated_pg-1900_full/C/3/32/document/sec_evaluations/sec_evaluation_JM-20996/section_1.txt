1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will prove to be pregnant with interest..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was on this day that the stuff sent from the thing four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women..." (unclear reference to "the stuff" and "the thing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in the stuff had just fallen..." (unclear reference to "the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Our last passenger whose silvery hair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in a heap on the deck." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We were alone." (sudden, abrupt ending to a paragraph)  
- [GRAMMAR] "No traveler who lands at the stuff will feel unrequited..." (unclear reference to "the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Bishop Museum of the stuff." (unclear reference to "the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "A naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from London to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in a stuff..." (unclear reference to "a stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The men wore hat, shirt, and pants..." (missing article "a" before "hat")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the same size at both bottom and top..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The upper end not being belted or tied, but just drawn tightly around the waist..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung loosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads of hair that almost any lady would be proud to own." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Many of the women had in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied with small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners chewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire." (awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated and unclear references to "the thing" and "the stuff" throughout the text (confusing and unresolved)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the historical narrative to the description of the Bishop Museum and then to surf-shooting (lack of smooth transition)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden insertion of a quote from "Century Magazine for September, 1889" without context or explanation (disrupts narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the description of the voyage to the description of Manila and its people (lack of smooth transition)  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly ends with "We were alone." without a clear connection to the following paragraph (disrupts narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] The description of the women's clothing is detailed but disconnected from the main narrative (lack of relevance)  
- [LOGIC] The description of the rainy season and wet clothing is introduced without clear connection to the previous narrative (lack of relevance)
