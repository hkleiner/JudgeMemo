Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A stuff being much divided in its attachment to Becket" is grammatically awkward and unclear.  
- [LEXICON] "The thing" is used repeatedly without clear antecedent, causing confusion.  
- [SYNTAX] "the marks of the stripes administered on the previous day being plainly visible" is a run-on phrase with poor structure.  
- [SPELLING] "superstitious belief in the efficacy of a martyr's blood" is correct, but the phrasing is awkward.  
- [SYNTAX] "the murder that the autocratic Archbishop who had not inspired universal admiration in his lifetime was soon to become the most frequently invoked of all the calendar of saints" is overly complex and confusing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the murder of Becket to the canonization process and then to the relics, with little transitional clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is disjointed, with unclear connections between the knights' actions, the monks' reactions, and the relics' value.  
- [CLARITY] The repeated use of "the thing" and "stuff" without clear reference makes the text confusing and hard to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the murder scene to the relics and then to Henry's penance is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Henry's penance and the subsequent military success is implied but not clearly explained.
