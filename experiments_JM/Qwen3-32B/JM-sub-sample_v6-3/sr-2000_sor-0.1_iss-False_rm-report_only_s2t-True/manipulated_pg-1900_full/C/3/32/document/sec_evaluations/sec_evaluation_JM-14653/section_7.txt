Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "in k more or less imperfect manner" (likely a typo for "in a more or less imperfect manner")  
- [SPELLING] "fete" is spelled correctly but may be less common and could be confusing to some readers  
- [SYNTAX] "Positive though he may be that a worldly ambition realised will produce the same dissatisfaction as Dead Sea fruit in the mouth, he will still continue fact." (awkward phrasing and incomplete sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "Dead Sea fruit" is a metaphor but may be obscure or confusing without context  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the "average successful man" to the broader philosophical discussion of ideals and New Year's resolutions is abrupt  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between introspective reflections and abstract philosophical arguments without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "Dead Sea fruit" is introduced without explanation, making it unclear to readers  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the "average successful man" to the general human condition lacks a smooth connection  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
