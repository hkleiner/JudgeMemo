Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "We may now pass to cause and conditions."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, e.g., "We need a term by which to designate that which is thus inherent..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract or technical terms without simplification, e.g., "in virtue of which an observable kind of change occurs."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation in long sentences, e.g., missing commas in "We may now pass to cause and conditions."  
- [STYLE] Repetition of phrases such as "One could wish..." and "I suggest that..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some ideas are introduced abruptly without clear transitions, e.g., the shift from "cause and conditions" to "the constitution of any system."  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract concepts and concrete examples without sufficient linkage.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "cause," "ground," and "condition" is occasionally unclear.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs, especially when moving from one philosophical concept to another.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The argument sometimes loses focus, e.g., the discussion of Spencerâ€™s work becomes tangential.
