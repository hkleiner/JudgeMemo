Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have found in the vast majority of cases that if the board has faith in the superintendent and feels that he knows what he wants, and what he will do with it after he gets it, he will not have much difficulty in obtaining what the school really needs." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [SYNTAX] "Too many superintendents go to board meetings with no definite report as to what is being done in the schools or what is really needed to make them efficient." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "succeeding fall" (should be "succeeding fall" is correct, but "succeeding" is a bit archaic and could be confusing)  
- [LEXICON] "We put ---- on the map in athletics." (use of "----" is unclear and may confuse the reader)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The last point did not necessarily eliminate the assistance that might be secured from outside coaches, provided they were made directly responsible to the school." (awkward phrasing and missing clarity)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the manual training section to the school activities chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Seattle high school principal is introduced without context or explanation, making it feel disconnected.  
- [CLARITY] The use of "----" in the sentence "We put ---- on the map in athletics" is unclear and disrupts the flow of the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing manual training to student activities is not clearly signaled, making the transition feel jarring.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the janitor and the literary society is somewhat disjointed from the broader discussion of school activities and leadership.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
