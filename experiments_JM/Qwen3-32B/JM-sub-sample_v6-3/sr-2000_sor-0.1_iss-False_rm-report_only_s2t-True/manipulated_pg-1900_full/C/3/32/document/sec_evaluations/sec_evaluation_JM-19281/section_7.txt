- [GRAMMAR] "the stuff Arab tribes" (likely a typo for "the various Arab tribes")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing's injunctions" (awkward phrasing; likely a reference to "the religion's injunctions")  
- [SPELLING] Repeated use of "stuff" in place of other words (likely a typo)  
- [SYNTAX] "It needs little insight to appreciate that clinging to primitive norms in the present day would defeat the very purpose of religion's patient cultivation of moral sense." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "No one familiar with the historical details will have difficulty in understanding the severity of the thing's injunctions on the subject." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff's metaphorical vision" (likely a typo for "the Book's" or "the scripture's")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the role of religion in shaping moral consciousness to the specific example of the Hebrew people and Muhammad without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from the discussion of crime and punishment to the broader historical context of religious dispensations without clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the stuff purpose" and similar errors disrupt the logical flow and clarity of the argument  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between multiple historical and religious examples without clear organization or thematic unity  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the discussion of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to the broader implications for the new age of human experience
