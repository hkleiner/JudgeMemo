Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Manifestations of God have appeared, have each been explicit as to the authority of His teachings" (awkward phrasing with repeated "have")  
- [SYNTAX] "He is indeed the Creator without a creation" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the Ancient Being, Who is still unknown of men" (uncommon phrasing that may confuse readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "counted on one's fingers" (sentence could be clearer with a comma or period)  
- [SPELLING] "revelation of God at its appearance" (awkward phrasing, could be "revelation of God when it appears")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Manifestations of God to the objection raised against the Bahá'í conception of religion (lack of smooth transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between abstract theological concepts and historical examples without clear signposting, making it difficult to follow the argument's flow  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "eternal" and "transitory" features of religion is introduced but not clearly elaborated in a way that is accessible to all readers  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of cultural evolution to religious evolution is abrupt and lacks a clear connecting sentence  
- [LOGIC] The use of multiple rhetorical questions ("What could have been the reason...") is effective but not clearly tied to the preceding argument, creating a slight disconnect  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
