Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The French trenches run through his northern estate" (passive voice could be clearer)  
- [LEXICON] "He will not be permitted to set foot on it before the end of the war unless his regiment happens to be ordered there" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "He would smile at hearing himself called a rich man to-day" (archaic phrasing may be distracting)  
- [SYNTAX] "Out of his invested capital he must pay high and ever higher taxes" (awkward word order)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "He is asked every day in the week for a subscription, and I believe he runs a hospital")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing a Frenchman's situation to addressing newspaper readers (lack of smooth transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph feels abrupt and less connected to the preceding narrative  
- [CLARITY] "He would smile at hearing himself called a rich man to-day" (unclear tone and implication)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Frenchman's story to the appeal for donations is abrupt  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
