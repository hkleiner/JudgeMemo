Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You couldn't say breathlessly" is awkward and grammatically unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "He blinked. The vision persisted, superimposed over a thing's figure as she walked toward the box." is awkward and confusing.  
- [LEXICON] "A thing's figure" is unclear and lacks specificity.  
- [SYNTAX] "He saw--or thought he saw--Margot Dennison in the costume she had worn when they first met." is slightly awkward in phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "insulined" is likely a typo for "insulated."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the vision to the physical confrontation is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "a thing" is unclear and inconsistent in meaning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between action, dialogue, and philosophical reflection without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden death of the space-suited figures due to "mental suggestion" is introduced without sufficient explanation or buildup.  
- [CLARITY] The identity and role of "a thing" are not clearly defined, leading to confusion.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
