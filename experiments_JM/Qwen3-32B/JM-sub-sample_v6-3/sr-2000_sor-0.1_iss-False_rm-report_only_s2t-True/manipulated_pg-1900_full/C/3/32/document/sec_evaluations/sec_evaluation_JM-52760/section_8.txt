Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "Rowanty Creek" (likely a typo, should be "Rowanty" or another correct name)  
- [GRAMMAR] "which has pushed northwest toward Five Forks" (subject-verb agreement error; "has" should be "had")  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "a thing" and "the stuff" in place of specific terms (likely placeholders or errors)  
- [GRAMMAR] "10,000 the stuff cavalry and 12,000 infantry" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SPELLING] "cold and hungry soldiers" (grammatically correct but awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent use of "a thing" and "the stuff" disrupts clarity and logical flow  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in focus between battles and broader strategic implications without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to "the thing" and "the stuff" make it difficult to follow the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between sections and events without sufficient context or explanation  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences are disconnected from the broader narrative, especially in the middle of battle descriptions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
