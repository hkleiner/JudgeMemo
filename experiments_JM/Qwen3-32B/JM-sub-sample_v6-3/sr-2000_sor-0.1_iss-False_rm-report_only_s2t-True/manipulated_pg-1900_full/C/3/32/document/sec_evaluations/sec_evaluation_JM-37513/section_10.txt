Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "That kind of self-awareness--if we must so call it!--is eminently characteristic of cognition in the higher forms of its development."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of complex or archaic phrasing that may hinder clarity, e.g., "cognitive relatedness," "ideal cognita," "physico-chemical relatedness."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and parentheses, which disrupts the flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous or unclear subject-verb agreement in some complex sentences.  
- [STYLE] Repetition of phrases like "we do not speak of parallelism" and "we should be content to say" without variation.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are abstract and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between multiple concepts (e.g., cognition, physiology, parallelism) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of certain terms (e.g., "cognitive relatedness," "ideal cognita") is not consistently clarified.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics, such as from "cognitive process" to "Spencer's identity hypothesis," without sufficient contextual linkage.  
- [COHESION] Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without clearly connecting to the previous ones.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
