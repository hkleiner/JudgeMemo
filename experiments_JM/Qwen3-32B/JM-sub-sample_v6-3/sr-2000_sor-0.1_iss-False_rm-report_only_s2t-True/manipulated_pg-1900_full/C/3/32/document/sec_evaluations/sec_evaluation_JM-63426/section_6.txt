- [GRAMMAR] "the full twenty-four hours--quite a change from the humble beginnings of the Wayside Press when one “Universal” and two “Gordon” job presses were believed sufficient for the magazine and booklet printing then planned." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Wayside Press as a unit, including name and goodwill and my own services, soon followed--a hurried and ill-conceived arrangement that eventually proved so mutually unsatisfactory that I faded out of the picture." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a thing" and "the stuff" are used repeatedly as placeholders, making the text confusing and disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different events and time periods without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The section abruptly shifts from the growth of the print shop to the interlude in New York without a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the business struggles to the anecdote with Richard Harding Davis is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the young man stepping off a horse-car feels disconnected from the previous business narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The use of placeholder text ("a thing" and "the stuff") disrupts the logical flow and makes the narrative incoherent.
