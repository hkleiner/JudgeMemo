Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "tshokh" is likely a misspelling or non-standard term.  
- [SPELLING] "illnes" is misspelled (should be "illness").  
- [SPELLING] "contrarys" is misspelled (should be "contrary").  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" is likely a typo for "a Tibetan" or similar.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The navel string is severed with a pair of scissors by an old woman, often the grandmother of the child." – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The parents of the bridegroom take no part in the festivities at the bride's house, nor do the bride's parents accompany their daughter, when she leaves her home." – missing comma after "daughter".  
- [GRAMMAR] "The number of deaths still outnumber the births." – subject-verb agreement issue ("outnumber" should be "outnumbers").  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is however possible..." – missing space between "It" and "is".  
- [GRAMMAR] "The words which I have noted and phonetically transcribed as heard among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs, are to be found in a table at the end of this brochure." – awkward phrasing and comma placement.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The number of births and deaths during the last ten years, in the nineteen homesteads we visited, and the number of live stock possessed by each family is shown in the following table:" – awkward phrasing and comma placement.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of customs to statistical data without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The section on statistics is presented without clear connection to the preceding cultural descriptions, making the shift jarring.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the statistics being potentially falsified is somewhat ambiguous and lacks clear logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the wedding to the section on births, deaths, and livestock is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about "vague statements" being "unintentionally wrong" is somewhat unclear in its relationship to the rest of the paragraph.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
