Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the sum of the square of the sides is equal to the square of the hyper-space" (incorrect phrasing of the Pythagorean theorem)  
- [SYNTAX] "the only two headed get yours here the sum of the square..." (fragmented and incoherent sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "mimsy were the borogroves and the momraths now what the heck did the momraths do anyhow" (nonsensical and ungrammatical phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff girl looked at Ramsey mutely" (inconsistent use of "the stuff" as a descriptor)  
- [SYNTAX] "The thing smiled at him. 'Thank you,' she said. 'Thank you, Ramsey.'" (awkward transition between "the thing" and "she")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey's internal monologue to dialogue without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Confusing sequence of thoughts in Ramsey's mind, making it hard to follow the narrative  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the thing" and "the stuff" without clear identification  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the internal monologue to the action of firing the gun  
- [LOGIC] Confusing explanation of how timelessness affects the gun's functionality and perception of music  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
