2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of "a stuff" and "a thing" without clear antecedents disrupts the logical flow and understanding of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The repeated use of "a thing" and "a stuff" creates confusion about which side is being referred to.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different events and descriptions without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the sequence of the battle.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative is occasionally unclear due to the repeated use of ambiguous terms like "a thing" and "a stuff," which disrupt the logical progression of the battle description.  
- [CLARITY] The use of "the lot of the Northern soldiers" is unclear and disrupts the reader's understanding of the situation.
