1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "To the women of America I dedicate this story of the life of my Chinese friend and teacher: it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [SYNTAX] "But I have found, for I like to visit the little shops on side streets, that the more precious jewels glow with a warmer brilliancy when the day outside is dark." (cumbersome structure)  
- [SPELLING] "tapestried box-like chairs" (likely should be "tapestry-covered")  
- [GRAMMAR] "They had traversed more than half the entire length of the street when Madame Yen’s chair came to a stop before a shop with rich filigree carvings and double entrance doors of heavy velvet with brass frames." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The head of the shop and his partners flicked their long-stemmed pipes from sleepy lips and rose, as though from deep meditation, struggling a bit with the light that would penetrate into their eyes, even in the darkened room, as they bowed, offering the courtesy of 'the miserable place to the pleasure of their honorable guests.'" (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Kuei Ping, lifting her gaze now and then from the floor, caught a glint of joy of the coming bargain in the corners of the shrewd old dealer’s mouth and in her grandmother’s eyes, even in the midst of courtesy and greeting." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Wong Lui had placed his best before them. Kuei Ping from under her modestly lowered lashes caught glimpses of bright eyes that glowed from the darkness of the inner rooms, the curious little clerks and underlings who peered through the dividing parchment, eagerly following the tableau in the center of the shop." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The girl, holding the jewels thus in her hand that she might feel their nearness, saw them glow into warmer color as she held them, as though her touch breathed life into them." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically, Kuei Ping was back in memory, as she was so often these days, at the little mission school where she had been sent when she could go no farther in lessons with her brothers at home." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from the jewelry shop scene to a memory of Kuei Ping at a mission school with no clear transition or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is descriptive and detailed, but the shift to the memory at the end feels disconnected from the preceding scene.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the memory about the mission school is unclear and does not seem to connect to the main narrative about the Street of Precious Pearls.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the jewelry shop to the memory is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
