2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of the dog (Excalibur) without prior mention or setup  
- [CLARITY] The tramp's behavior shifts abruptly from threatening to affable without clear motivation  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the tramp's interaction to the dog's appearance is abrupt and lacks smooth connection
