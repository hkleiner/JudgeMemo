Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "He had appreciated, as it was natural that he should do, all that had been so utterly indifferent to his mother" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)
- [SYNTAX] "The mouth was normal, with neither very thin nor thick lips, the eyes small and the distance between also normal" (run-on sentence with missing conjunction)
- [SPELLING] "tshokh" (unconventional spelling that may be distracting)
- [SYNTAX] "The property is inherited by the wife, who in case she marries again must yield it to the male heirs" (awkward phrasing)
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from descriptive text about the Sarö Yögurs to military operations and then back to cultural practices (disrupts flow)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden transition from romantic narrative to physical description of people (lack of clear connection)
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from cultural practices to military operations with no transitional explanation
- [CLARITY] Confusing sequence of topics (romance, physical description, marriage customs, military operations, birth/death statistics)
- [TRANSITION] No clear connection between the ghost story narrative and the cultural practices description
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent focus between personal narratives and anthropological observations
