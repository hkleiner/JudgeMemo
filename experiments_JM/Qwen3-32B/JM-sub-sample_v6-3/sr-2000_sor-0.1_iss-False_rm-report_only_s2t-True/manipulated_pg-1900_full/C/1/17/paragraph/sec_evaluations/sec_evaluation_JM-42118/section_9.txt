Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he becomes heated--enters a café to eat an ice" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "At five of the clock in the morning of the 22nd day of August 1806" (cumbersome and archaic phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "eat an ice" (uncommon phrasing; should be "eat an ice cream" or similar)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes without clear purpose  
- [SYNTAX] "Fragonard disappeared, neglected and well-nigh discredited for years" (awkward structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's death to a broader discussion of French art and history without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph introduces new themes (art history, French Revolution) that are not clearly connected to the preceding narrative  
- [CLARITY] "The art of Fragonard embodies astoundingly the pulsing evening of a century of the life of France" (confusing and abstract phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the personal narrative of Fragonard to a historical and artistic analysis  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Queen Victoria and Marguerite Gérard feels disconnected from the main narrative about Fragonard  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
