- [GRAMMAR] "The red mantles and togas in which the lamas sometimes drape themselves wearing their right arm and shoulder bare..." (run-on sentence and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Shera Yögurs inhabit the mountains round the following rivers, all of which are tributaries of Hei-ho or of its tributaries..." (redundant phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the lamas and the author's departure to a detailed description of the landscape and journey (lack of smooth transition)  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Boucher in Italy appears unrelated to the rest of the text and disrupts the flow of the narrative  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of terms like "t'umu," "fu-fumu's," and "t'idu" is unclear without prior context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of the t'umu's residence to the governance structure of the Shera Yögurs  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Boucher is out of place and does not logically follow the previous content  
- [CLARITY] The monetary units and terms like "lan," "taels," and "tiao" are not clearly explained  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptions of the landscape, the author's journey, and administrative details without clear organization  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the Dungan revolt and horse levies is introduced without sufficient context or explanation  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "ta t'umu" and the hierarchy of t'umus is not clearly explained  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the t'umu's house to the geographical description of the Shera Yögurs is abrupt
