Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He found himself trying to hide it because he knew she could read minds. Just how do you hide your thoughts from a mind reader?" (Awkward phrasing and incomplete thought)  
- [SYNTAX] "He found himself liking Margot Dennison too much. He found himself trying to hide it because he knew she could read minds." (Repetition and awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He grabbed Margot and pulled her close to him, seeking her lips with his, letting his thoughts wander into a fantasy of desire." (Slightly awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "X marks the spot, thought Ramsey. XXX marks the spot-spot-spot." (Unconventional punctuation and phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey had come to a conclusion: he did not like letting Margot know how he felt about her, but it was mostly on a straight physical level..." (Awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He found himself liking Margot Dennison too much. He found himself trying to hide it because he knew she could read minds." (Sudden shift in focus without clear transition)  
- [CLARITY] "He designated it as X." (Reference to "it" is unclear without prior context)  
- [TRANSITION] "X marks the spot, thought Ramsey. XXX marks the spot-spot-spot. X is a spot in a pot or a lot of rot...." (Abrupt and confusing shift in tone and logic)  
- [LOGIC] "Ramsey had come to a conclusion: he did not like letting Margot know how he felt about her, but it was mostly on a straight physical level..." (Confusing reasoning and unclear connection to the rest of the narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from Ramsey's personal thoughts to the introduction of the security officer and his conversation with Garr Symm is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.
