Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "phnix-wise" (misspelled "phoenix-wise")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the riding-horse and pack-horse had hardly given place to the coach and waggon before the railway superseded road traffic" (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [LEXICON] "the white feather" (idiomatic reference without sufficient context for clarity)  
- [SYNTAX] "They were, as a class, highly cultivated men, who had travelled much on the Continent, and mixed in society there" (awkward structure and missing verb)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "and in being born, whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which she sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities that place her amongst the most fascinating peoples of the ages" (overuse of commas and complex structure hinders readability)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from political and social history to a discussion of Admiral Keppel's portrait and Boucher's art (disconnected from the main theme)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Admiral Keppel and Boucher is isolated and does not contribute to the overall argument or narrative  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the discussion of the aristocracy to the loss of America and the French Revolution (lack of smooth connection)  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the white feather" is unclear without further explanation  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the working class at the end is introduced abruptly and lacks a clear connection to the preceding content  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
