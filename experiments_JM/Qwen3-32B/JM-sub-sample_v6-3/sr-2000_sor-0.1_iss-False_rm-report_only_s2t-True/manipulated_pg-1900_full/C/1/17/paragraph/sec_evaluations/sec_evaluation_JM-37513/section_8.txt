Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the light of men is Justice. Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny."
- [LEXICON] Sudden shift to poetic language ("The ocean of divine wisdom surgeth within this exalted word") that contrasts with the scientific tone.
- [SPELLING] "surgeth" is archaic and may be considered non-standard spelling.
- [SYNTAX] Confusing sentence structure in "We do not pretend to say why facts are what they are and as they are."
- [SYNTAX] Ambiguous phrasing in "If we are speaking of the cognitive relation, which is an awareness relation, the question seems to be whether a relation of awareness is related to itself."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from scientific discussion to poetic/religious language without clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical discussion to a letter from Tushratta with no clear connection to the previous content.
- [LOGIC] Disjointed return to scientific discussion after the letter, with no clear explanation of how these elements relate.
- [CLARITY] Confusing use of terms like "cognitive process" and "physiological process" without clear definitions or consistent usage.
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the letter from Tushratta and the subsequent scientific discussion.
