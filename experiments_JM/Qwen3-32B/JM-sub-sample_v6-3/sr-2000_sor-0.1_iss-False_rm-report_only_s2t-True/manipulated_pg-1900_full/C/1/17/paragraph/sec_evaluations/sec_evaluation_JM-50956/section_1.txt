Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia at present lies in seas of blood and tears because of her enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Prussian militarism." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The charming novelettes in which the allegory is forgotten need no more justification than the adventures in The Faerie Queene, or the parliamentary debates in Paradise Lost." (confusing comparison)  
- [LEXICON] "The Idylls fall into line with two of the greatest poems in the English language..." (unclear reference to "The Idylls")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia's losses are more than twice those of France, four-five times those of England..." (missing hyphen in "four-five")  
- [GRAMMAR] "three-four times all the forces mustered by the United States" (missing hyphen in "three-four")  
- [GRAMMAR] "About one-half of the besieged army would be used to charge the Union line in the vicinity of Fort Stedman." (awkward phrasing, unclear context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "To this it must be added that Russia entered the War unprepared for a modern struggle." (awkward transition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Russian Army consisted of millions, but bayonets and guns it had only for one-tenth of its number." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the fall of 1917 the Russian Armies collapsed after months of intensive German and Bolshevist propaganda..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "This weakening of the powers of the enemy by Russia was already bound at various stages of the War to facilitate correspondingly the various operations of the Allies." (awkward and overly complex sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Russia's role in WWI to a detailed description of a Civil War battle at Fort Stedman (irrelevant to the main topic)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing Russia's role in WWI and unrelated literary references (e.g., "The Idylls," "The Faerie Queene")  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Idylls" is unclear without context  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the Civil War battle at Fort Stedman is out of place and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the chapter "Russia's Part in the World War - Was it Possible for Germany to Win the War?" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The text discusses Russia's role in WWI but then shifts to a general question about whether Germany could have won the war without sufficient explanation or context  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the old Field Marshal, Moltke" is vague without prior context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
