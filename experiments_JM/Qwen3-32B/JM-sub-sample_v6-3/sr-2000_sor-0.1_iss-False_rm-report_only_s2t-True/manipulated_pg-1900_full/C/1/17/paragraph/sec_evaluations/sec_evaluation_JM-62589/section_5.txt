Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he is dying! Leave us alone, he comes from my town, I have something to say to him." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Tell her that her father died—like—a—soldier." (overuse of em dashes disrupts flow)  
- [SYNTAX] "The Bradlaugh case was the last attempt to repeat the tactics by which Wilkes was kept out of Parliament;" (complex sentence structure is confusing)  
- [SPELLING] "o’er" (archaic spelling may be intentional but is inconsistent with modern style)  
- [LEXICON] "dish the Whigs" (ambiguous phrasing; unclear meaning without context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the action scene to a historical analysis of English governance (disjointed transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The historical section is unrelated to the narrative and disrupts the flow of the story  
- [CLARITY] The historical analysis is dense and lacks clear connection to the main plot  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the fight scene and the historical commentary  
- [LOGIC] The return to the narrative after the historical section is abrupt and lacks context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
