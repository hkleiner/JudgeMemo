2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Mrs. Corvick’s emotional response to the publication of her novel to the arrival of Drayton Deane and the news of Vereker’s illness, with little transitional clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The passage jumps between different timelines and events (e.g., the publication of "Overmastered," the arrival of "The Right of Way," and Vereker’s death) without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of "the figure in the carpet" is used repeatedly but is not clearly explained or resolved, leading to confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the emotional climax of Mrs. Corvick’s refusal to the discussion of the book reviews and Deane’s arrival is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift from the narrator’s internal monologue to the external events (e.g., the arrival of Deane and the news of Vereker’s illness) is jarring and lacks logical flow.
