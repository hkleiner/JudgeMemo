Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We give HO as the formula for a molecule of water."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous use of "radical and important distinction" without clear context.  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "We give HO as the formula..." (should be "the formula").  
- [SPELLING] "evolutional" is an uncommon and awkward phrasing; "evolutionary" is more standard.  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "And if this be so, then they ought somehow to be introduced into our formulae, instead of being taken for granted."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from scientific discussion to a biographical anecdote about a painter ("A year later, when the President sent some dozen pictures to the R.A., his activity came to a sudden end...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition from the painter's story back to the discussion of "the doctrine of implication" and "laws of B and C."  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between the painter's life and the preceding and following scientific content.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt return to the scientific discussion after the painter's story without clear linkage.  
- [LOGIC] The final quote from Spencer is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the reader without a complete idea.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
