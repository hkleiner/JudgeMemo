Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He took from everybody, but he was always judicious, because, quite apart from his executive faculties, he had a critical gift of the first order." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [SPELLING] "unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter..." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [SYNTAX] "The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna, and the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of Europe, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with their hard drinking and lusty bawling..." (somewhat archaic or imprecise word choice)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Reynolds to Millet without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different artists and time periods without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] The connection between Reynolds and Millet is not clearly established  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing the "Angelus" to the broader philosophical implications of the painting  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's holiday." is out of place and unrelated to the rest of the text
