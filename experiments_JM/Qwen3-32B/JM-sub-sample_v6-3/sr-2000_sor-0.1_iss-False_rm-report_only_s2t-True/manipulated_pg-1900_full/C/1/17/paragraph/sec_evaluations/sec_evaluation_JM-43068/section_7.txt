Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "breathe his last on the 20th of January 1875" (should be "breathed his last")  
- [SPELLING] "betrays the same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises many a drawing" (should be "characterizes")  
- [SYNTAX] "The major result of the opening 4 days of combat, however, was the failure of the Federal forces to break the Confederate defense line." (sudden shift in subject and tone, inconsistent with the rest of the text)  
- [LEXICON] "He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside his friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well." (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The mind and character of the man can be read in every line and in every touch of the brush." (repetition of "in")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Millet's death to a military statement about the "Federal forces" and "Confederate defense line" with no contextual connection  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the chapter on Millet to a military analysis without any logical or thematic link  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Federal forces" and "Confederate defense line" is confusing and irrelevant to the preceding and following content about Millet  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the section on Millet's death and the unrelated military statement  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
