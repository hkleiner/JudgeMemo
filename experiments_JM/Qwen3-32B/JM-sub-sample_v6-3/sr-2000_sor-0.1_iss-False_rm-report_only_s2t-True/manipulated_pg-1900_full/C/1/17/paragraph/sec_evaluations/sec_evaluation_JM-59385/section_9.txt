Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have listened with Chia Kuei Ping to the chant of services in the Llama temple" – awkward phrasing and missing article ("the Llama temple" should be "a Llama temple" or "the Lama temple").  
- [SPELLING] "Llama temple" – likely a misspelling of "Lama temple."  
- [SYNTAX] "to make which men carried pure white marble all the way from India that they might have a fitting dwelling place for their gods" – complex and confusing sentence structure.  
- [LEXICON] "t'umu" – unclear if this is a proper noun or a term that should be defined for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "There are no written laws, neither are any of the people able to read" – awkward phrasing and redundancy.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from religious temples to the role of a "t'umu" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the "t'umu" and the final paragraph about parents and Chia Kuei Ping feel disconnected from the earlier narrative about temples and worship.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "t'umu" is unclear without context or definition, which disrupts the reader's understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing religious practices to the legal and social system is not smoothly executed.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about parents coveting the light in Chia Kuei Ping’s eyes is somewhat vague and lacks a clear link to the preceding content.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
