Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It's humiliating!" (fragmented sentence, lacks context for standalone clarity)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had hardly, however, gone a couple of miles..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis," gasped out the boy... (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis," gasped out the boy, "but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost." (missing comma after introductory dialogue tag)  
- [SPELLING] "Excalibur, rising from the hearthrug..." (no spelling errors, but awkward transition)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from dialogue to Excalibur's actions without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of Excalibur's role as a chaperon without prior setup  
- [CLARITY] "It's humiliating!" lacks context for the reader to understand the emotional weight  
- [TRANSITION] Jump from the dinner scene to the tennis and golf games with no clear narrative thread  
- [LOGIC] The curate and Eileen's conversation about finances appears disconnected from the earlier narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
