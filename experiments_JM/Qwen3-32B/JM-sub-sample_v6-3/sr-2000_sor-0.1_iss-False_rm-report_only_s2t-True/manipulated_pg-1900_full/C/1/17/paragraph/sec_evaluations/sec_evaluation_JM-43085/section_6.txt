1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The lamas scarlet mantles, highcombed head dresses, staffs and other insignia were lying." (missing prepositions and punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "highcombed" should be "high-combed"  
- [SYNTAX] "He owned some beautiful ones, and used them not only as models but also for riding." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The fourth side, that towards the entrance door, was open allowing free passage for light but also for cold." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The lamas scarlet mantles, highcombed head dresses, staffs and other insignia were lying." (missing commas and prepositions)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Meissonier's studio and artistic process to a description of a Buddhist temple and its interior.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Buddhist temple and its contents is disconnected from the rest of the text about Meissonier.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the Buddhist temple is detailed but lacks a clear purpose or connection to the main narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the section on Meissonier and the unrelated description of the Buddhist temple.
