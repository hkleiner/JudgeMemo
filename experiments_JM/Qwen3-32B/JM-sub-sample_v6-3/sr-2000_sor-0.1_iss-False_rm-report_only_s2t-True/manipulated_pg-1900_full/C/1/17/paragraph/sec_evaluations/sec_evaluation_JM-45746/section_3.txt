Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The words which I have noted and phonetically transcribed as heard among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs, are to be found in a table at the end of this brochure." (awkward phrasing and subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [SPELLING] "coöperation" (non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "The latter plan was unfortunately followed by a superintendent of my acquaintance." (awkward word order)  
- [LEXICON] "He talked about everything in the educational catalog that had nothing to do with the opening weeks of school..." (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The teaching of the English classics has been somewhat varied in plan and the results accomplished have not always been satisfactory."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing teacher meetings to a section on "words among the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs" with no clear connection to the broader narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on the Sarö Yögurs and Shera Yögurs is inserted without explanation and disrupts the flow of the chapter on teacher meetings.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Bahá'u'lláh's warning" in the middle of the school board chapter is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the English teachers' meetings to the school board chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [LOGIC] The numbered list under "2. Number of boys and number of girls..." appears out of context and is not clearly connected to the surrounding text.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
