Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "It is a terribly ambiguous way of expressing the fact."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, e.g., "But did Spencer fully realize how big a hole this knocks in the bottom of the purely mechanical interpretation..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and technical terms without clear definition, e.g., "noumenon," "cognitive relatedness."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation in long sentences, e.g., missing commas in "Still, certain specific characteristics of living organisms are explicitly recognized as among the accessible phenomena; and these cannot be conceived in physico-chemical terms."  
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly convoluted, e.g., "It is so terribly complex that it is difficult to deal with it comprehensibly in a brief space."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are not clearly connected to the main thesis, e.g., the discussion of "subjective affections" and "vivid/faint" states of consciousness.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between philosophical concepts and scientific terminology without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of key terms like "cognitive relatedness" and "subjective affections" is not consistently clarified.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin without clear reference to the previous one, e.g., the shift from Spencer's philosophy to the discussion of physiological processes.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about vitalism is introduced without sufficient groundwork from earlier sections.
