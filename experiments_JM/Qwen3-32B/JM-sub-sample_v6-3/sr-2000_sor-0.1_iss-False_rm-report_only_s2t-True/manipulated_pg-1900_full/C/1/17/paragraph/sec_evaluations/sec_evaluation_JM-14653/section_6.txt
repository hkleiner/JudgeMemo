- [SPELLING] "deficiences" (incorrect spelling, should be "deficiencies")
- [SYNTAX] "the soul's unconditioned surrender of its will to the transformative influence they mediate" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "the reader who has found even one good answer to the above question, need read no more..." (subject-verb agreement issue)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing goodwill to a detailed description of a temple and expedition without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from philosophical discussion of Christmas and friendship to a narrative about a temple and expedition
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the temple and expedition feels disconnected from the preceding philosophical content
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the Christmas/friendship section and the temple/ruin description
- [LOGIC] The text moves from discussing spiritual educators to Christmas celebrations to a seemingly unrelated travel narrative without logical connection
