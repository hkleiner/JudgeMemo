Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Viewed in the light of their second station ... they manifest absolute servitude..." (sentence is cut off mid-phrase, creating confusion)  
- [SPELLING] "vehiclo" (misspelled; should be "vehicle")  
- [SYNTAX] "The size of the residence and the quality of its furnishings depends..." (subject-verb agreement error; "depends" should be "depend")  
- [LEXICON] "cocoanut" (archaic or non-standard spelling; should be "coconut")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is on that one of these posts most nearly opposite the door that the mirror always finds its place." (awkward phrasing and word order)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from describing the lifestyle of Filipinos in quiet hamlets to the interior design of Filipino homes, with little transitional connection.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the rich Filipino's household is followed by a disconnected quote ("Even as He saith: 'I am the servant of God...') that lacks context and relevance.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Viewed in the light of their second station..." is vague and lacks explanation, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the tao's eating habits to the mention of the middle class is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the leper colony begins with an abstract philosophical statement ("The problem is, of course, twofold...") that is unrelated to the narrative and disrupts the flow.
