Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted, and the souls have been quickened in the tombs of their bodies." (archaic phrasing may be intentional but is inconsistent with surrounding modern English)  
- [SPELLING] "marvellous" (British spelling used in a text otherwise using American English)  
- [SYNTAX] "the primeval saga-note of heroic savagery" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the organ-music of its Miltons and Wordsworths" (metaphor is unclear and confusing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted, and the souls have been quickened in the tombs of their bodies." (awkward comma placement)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the spiritual significance of religious texts to a narrative about "Adolphe" and "Madame Bauche" without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from a philosophical discussion of religion to a narrative fragment, disrupting the flow  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor "the organ-music of its Miltons and Wordsworths" is unclear and does not logically connect to the surrounding ideas  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of spiritual development to the narrative about "Adolphe" is jarring and lacks explanation  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text oscillates between abstract philosophical discourse and narrative fragments, creating inconsistency in tone and purpose  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
