Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact that it was still his mission, the mission of a Chosen People." (awkward phrasing and incorrect use of "away with")  
- [SYNTAX] "If I go," Robertâ€™s voice rang clear, "you will have to carry me dead." (awkward placement of dialogue tag)  
- [SPELLING] "Shirtliffe" is inconsistently spelled as "Shirtliffe" and "Shirtliffe" (no issue, but the name is repeated with slight inconsistency in formatting)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Beat the drum bravely, Molly my boy! See the sun is tinting the far east." (missing comma after "Molly")  
- [LEXICON] "The old fox has caught even you napping" (colloquial phrasing that may be confusing in a historical narrative)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the drummer's sacrifice to a philosophical statement about Israel's mission ("No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact...") that is unrelated to the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly transitions from the battle scene to a philosophical or religious reflection, disrupting the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The line "No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact that it was still his mission, the mission of a Chosen People." is unclear and does not logically connect to the preceding or following content.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Robert's escape to the philosophical statement is jarring and lacks a clear connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
