Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was quite impossible, too, short of locking him up, to prevent him from accompanying us when we took our walks abroad, if he had made up his mind to do so." (awkward phrasing and comma placement)  
- [SYNTAX] "He responded by collapsing like a camp bedstead, and I left him." (sudden shift in tone and unclear connection)  
- [LEXICON] "He was the picture of misery." (colloquial phrasing that may confuse some readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He started systematically with the rose beds, but met with no success." (missing clarity in the connection between clauses)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He spoke as if he would conciliate the ghastly shades that moved restlessly up and down, when suddenly--" (sudden shift in narrative voice and incomplete sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil...." (abrupt transition and unclear connection to the preceding narrative)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from the minds and the understanding of men." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the bone-burying incident to the dinner party and Lady Wickham is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [STRUCTURE] The story shifts from Excalibur's behavior to a philosophical statement about moderation and hidden things, which feels disconnected from the main narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The line "He spoke as if he would conciliate the ghastly shades that moved restlessly up and down" is unclear and disrupts the flow of the story.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dinner party to the final discovery of the bone is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the cushion and the bone feels like an abrupt ending that lacks a clear connection to the previous events.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
