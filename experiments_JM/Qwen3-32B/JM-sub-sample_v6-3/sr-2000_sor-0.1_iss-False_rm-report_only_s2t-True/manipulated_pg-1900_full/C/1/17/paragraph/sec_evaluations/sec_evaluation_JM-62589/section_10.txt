- [SPELLING] "Shirtliffe" is inconsistently capitalized in some instances.  
- [LEXICON] "The Carlsbad Basketmakers, for defense or economic reasons, probably joined..." is a sudden shift in tone and subject.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Tell—her—I—died—like—a—soldier,—like father!" uses excessive dashes, disrupting flow.
