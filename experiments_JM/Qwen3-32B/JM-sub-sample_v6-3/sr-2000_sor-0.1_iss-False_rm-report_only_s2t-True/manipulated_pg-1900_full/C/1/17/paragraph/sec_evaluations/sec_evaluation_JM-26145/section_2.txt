Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Almighty beareth Me witness: To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of man." (archaic verb form "beareth" is inconsistent with the rest of the text's modern tone)  
- [SPELLING] "Bedawìn" (inconsistent diacritic usage; should be "Bedawin" or "Bedouin")  
- [SPELLING] "bakshìsh" (inconsistent diacritic usage; should be "baksheesh" or "baksheesh")  
- [SYNTAX] "The ordinary tribute was fixed, as well as the regular subsidy for royal troops and the force which had to be raised in emergencies." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The Almighty beareth Me witness..." (sudden shift in tone and register, inconsistent with the rest of the text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from religious reform to the "Almighty beareth Me witness" passage without clear connection to the preceding context  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from the religious reforms of Akhenaten to the administrative and military challenges in the Asiatic provinces, with no clear transitional link  
- [CLARITY] The passage about the "Almighty beareth Me witness" is stylistically and thematically disconnected from the surrounding content, making it unclear whether it is a direct quote, a hymn, or a commentary  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the Egyptian government's response to the vassal states lacks a clear connection to the earlier discussion of religious reform and the new capital at Amarna  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
