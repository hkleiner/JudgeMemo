Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The alcaldes who presided over the civil affairs of the municipality from the first reorganization in 1820 had usually been chosen from among the Mexican people living there..."  
- [SPELLING] "premised" should be "predisposed" or "persuaded" in "they readily premised peace..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the Republic" (first mention should be "the Republic")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "With the coming of Sam Houston to Nacogdoches in 1833, followed by such men as General Thomas J. Rusk in 1835..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "After the disorganization of the West and South, which were devastated by the advance of the enemy."

- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the political development of Nacogdoches to the Cordova Rebellion without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of names and roles in "Commercial Expansion" chapter disrupts narrative flow

- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference in "What could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance...?" lacks context for clarity  
- [LOGIC] Sudden mention of "the Fredonian rebellion" in "Commercial Expansion" chapter lacks prior explanation
