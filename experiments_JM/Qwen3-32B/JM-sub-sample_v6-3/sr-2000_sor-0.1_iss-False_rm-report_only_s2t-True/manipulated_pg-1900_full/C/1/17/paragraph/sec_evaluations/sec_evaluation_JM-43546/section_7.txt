Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Our little party were shown" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In one of the ruined aisles of the church which stands in one corner..." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [SPELLING] "tewky" (likely a misspelling or informal term without context)  
- [SYNTAX] "There would be no use in staying indoors, for this is the way it is most of the time." (redundant phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "cheep" (uncommon word usage without clear context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the visit to Abbotsford to the Gordon family's journey to Skylemore without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly moves from the children's visit to the description of their journey and the birthday party, creating a disjointed flow  
- [CLARITY] The term "tewky" is unclear and not explained, potentially confusing the reader  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the visit to Dryburgh Abbey to the description of the train journey and the Highlands is abrupt and lacks smooth connection  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
