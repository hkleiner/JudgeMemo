2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and subject at the end when describing facial features of "they" (likely a misplaced paragraph or section)  
- [LOGIC] The description of facial features seems unrelated to the narrative and appears to be an inserted passage from a different context  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about facial features disrupts the flow of the narrative and is confusing in context  
- [CLARITY] The transition from the rescue scene to the facial description is abrupt and lacks explanation  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about facial features is not connected to the characters or the plot, making it seem out of place  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
