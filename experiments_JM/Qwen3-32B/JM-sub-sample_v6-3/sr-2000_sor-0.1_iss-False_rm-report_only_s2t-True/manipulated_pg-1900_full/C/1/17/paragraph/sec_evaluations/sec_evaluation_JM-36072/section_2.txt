Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We however who have witnessed the succession of economic crises..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Misplaced modifier in "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories."  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" is an archaic or non-standard spelling; "wagon-loads" is more common.  
- [LEXICON] "vulgar language" is used in a context that may confuse the reader due to its colloquial tone.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes and lack of clarity in sentence structure in "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing historical conditions of the poor to a dialogue ("My own darling, thank God you are found...") that seems unrelated.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the discussion of historical social conditions to modern global unification and migration.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the BÃ¡b declared His mission" is unclear without context, making the passage confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the discussion of 19th-century England and the modern global effects of unification.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on Plato and industrial Athens is inserted without clear connection to the preceding or following content.
