Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "27) he included in his little list of ladies impossible for a royal harem" – missing subject and awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "Evidently he meant to enumerate superciliously petty foreign 'princesses' only." – awkward and unclear syntax.  
- [LEXICON] "Happily all that is best in Christendom recognizes, with Kuenen or Matthew Arnold, the grandeur of the Old Testament ideal." – overly archaic or unclear phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "hypothecating a first man who, somehow, had developed independently of the beasts of the field although he seemed to fit their evolutionary pattern." – awkward phrasing and unclear logic.  
- [SYNTAX] "The entire country is dotted with large 'midden circles.'" – abrupt transition and unclear connection to the preceding narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] "Documentary evidence in regard to their origin had existed, and had been left in the care of Li-yen's military mandarin..." – overly complex and convoluted sentence structure.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the letter to a description of "midden circles" and historical documents – no clear narrative connection.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the letter to the "midden circles" section – no logical or contextual link.  
- [CLARITY] The letter's content is dense and philosophical, but its relevance to the main narrative is unclear.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from a letter to a historical account with no clear transition or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "midden circles" and historical documents feels disconnected from the main plot involving Ramsey and Margot.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
