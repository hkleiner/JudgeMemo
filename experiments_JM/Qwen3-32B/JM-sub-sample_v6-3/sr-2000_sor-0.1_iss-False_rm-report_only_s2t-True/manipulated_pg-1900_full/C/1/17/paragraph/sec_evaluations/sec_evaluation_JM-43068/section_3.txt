Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The innovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI." is a sentence fragment.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Instead it made them savages and I have had to watch their slow climb back to the stars. An equation, Ramsey. Almost an equation of doom. Now go." is a jarring and grammatically disjointed passage with no clear connection to the surrounding text.  
- [SPELLING] "m√©nage" is spelled correctly but may be unfamiliar to some readers.  
- [SYNTAX] "He was of a contemplative disposition, and had a keenly developed feeling for natural beauty." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SYNTAX] "The very trees themselves dwarfed and gnarled; in their struggle with the elements they have been made tough and hardy as the inhabitants of the country themselves, and, stunted as they are, yet show well that they can resist the force of the fiercest storm." is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [SYNTAX] "The good man seems to have been taken with the child; he found him so attentive to all natural phenomenon which was passing around him and intelligent in an unusual degree." has a subject-verb agreement error ("phenomenon" should be "phenomena").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift to "Instead it made them savages and I have had to watch their slow climb back to the stars. An equation, Ramsey. Almost an equation of doom. Now go." is completely disconnected from the surrounding narrative and lacks any logical or contextual connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the description of Millet's early life to the disconnected passage about "Ramsey" and "equation of doom" is abrupt and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about "Ramsey" and "equation of doom" is unclear and does not contribute to the narrative about Millet.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the detailed description of Millet's upbringing to the unrelated and jarring passage is jarring and disrupts the flow of the text.
