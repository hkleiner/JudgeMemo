Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Beneath the entrance have been found skeletons..." is awkwardly phrased and should be "Beneath the entrance, skeletons of many small animals have been found..."  
- [SYNTAX] "The reproduction which we give in the present volume was made from this smaller copy." is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [LEXICON] "She exhibited a scrupulousness that well illustrates her honesty and disinterestedness." is somewhat wordy and could be simplified.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, such as "When the moment for delivery arrived, the American claimed that he was entitled to a share of the profits resulting from the exhibition of the work."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Beneath the entrance have been found skeletons of many small animals that died either from the fall or starvation." appears out of context and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the story of the Horse Fair to the mention of skeletons is abrupt and confusing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the skeletons is isolated and not clearly connected to the rest of the text.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
