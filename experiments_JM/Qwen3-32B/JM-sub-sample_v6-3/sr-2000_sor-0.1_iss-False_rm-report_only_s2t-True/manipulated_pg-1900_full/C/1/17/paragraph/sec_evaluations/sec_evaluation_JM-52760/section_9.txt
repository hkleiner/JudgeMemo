Col. Horace Porter" - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The story of the fighting along the Petersburg front on that spring Sunday is one of Union success over stout Confederate resistance." - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The desperateness of the Southern position was shown when, about 10 a.m., Lee telegraphed President Davis to inform him of the turn of events at Petersburg." - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The outcome of the struggle was determined by the numbers in the attacking force, but the capture of Fort Gregg occurred only after bitter hand-to-hand combat."
