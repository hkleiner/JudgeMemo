- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a deeply emotional prayer to a description of Davy’s sickness and Mrs. Buck’s visits.

- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about games and gambling is out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the reawakened interest in religion is abstract and does not clearly connect to the characters or plot.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Lyddy’s emotional prayer to the chapter heading and then to Davy’s sickness lacks a smooth transition.
