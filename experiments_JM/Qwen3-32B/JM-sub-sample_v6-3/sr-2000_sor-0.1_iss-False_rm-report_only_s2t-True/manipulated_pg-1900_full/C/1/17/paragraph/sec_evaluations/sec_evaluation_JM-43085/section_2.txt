Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He, also, speaketh the truth..." is archaic and inconsistent in tense with the rest of the text.  
- [SPELLING] "aquarelle" is misspelled (should be "aquarelle" or "watercolor").  
- [SYNTAX] "Be one's tastes never so modest..." is an archaic construction that disrupts modern fluency.  
- [LEXICON] "slender artistic fame" is vague and awkward phrasing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "It is impossible to imagine how different the history of the past century and a half would have been..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Meissonier's early career to a philosophical and religious discussion about Bah치'u'll치h and humanity's unity is jarring and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Meissonier's artistic development and abstract philosophical reflections without transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The section on Bah치'u'll치h is unclear in its relevance to the narrative about Meissonier.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Meissonier's financial struggles to the "Unlooked-for windfall" is abrupt and lacks logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The Indian Cabin" and the detailed description of illustrations is disconnected from the earlier narrative about Meissonier's early struggles.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
