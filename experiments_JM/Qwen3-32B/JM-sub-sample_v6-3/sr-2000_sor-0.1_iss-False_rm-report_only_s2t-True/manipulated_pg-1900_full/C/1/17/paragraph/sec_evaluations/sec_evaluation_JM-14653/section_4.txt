Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He who girds at an ancient established festival should reflect upon sundry obvious truths before he withers up the said festival by the sirocco of his contempt."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the sirocco of his contempt" (should be "the sirocco of his contempt").  
- [SPELLING] "Reynolds claimed a very large circle of intimates, and it was hardly an age of introspection." (awkward phrasing and unclear connection).  
- [SYNTAX] "The next eight years were uneventful, save for the fact that the President was doing some of his best work and enjoying life in the fullest and most complete fashion imaginable." (redundant and wordy).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He who girds at an ancient established festival..." (archaic phrasing may be stylistic but is grammatically awkward for modern readers).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Christmas feasting to a historical anecdote about the President and Reynolds, with no clear connection to the main topic.  
- [STRUCTURE] The anecdote about the President and Reynolds is inserted without clear transition or relevance to the surrounding discussion of Christmas traditions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the President" and "Reynolds" is vague and lacks context, making it difficult to understand their relevance.  
- [TRANSITION] The text transitions abruptly from discussing the spiritual advantages of feasting to a historical anecdote, then back to general reflections on festivals, without clear signposting.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the President and Reynolds is not resolved or connected to the broader argument about Christmas revitalization.
