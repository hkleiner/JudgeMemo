- [GRAMMAR] "Cousin Margaret laughed" (sudden shift in narrative voice and character)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But she had to own up that the rooms looked..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from Jim and Ches's campfire scene to a completely different scene involving "Cousin Margaret" and "rooms"  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Cousin Margaret" and the "rooms" appears disconnected from the main narrative and lacks a clear transition  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "phthisis pulmonalis" is obscure and may confuse readers  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Tushratta" and the quoted grief passage is out of context and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the rattlesnake incident to the "Cousin Margaret" scene is jarring and lacks coherence
