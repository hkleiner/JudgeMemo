Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "it does not matter what--a piece of string, a crumpled chiffon" has awkward phrasing and unclear syntax
- [SYNTAX] "He is to be seen wandering about the Louvre dressed in a cloak or overcoat of a mixed grey cloth, without hooks or eyes or buttons--a cloak which the old man, when he is at work, ties at the waist with it does not matter what--a piece of string, a crumpled chiffon" has complex, run-on sentence structure
- [LEXICON] "The gods of elegance were dead; a severe and frigid morality stood upon their altars" uses metaphorical language that may be confusing to some readers
- [PUNCTUATION] "He returned to Paris a poor old man." lacks a comma after "Paris" for clarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Fragonard's return to Paris to philosophical statements about "The Divine impulses" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics (Fragonard's personal life, political events, artistic developments) without clear transitions
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about "The move was for Fragonard but the prelude to a longer journey" is disconnected from the preceding content
- [CLARITY] The text references historical events and figures without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with French revolutionary history

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
