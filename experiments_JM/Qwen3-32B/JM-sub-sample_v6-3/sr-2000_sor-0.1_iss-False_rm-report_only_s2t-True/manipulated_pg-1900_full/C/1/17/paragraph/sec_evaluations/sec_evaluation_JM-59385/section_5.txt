Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein shadows throw their length across the tidy courtyard" and "Wherein there is deepening sorrow" (fragmented and poetic style may be intentional but disrupts standard fluency)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the fragmented lines "Wherein shadows throw their length across the tidy courtyard" and "Wherein there is deepening sorrow"
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are archaic or culturally specific (e.g., "chair-bearer," "soothsayer," "Imperial Calendar") which may be stylistic but could be confusing to some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from the family's early happiness to the father's illness and the family's growing separation, with little transitional explanation
- [LOGIC] The connection between Fuh Tang's opium use and the deterioration of his relationship with Kuei Ping is implied but not clearly explained
- [CLARITY] The cultural and religious practices (e.g., burial rites, use of charms) are mentioned but not fully explained, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the context
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family's early life to the illness and subsequent tragedy is abrupt and lacks smooth narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
