Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The marriages are arranged by the parents of both parties" is grammatically correct but stylistically jarring in a text about design and printing.  
- [SYNTAX] "The only daughter of a family does not marry" is awkward and unclear in syntax.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [LEXICON] "The marriages are arranged by the parents of both parties" is a sudden shift in subject and tone, inconsistent with the surrounding text.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "A girl cannot get engaged before she is fifteen years old. Men marry between the ages of fifteen and thirty -- women between seventeen and thirty -- and the wives are often eight or ten years older than their husbands." The use of em dashes is inconsistent and disrupts the flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a discussion of design and printing to a detailed description of marriage customs in a tribal society, with no logical connection or transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about marriage customs is structurally disconnected from the rest of the text and appears to be an unrelated insertion.  
- [CLARITY] The sudden shift in subject and tone makes the text confusing and difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] There is no transition or explanation for the shift from design to tribal marriage customs, making the text feel disjointed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
