Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was only too soon apparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not yet ready..." (awkward phrasing and grammatical structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece; and, as commissions were very scarce..." (awkward semicolon usage and sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "he was hard put to gain the means of subsistence" (archaic phrasing that may confuse modern readers)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The loss of America was the first serious blow to the aristocratic régime." (sudden shift in subject and unclear connection to the preceding paragraph)  
- [SPELLING] "régime" (correct spelling, but the word is out of context and disrupts flow)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was during this short visit to his native country that he met his first wife..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He preferred, however, to return to Paris and work out his own destiny as best he might." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The issue was for long in the balance." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Paris, the great centre of art, had yet not afforded him much encouragement." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He resolved to escape from it, and once having put the plan into execution he never returned." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The milk had a good taste and a high percentage of fat." (sudden shift in subject and context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The horses were small, fairly well proportioned, and strong, but not handsome." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The dogs were chiefly Tangutan, large, dark-brown, long-haired, very fine animals." (awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Millet's artistic struggles to a description of sheep, horses, and dogs in the middle of the text (disconnected and confusing)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Millet's life in Paris, his artistic development, and unrelated descriptions of animals and tribes (lack of logical flow)  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the paragraph about the Dungan revolt and the description of the Yögurs (abrupt and confusing)  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the Dungan revolt and the Yögurs is unclear in its relevance to Millet's life and artistic journey (confusing and disjointed)  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the milk, sheep, and horses is unrelated to the main narrative about Millet and disrupts the flow (confusing and out of place)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from Millet's early struggles in Paris to his time in Barbizon, but the transition is abrupt and lacks context (disconnected ideas)
