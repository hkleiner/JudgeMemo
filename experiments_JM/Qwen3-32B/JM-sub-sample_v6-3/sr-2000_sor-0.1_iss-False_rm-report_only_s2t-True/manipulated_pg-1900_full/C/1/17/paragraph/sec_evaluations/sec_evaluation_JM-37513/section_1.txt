Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave." (awkward phrasing and grammatical structure)
- [SYNTAX] "I dimly suspected that the old gentleman--old in the sense of being my father's contemporary--was ignorant..." (dashes used inconsistently with parentheses)
- [SPELLING] "I have no very distinct recollection of the impression produced on my mind by the germinal essay of 1857, save that it served to quicken that craving..." (repetition of "that" creates awkward phrasing)
- [LEXICON] "The war continued." (sudden shift to a more modern, simplified phrasing after more elaborate language)
- [PUNCTUATION] "In any case Tyndall's suggestive sentence was here amplified and the underlying law was disclosed." (missing comma after introductory phrase)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the Civil War peace conference without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Jump between personal narrative and historical events creates disjointed flow
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the Civil War section back to the philosophical discussion without clear connection
- [CLARITY] The text moves between first-person narrative, historical events, and philosophical concepts with inconsistent focus
- [CONTEXT] The Civil War section appears disconnected from the overall discussion of Spencer's philosophy
