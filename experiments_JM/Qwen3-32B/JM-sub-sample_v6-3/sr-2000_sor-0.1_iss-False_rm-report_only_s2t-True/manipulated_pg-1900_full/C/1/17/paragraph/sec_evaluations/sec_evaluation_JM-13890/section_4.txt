Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Emboldened by the breakdown of traditional morality, the advance of the new creed is essentially no more than the triumph of animal impulse..." (awkward phrasing and subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [SYNTAX] "Tendencies once universally castigated as moral failings mutate into necessities of social progress." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Selfishness becomes a prized commercial resource; falsehood reinvents itself as public information..." (word choice is somewhat jarring and inconsistent in tone)  
- [SYNTAX] "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate with the practices of medieval monasticism:" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Such austerity had hitherto been unknown to English saints, and the marvel was increased by the sight--to our notions so revolting--of the innumerable vermin with which the hair-cloth abounded--boiling over with them, as one account describes it, like water in a simmering cauldron." (excessive dashes and complex structure disrupts fluency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He held them in a loving, tender grasp, and for a moment neither spoke." (awkward phrasing and unclear subject reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "Therefore let my brother send gold without measure, in great quantity." (sudden shift in tone and style, inconsistent with surrounding text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the historical narrative of Becket to a philosophical reflection on morality and language is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts from a detailed historical account to a generic religious or moral reflection without clear indication or context.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about "my brother" and the quote is disconnected from the preceding narrative and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical account of Henry II's penance to the description of a romantic scene is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Students of religion are cautioned..." appears out of context and is not clearly related to the preceding or following content.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
