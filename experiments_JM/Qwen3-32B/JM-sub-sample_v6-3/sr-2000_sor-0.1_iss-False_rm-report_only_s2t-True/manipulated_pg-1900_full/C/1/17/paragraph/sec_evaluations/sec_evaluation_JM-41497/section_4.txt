1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He sent another picture of himself to the Uffizzi Gallery in Florence, where so many Masters stand self-committed to canvas in pictures that do not err upon the side of making the sitters lack distinction." (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [SYNTAX] "One may perhaps acknowledge an uneasy feeling that David Garrick himself would make a very small impression upon a latter-day audience, if he confronted it with the mid-eighteenth-century style of speech and action." (awkward structure and unclear reference)  
- [LEXICON] "Few will look in vain to that picture for any of the finest qualities of Sir Joshua's art." (confusing phrasing; "look in vain" is not clearly used)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had very little to learn, though in the summer and autumn of 1781 he visited the Low Countries, staying in Bruges, Brussels, The Hague, Amsterdam, and other cities, and showing himself strangely indifferent to the pictures of Franz Hals, though these might have been presumed to appeal to any portrait painter." (long and complex sentence with unclear flow)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There must be more than this underlying the true story of the affair, for though a visit to Brighton and to Bath restored the President's health, the sittings were not resumed, even when Reynolds wrote to say he was ready to sit again." (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)  
- [SYNTAX] "In '87 the President sent thirteen pictures to the Academy, including the 'Angel's Heads' now in the National Gallery." (inconsistent formatting and unclear reference)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The subject is 'The Infant Hercules' and the canvas hangs in the Hermitage Gallery at St. Petersburg." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "To-day we look at the artist's work with a critical eye--he can no longer thrive by comparison with contemporaries, but must compete with all dead masters of portraiture; and it will be admitted on every side that he holds his own..." (awkward phrasing and unclear transition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground." (sudden shift in tone and unclear reference)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about "playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground" is a sudden and illogical shift in tone and content, with no clear connection to the rest of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different events and ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the furore he had excited" is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to understand its relevance.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed historical account of Reynolds' life and career to the final humorous and disjointed paragraph is abrupt and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "some wretched modern Americans" and "the Rising Sun Lubricator" without explanation, making it unclear how these relate to the subject.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
