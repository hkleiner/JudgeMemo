Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was in the world," the Gospel declares, "and the world was made by him...." (awkward phrasing and incomplete thought)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is, therefore, an inadequate recognition of the unique station of Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus, Muhammad--or of the succession of Avatars who inspired the Hindu scriptures--to depict their work as the founding of distinct religions." (long and complex sentence structure hinders readability)  
- [LEXICON] "He Himself warns that it is not He Who will condemn those who reject the message He bears, but Moses 'in whom ye trust.'" (archaic and inconsistent use of "He" and "ye")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob ... and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) Prophets from their Lord...." (inconsistent punctuation and ellipses usage)  
- [SPELLING] "Isl√°m" (inconsistent spelling with "Islam" elsewhere in the text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from discussing the role of religious figures to the social status of women and then to crime and punishment, with minimal transitional support.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on the Hebrew people and Muhammad is dense and lacks clear progression, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of "Divine intermediaries" is introduced but not clearly explained in the context of the broader argument.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of religion and science to the role of women is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the harshness of punishments in sacred texts is introduced but not fully resolved or connected to the broader theme of moral consciousness.
