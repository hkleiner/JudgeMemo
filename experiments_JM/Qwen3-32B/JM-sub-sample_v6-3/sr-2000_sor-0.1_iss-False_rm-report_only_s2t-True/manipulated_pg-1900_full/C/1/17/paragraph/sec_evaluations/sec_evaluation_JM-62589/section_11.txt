Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had become an object of absorbing concern to him during the last few weeks, and he did not intend to let her slip out of his life without an effort to restrain her." (Awkward phrasing and unclear pronoun reference)  
- [SPELLING] "no every day romance" (should be "no everyday romance")  
- [SYNTAX] "We were consigned for four months to a place foul beyond comparison...." (fragmented sentence, unclear connection to preceding text)  
- [LEXICON] "This is decorated with small pieces of coral and glass beads in various tints of violet." (sudden shift in subject and tone, unclear relevance)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He died on my arm—but he never knew!" (awkward dash usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a historical narrative to a description of a Chinese head-dress with no clear connection or transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly moves from Debby’s emotional resolution to a detailed description of a culturally specific head-dress, breaking the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "We were consigned for four months to a place foul beyond comparison..." is disconnected from the rest of the narrative and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Debby’s story to the head-dress description is jarring and lacks any logical or thematic connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
