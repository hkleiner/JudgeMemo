Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "phnix-wise" (misspelled "phoenix-wise")  
- [GRAMMAR] "For a while only. For just as..." (awkward sentence structure and punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "whilst putting off the vilenesses of the thing from which she sprang, took on also to herself the gracious and winsome qualities..." (cumbersome and confusing phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "Boucher has come into his kingdom again--the most gracious of painters that the years have yielded." (sudden shift in tone and subject, stylistically jarring)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and pillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a carpenter’s line." (overuse of commas, leading to a run-on sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to a narrative about "Boucher" and "Madame Bettina" with no clear connection to the main argument  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from a philosophical and historical discussion to a narrative about a painter and a sewing machine, disrupting the flow  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Boucher" and "Madame Bettina" is unclear and lacks contextual explanation, making it difficult to understand their relevance  
- [TRANSITION] The text moves from a serious discussion of religion and social progress to a seemingly unrelated anecdotal passage without a logical bridge  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
