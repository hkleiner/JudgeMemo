Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The scantiness of documents which we possess regarding his life does not permit us to name the chronological order in which he painted his pictures." (Awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "In every one of his pictures will be found, more or less accentuated, those qualities..." (Passive voice disrupts flow)  
- [SPELLING] "The Family of Darius at the Feet of Alexander after the Battle of Issus, now in the National Gallery at London." (Missing "the" before "National Gallery")  
- [LEXICON] "He cites, as an example of this, that the artist rarely employed ultramarine..." (Wordy and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He also possessed a bank account representing approximately six thousand sequins. But what was that for a man who was the most famous and the most fertile artist of his time?" (Sudden shift in tone and unclear punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It is related that, in order to spare his hosts the necessity of thanking him or the obligation of making some return, he rolled up his canvas..." (Anecdote is presented without clear connection to the main narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] "It is scarcely probable that Veronese could have painted so large a canvas--fourteen metres by seven--in the necessarily brief space of a friendly visit..." (Sudden shift from narrative to speculation disrupts flow)  
- [TRANSITION] "It was a direct descendant of the Venetian Procurator, Count Victor Pisani, who sold the painting to England in 1857." (Abrupt transition to unrelated historical detail)  
- [CLARITY] "Quite probably all of the mentioned Indian groups knew of the entrance to the Carlsbad Caverns." (Sudden and unrelated shift in topic to Native American history)  
- [LOGIC] "However, physical evidence that they did was left by only one groupâ€”the Basketmakers." (Continuation of unrelated topic without clear connection to Veronese or Venice)
