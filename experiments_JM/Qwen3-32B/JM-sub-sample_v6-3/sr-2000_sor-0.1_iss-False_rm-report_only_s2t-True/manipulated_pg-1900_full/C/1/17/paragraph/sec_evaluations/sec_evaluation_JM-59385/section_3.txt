Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in Peking" is a fragment and lacks a main clause.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "Peking" to properly separate the fragment from the following paragraph.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "She heard the tossing of the four cakes which were to bring luck to her family, and the rattle of the sieve placed over her wedding chair to ward off evil spirits as she was sealed into it."  
- [SPELLING] "tiring journey" is likely a typo for "trying journey."  
- [SYNTAX] "It is not always easy to realise what Reynolds' work was like at its best..." is a complex sentence with some awkward phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to discussing Reynolds' artwork interrupts the narrative flow and lacks a clear connection to the rest of the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the wedding ceremony to the discussion of Reynolds is abrupt and jarring.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Reynolds is out of place and disrupts the narrative structure of the story.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of Reynolds is unclear in its purpose and does not contribute to the overall narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The return to the wedding narrative after the Reynolds paragraph is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
