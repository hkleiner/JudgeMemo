Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The work of the teachers was, in short; to 'make the English language the basis of instruction in the public schools.'" (Misuse of semicolon after "in short")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "We landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually employed by the traveling public." (Awkward phrasing and unclear punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "Each of us then straddled the neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to be steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore." (Cumbersome and confusing sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The boat's crew elevated their trousers' legs also and slided down into the water." ("Slided" is nonstandard; should be "slid")  
- [SPELLING] "The boat's crew elevated their trousers' legs also and slided down into the water." (Possessive form "trousers' legs" is awkward and nonstandard)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the emotional scene at the shore to a detailed description of Boucher and his artistic works, with no clear connection to the main narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Boucher and his works is unrelated to the main topic of the teachers in the Philippines, creating a jarring and confusing transition.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the emotional farewell scene to the description of Philippine towns is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the curtain had fallen upon a drama in actual life" is vague and lacks sufficient context to fully understand its significance.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from one unrelated topic to another (e.g., from the emotional farewell to Boucher, then to Philippine towns and education), making the overall structure disjointed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
