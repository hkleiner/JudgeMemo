Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’d call it letters, he’d call it life, but it was all one thing." (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had caught whiffs and hints of he didn’t know what, faint wandering notes of a hidden music." (confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] "bedlamitical" (uncommon and possibly misspelled or misused word)  
- [LEXICON] "He’d call it letters, he’d call it life" (repetition and unclear meaning)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He would bound off on false scents as I had done—he would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown out by the wind of the turned page." (awkward use of em dash)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Corvick and Gwendolen to a historical reference about Napkhuria and Babylonian negotiations (disconnected from the main narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition to "SIX months after our friend had left England..." feels abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the previous section  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of Corvick as a chessplayer and Vereker as an antagonist is complex and may confuse readers  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the narrative about Corvick and Vereker to the unrelated historical quote is jarring and lacks explanation  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
