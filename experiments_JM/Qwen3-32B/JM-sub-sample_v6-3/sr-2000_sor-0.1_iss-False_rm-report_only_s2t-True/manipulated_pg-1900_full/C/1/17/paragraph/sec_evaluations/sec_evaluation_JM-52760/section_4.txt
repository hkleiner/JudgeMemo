Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A sawmill changed a bridge into timber necessary for shoring up the mine." (passive voice and awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Pleasants estimated the tunnel’s direction and depth by means of a theodolite sent him from Washington." (missing "the" before "theodolite")  
- [SYNTAX] "It was about 20 feet from the floor of the tunnel to the enemy works above." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The object was to draw as many of Lee’s soldiers away from Petersburg as possible." (word choice could be clearer)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "TAGI. “Am I not a servant of the king? But my brother is full of wounds..." (sudden shift in tone and unclear punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "TAGI. 'Am I not a servant of the king?'" with no clear connection to the preceding narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly ends with "By 6 a.m. an order had gone out to Brig." without completing the sentence or idea.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "TAGI" and the quoted text is unclear and appears to be an unrelated fragment.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed military planning to the unrelated "TAGI" passage is jarring and disrupts the narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
