Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Sandals of yucca and grasses are found in abundance." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Sandals" (unexpected shift in topic and tone)  
- [SYNTAX] "They ranged from 5 to 11 inches in length, and 2Â½ to 4 inches in width." (awkward transition after unrelated content)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from dialogue to archaeological description without context  
- [LEXICON] "Ply-thicknesses" (uncommon phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from dialogue about Donald's ambitions to unrelated archaeological description of sandals  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed shift from Edinburgh shopping scene to unrelated sandal description and then to a new chapter  
- [CLARITY] No clear connection between the sandal description and the rest of the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transition between the sandal section and the new chapter about Edinburgh and Abbotsford
