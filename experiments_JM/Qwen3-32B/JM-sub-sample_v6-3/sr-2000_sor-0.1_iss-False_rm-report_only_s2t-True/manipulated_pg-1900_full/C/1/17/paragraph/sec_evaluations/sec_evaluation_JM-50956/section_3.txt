Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he had lived in the fullest sense all the time" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SYNTAX] "his visit was quite expected, and was met with a tranquil mind" is redundant and awkward.  
- [LEXICON] "the House in Leicester Square" is unclear without context.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Russian Army, like any other Army, was bound to take the field actively only after the completion of her mobilization" has inconsistent pronoun usage ("her" for "Russian Army").  
- [SYNTAX] "The justice of History--not the 'history' of Ludendorf--will in its own time record how far Russia stood from egotistic politics..." is overly complex and confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Russians, having left only a small force to oppose four Austrian armies, fell with their three armies upon two enemy armies..." is awkward and hard to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Germans saved themselves on that occasion only by destroying the railroads back of them and by burning the bridges" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Ludendorf himself figures these reinforcements which arrived from France in the middle of November, and, consequently, must have left there in the beginning of November, at 225,000 men" is overly wordy and confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "There were 4 corps with 2 infantry divisions, which Ludendorf figures at 225,000 men" is awkward and unclear.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the newly formed 25th Reserve Corps and the 15th Reserve Corps were dispatched to East Prussia" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Germans did not start any offensive in France" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the new sacrifices brought by Russia in October and November on the plains of Galicia, Poland and East Prussia compelled the Germans to desist for more than a year from all attempts to win the War in France" is overly long and complex.  
- [GRAMMAR] "If the Germans were unable in the beginning of the War to win out in France where they had all their forces, allotting to the Russian front only 14 divisions and the Austrian Army, so much the less could they have won at the end of 1914..." is awkward and confusing.  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] The text shifts between discussing historical events and quoting Ludendorf's memoirs without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the battle of Ypres and the Russian operations in 1914 is dense and lacks clear segmentation, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [LOGIC] The text frequently shifts between different time periods and military fronts without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about Russia's role in the war is stated multiple times without building a clear, unified argument.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the justice of History" and "the 'history' of Ludendorf" without clearly explaining the distinction.  
- [LOGIC] The text discusses the German military strategy in the West and East without clearly linking the two.
