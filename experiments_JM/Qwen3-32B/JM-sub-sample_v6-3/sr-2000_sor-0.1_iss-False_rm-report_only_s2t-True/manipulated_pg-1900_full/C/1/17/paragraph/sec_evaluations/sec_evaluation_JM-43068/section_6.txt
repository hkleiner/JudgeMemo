Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The prices which Millet obtained for this series of remarkable works was fantastically small." (Subject-verb agreement error: "prices" should be "was" → "were").  
- [GRAMMAR] "It then passed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secrétan competed up to 160,000 francs..." (Awkward phrasing; "competed up to" is unclear and unidiomatic).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter, one of the most philosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal attraction..." (Awkward structure; "which to-day is" disrupts flow).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter, one of the most virile studies of depraved humanity which the world has ever seen..." (Awkward phrasing; "which" should be "that" for clarity).  
- [SPELLING] "ménage" is spelled correctly but may be unfamiliar to some readers.  
- [LEXICON] "The latter, one of the most philosophical of Millet's pictures..." (Ambiguous use of "latter" without clear antecedent).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in constant fear of the brokers." (Correct, but similar sentences elsewhere lack necessary punctuation).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Millet's personal life to the financial history of "Angelus" without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The dream passage ("One night, in a dream, these exalted words were heard on every side...") is abrupt and thematically disconnected from the surrounding content.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on the Colmar banker's commission is introduced and then dismissed quickly, with no clear connection to the broader narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the latter" in "The latter, one of the most philosophical of Millet's pictures..." is unclear without prior context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Millet's financial struggles to his artistic achievements is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.
