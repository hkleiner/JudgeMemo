Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He has surrendered to the pseudo-classicism of his age, and some of his compositions are absurdly indebted to mythology; but the fault was a virtue then..." (awkward semicolon usage and unclear phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "visayan" (should be capitalized as "Visayan")  
- [SYNTAX] "He has not learned the secrets of permanent colouring, and some of his most brilliant glazes are beginning to fade before the eyes of the troubled owners of the pictures." (awkward phrasing and word order)  
- [LEXICON] "His drawing has become strong, his modelling firm..." (repetition and inconsistent phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He has surrendered to the pseudo-classicism of his age, and some of his compositions are absurdly indebted to mythology; but the fault was a virtue then, and while we complain it is only right to refer the grievance to the time rather than to the man..." (overuse of semicolons and run-on sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a tense encounter with bolo-men to a discussion of an artist's style and techniques (disconnected ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The section moves abruptly from a narrative of a journey to a critique of an artist, then to a description of a leper settlement, and finally to a philosophical reflection on life (lack of clear narrative flow)  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the artist's critique and the description of the leper settlement (jarring shift in subject)  
- [CLARITY] "A study of Boswell explains the painter's attitude, even though it cannot justify it." (unclear reference to Boswell and its relevance to the painter)  
- [LOGIC] The philosophical conclusion about life and love in the leper settlement is introduced abruptly and lacks a clear connection to the preceding narrative (sudden thematic shift)
