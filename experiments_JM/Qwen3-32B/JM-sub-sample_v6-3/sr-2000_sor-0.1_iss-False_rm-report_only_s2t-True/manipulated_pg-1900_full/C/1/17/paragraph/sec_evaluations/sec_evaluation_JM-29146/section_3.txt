Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "whithpered" (should be "whispered")  
- [SPELLING] "elth" (should be "else")  
- [SPELLING] "pleth" (should be "please")  
- [SPELLING] "latht" (should be "last")  
- [SPELLING] "abrevitog" (likely a typo or neologism, but inconsistent with surrounding text)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had never heard of Garr Symm, and he thought he knew most of the big shots..." (awkward phrasing, could be smoother)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He said curtly: 'Let go of her, Symm. She told me nothing that would interest you.'" (missing comma after "Symm")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey had a room, rent one Irwadi month in arrears..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He could see nothing. The door hinges squeaked." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [GRAMMAR] "You're armed," the unseen girl's voice said in crisp, amused English, "like I'm a six-legged Antarean spider-man." (awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the action in the gambling hall to a philosophical aside about Reynolds ("Nobody in these days would deny for a moment that Reynolds possessed qualifications...")  
- [LOGIC] The Reynolds paragraph is unrelated to the main narrative and disrupts the flow  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the gambling hall to Ramsey's room is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The term "m.g. gun" is used without prior explanation, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the genre  
- [CLARITY] The term "abrevitog" is unclear and may be a typo or neologism that lacks context  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Ramsey's room to the Earthgirl's introduction is jarring and lacks smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The Earthgirl's sudden appearance and knowledge of Ramsey's gun is not clearly explained or foreshadowed
