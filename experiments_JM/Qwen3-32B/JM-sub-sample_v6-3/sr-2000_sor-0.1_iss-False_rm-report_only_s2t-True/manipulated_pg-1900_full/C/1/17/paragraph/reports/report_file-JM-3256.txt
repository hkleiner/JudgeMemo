        • Cumbersome sentence structure in "He has much to say on Homer, and a good deal also on 'Flogging in Schools'; he can hardly let go Immanuel Kant, but if he does it is to give his views, which are not favourable, of _Wilhelm Meister_; he is not above considering the art of cooking potatoes or the question of whether human beings once had tails..."
