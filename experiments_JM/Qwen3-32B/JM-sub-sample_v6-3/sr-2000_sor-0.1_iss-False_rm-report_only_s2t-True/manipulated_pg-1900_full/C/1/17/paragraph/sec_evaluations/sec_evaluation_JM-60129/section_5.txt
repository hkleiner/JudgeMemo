Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "your eye was caught at once by a temple-like building, which is used by the monastery, and a couple of rather more capacious houses" (subject-verb agreement and clarity issues)  
- [SPELLING] "K'anglungssu" (inconsistent or non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "The rooms are almost completely dark, very small, and black with soot" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "your eye was caught at once by..." (shift in perspective from third-person to second-person)  
- [GRAMMAR] "some dozens of houses, were grouped the majority of them low..." (sentence structure error)  
- [SPELLING] "K'anglungssu" and "K'anglungssu" (inconsistent spelling of the same term)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The lamas living in this monastery do not number more than fifteen, all ages included" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SPELLING] "Stongsko" and "Stongsko" (inconsistent capitalization or spelling)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The lamas are supported by voluntary contributions in payment for their services as prayer-readers" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "K'anglungssu" and "K'anglungssu" (inconsistent spelling)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the monastery to discussing Reynolds and his paintings (no clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the description of the monastery to a completely unrelated section on Reynolds and his art  
- [CLARITY] "His children, too, are seldom of this world" (unclear reference to "his")  
- [LOGIC] The section on Reynolds is entirely disconnected from the preceding and following content about the monastery and lamas  
- [TRANSITION] No transition or explanation for the shift from the monastery to Reynolds' art  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Reynolds and his paintings is out of context and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] "The lamas are supported by voluntary contributions in payment for their services as prayer-readers" (confusing phrasing)  
- [LOGIC] The text moves from a detailed description of the monastery to a completely unrelated anecdote about Reynolds, then back to the monastery without explanation
