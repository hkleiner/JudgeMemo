Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Viewed in the light of their second station ... they manifest absolute servitude..." (fragmented sentence structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Even as He saith: 'I am the servant of God. I am but a man like you.'" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [LEXICON] "solatium" (rare or archaic word that may confuse modern readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The Reports of these two Commissions are very amusing, especially that of the Oxford Board, which lets itself go in a refreshing style." (run-on sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "apoplexy" (correct spelling but may be misread due to context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Victorian social reformers to the state of universities (lack of clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] Jump from the universities to the Civil Service, Army, and then to foreign politics (disjointed progression)  
- [CLARITY] "Viewed in the light of their second station..." (unclear reference to "second station")  
- [TRANSITION] "It seemed to me that there was a great lack of energy..." (abrupt shift in tone and perspective)  
- [LOGIC] Mention of the Boer War in the context of the Crimean War without clear connection (confusing temporal reference)
