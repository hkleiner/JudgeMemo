Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the dissolution of the two great monasteries and the demolishing of Becket's shrine" (awkward parallelism)  
- [SPELLING] "Â£30 in a scented purse" (special character may be problematic in some contexts)  
- [SYNTAX] "the sweeping away of all the Shakespearean landmarks and relics from Stratford-on-Avon of to-day would imply" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [LEXICON] "the city could afford to present Queen Elizabeth with Â£30 in a scented purse" (somewhat archaic or unclear phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the city could afford to present Queen Elizabeth with Â£30 in a scented purse when she came thither in 1564" (awkward structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the city could afford to present Queen Elizabeth with Â£30 in a scented purse when she came thither in 1564" (awkward use of "thither")  
- [SYNTAX] "the modern pilgrim, whose course is thus arrested by the vision he sees in this cleft called Mercery Lane, might have had some intention of going straight through the city to St. Martin's Church outside the walls to the east" (long and complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He stands for a moment transfixed, and then plunges into the opening, forgetful of his original purpose in the vivid reality before him" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The smooth turf along the south side of the Cathedral was used by the monks as a lay cemetery" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "contrary to the usual custom, on the north" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the history of Canterbury to a brief mention of Reynolds and his artistic ambitions (disconnected from the main narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Reynolds feels out of place and unrelated to the preceding detailed description of Canterbury Cathedral and its history  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed architectural and historical description of Canterbury to the unrelated story of Reynolds is abrupt and jarring  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "this" in "To wipe out Becket's name completely Henry VIII. would have needed to demolish the whole church" is somewhat unclear without more context  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Reynolds is introduced without any prior indication or connection to the rest of the text, making it feel like an unrelated afterthought  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
