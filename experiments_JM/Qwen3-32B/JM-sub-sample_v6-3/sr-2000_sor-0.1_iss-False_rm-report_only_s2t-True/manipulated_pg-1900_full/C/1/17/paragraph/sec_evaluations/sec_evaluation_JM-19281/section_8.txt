Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "a paralysis of ability to address effectively the problem of evil" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the negation of the good that evil represents, as with darkness, ignorance or disease, is severely crippling in its effect" (cumbersome structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the phenomenon may represent the operation of influences entirely different in nature from the familiar ones--influences that can properly be described only as spiritual" (repetition of "influences")  
- [SYNTAX] "One will search in vain for another association of human beings in history--political, religious, or social--that has successfully survived the perennial blight of schism and faction" (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Bahá'í community's unity to historical examples of rebellion and tribute collection in ancient Palestine and Syria (disconnected ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about ancient Palestine and Syria is out of context and does not logically follow the previous discussion about unity and Covenant-breaking  
- [CLARITY] The transition from the discussion of Covenant-breaking to the historical example is abrupt and confusing  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph on Covenant-breaking is introduced abruptly and lacks a clear connection to the preceding paragraph  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
