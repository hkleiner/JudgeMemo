Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The transportation vehicles of the 1860’s did not require the wide, straight highways of the present." (awkward phrasing and outdated possessive apostrophe usage)  
- [SPELLING] "Jordon Point" (likely a typo, should be "Jordan Point")  
- [SYNTAX] "It was the railroads more than the highways, however, which gave to Petersburg a significance out of all proportion to its size." (awkward word order)  
- [LEXICON] "The damage done by such raids was quickly patched up, but they were a constant nuisance to the city’s transportation lines." (repetition of "transportation lines" is redundant)  
- [SYNTAX] "The very length and size of the fortifications proved to be a disadvantage." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between descriptions of roads, railroads, and fortifications without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the Dimmock Line abruptly shifts to the June 9, 1864, raid without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Col. Alfred Roman" is introduced without prior context, making it confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of Petersburg’s infrastructure to the Battle of Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph ends mid-sentence, leaving the reader hanging and disrupting the narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
