Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The failure of the generality of humankind in this respect has, time and again, condemned entire populations to a ritualistic repetition of ordinances and practices long after these latter have fulfilled their purpose and now merely stultify moral advance."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of complex and archaic vocabulary that may hinder readability for some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and long sentences without clear breaks, making some sections difficult to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in "In the absence of scriptural texts that established unarguable institutional authority, clerical elites succeeded in arrogating to themselves exclusive control over interpretation of the Divine intent."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Dungan revolt to abstract theological concepts without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between historical, theological, and philosophical ideas with little to no connecting context, making it difficult to follow the central argument.  
- [CLARITY] Some ideas are expressed in a highly abstract or metaphorical way, which may obscure the intended meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially between the section on the Dungan revolt and the theological discussion.
