Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The favorable publicity won by the use of these 'old-fashioned' types on Strathmore papers, convinces me..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] "Caslon types on Strathmore papers having proved so popular, business was humming." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SPELLING] "A 'Victor' bicycle catalog for the Overman Wheel Company, involving a long run in two colors on Strathmore book and cover papers..." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "and also the employment of an additional pressman and two additional feeders, and keeping the presses running nights as well as days..." (repetition and awkward structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "With no one trained to carry on in my absence it was necessary to cease publication..." (missing article and awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "forms were lifted from the presses and transferred to the University Press at Cambridge; and the Wayside Press as a unit, including name and goodwill and my own services, soon followed..." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "Carlyle and Ruskin were its chief prophets; but we must not forget the novels of Dickens, Charles Reade and Kingsley." (awkward transition and missing article)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the growth of the printing business to the decision to move the press is abrupt and lacks explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from the business expansion to the personal failure without clear cause-effect explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the business decisions and the eventual collapse is not clearly established.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the business narrative to the "Interlude in New York" chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the young man in New York is presented as a fictionalized version of the author, but the connection to the previous narrative is unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The tone shifts from a reflective business narrative to a whimsical, almost satirical description of the young man in New York, which is jarring and lacks cohesion.
