Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one morning about the end of the second week..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Khaki" is misspelled as "Khaki" (though correct, it is inconsistent with the rest of the text's spelling style)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is needless to say that positions in Manila and Iloilo were now at a premium." (awkward and overly formal)  
- [LEXICON] "Was it possible that teachers were to be sent to places where even the necessaries of life could not be obtained!" (repetition of "possible" is redundant)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "each individual in this wonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities." (missing punctuation at the end of the sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Was it possible that many would be sent to places so remote that for six months no fresh supplies could be gotten!" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Of course, this diplomatic move tided affairs over..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth from the tower..." (incorrect use of "pealing" instead of "pealing" or "pealing")  
- [GRAMMAR] "One young woman of about eighteen, who was leaning against a rock by the roadside sobbing, when her husband passed..." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The reign of force was at an end; it was going out with them; the reign of peace had begun; it was coming in with us." (awkward and repetitive structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the description of Manila to a historical discussion about England and Europe ("This prolonged jealousy and suspicion between the two western powers...")  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from the description of the town to a historical narrative unrelated to the main storyline  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the town to the historical narrative is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the ghost ("Well, I quite admit it," said the Ghost, petulantly, "but it was a purely family matter, and concerned no one else.") is out of place and unrelated to the rest of the text  
- [CLARITY] The text references "the writer" in the section "Almost every one heeded the warning..." without clearly identifying who "the writer" is  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from the narrative of the journey to a description of the wagon and mules without a clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from the description of the troops to the emotional scene of the women without a clear narrative connection
