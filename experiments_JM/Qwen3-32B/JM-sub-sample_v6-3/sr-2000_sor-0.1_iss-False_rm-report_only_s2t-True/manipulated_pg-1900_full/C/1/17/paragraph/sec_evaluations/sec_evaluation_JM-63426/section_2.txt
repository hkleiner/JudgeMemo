- [LEXICON] "having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window" (Unnatural phrasing; unclear meaning)  
- [GRAMMAR] "he is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings" (Awkward phrasing; missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is an inveterate sportsman in a land where game, deer and fish, is plentiful." (Subject-verb agreement error)

- [CLARITY] "The two jobbers are kicked." (Unclear what is being kicked and why)  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "space-suited figures" is jarring and out of place in an otherwise historical narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the print shop to the story of the soap seller and Mr. Newett shooting the kerosene tank.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the print shop to the artist's studio in Chicago is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative thread.
