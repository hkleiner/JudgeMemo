Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A certain amount of success attended the policy; the king’s Nubian “Pidati” were dreaded from of old..." (awkward phrasing with "from of old")  
- [SYNTAX] "When it was a mere question of hundreds in the field against hundreds..." (repetition of "hundreds" is awkward and unclear)  
- [SPELLING] "The knowledge that Egypt was far away, and that the Son of the Sun was highly exalted..." (no issue, but "Son of the Sun" is a title and not a grammatical error)  
- [LEXICON] "The stream of rhetorical devotion flowed on in the letters." (somewhat vague and stylistically awkward)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "But in the face of perpetual complaints and counter-complaints, entreaties for help and what were for the most part incredible assurances of everlasting fidelity..." (long sentence with poor punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the previous section to the current one is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Tell el Amarna letters is introduced without clear context or connection to the prior discussion.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Nimmuria" and "Napkhuria" is confusing without prior explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the military policy to diplomatic correspondence is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "But to define what constitutes happiness is very difficult," she replied, is out of context and disrupts the flow.
