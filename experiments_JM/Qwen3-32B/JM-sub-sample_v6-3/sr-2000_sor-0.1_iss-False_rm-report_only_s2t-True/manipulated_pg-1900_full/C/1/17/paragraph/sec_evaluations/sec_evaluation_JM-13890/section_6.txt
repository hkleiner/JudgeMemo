Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The effect of emptiness existing to-day is vastly different to what the pilgrims used to gaze upon..." (awkward phrasing and incorrect preposition use)  
- [SYNTAX] "It may be that average lives are so planless, so haphazard and without order that an achievement of such magnitude representing years of labour and concentrated thought in steadily following out a preconceived plan cannot fail to be a tremendous contrast..." (overly complex and convoluted sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [LEXICON] "the feverish clinging to the ideals of the totem post" (unclear or overly abstract phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "the actual scene, but the historic entrance is by the south porch facing the great gate of the priory, and as it is still the usual place of entry this short account of the interior will begin at that point." (run-on sentence with missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "All this barbarous crowding of colour and ornament, all this splendour of a ritual that appealed to an age capable of stilling the voice of conscience with an absolution obtainable for a few pence has passed away..." (awkward and overly wordy phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He hunted the now extinct bison (antiquus), two species of the American horse (Equus fraternus and E. complicatus), a rare four-horned antelope (Tetrameryx), the California condor, camel, ground sloth, and a muskox or caribou-like animal (Bootherium sp.)." (inconsistent use of parentheses and missing commas)  
- [GRAMMAR] "By going closer and examining the pavement, a shallow groove appears marking the exact position of the base of the shrine." (passive voice and awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the cathedral to a military strategy involving Grant and Lee, with no clear connection to the rest of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between architectural descriptions, historical anecdotes, and unrelated narrative segments (e.g., Marie and Adolphe), making it difficult to follow a single thread.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the cathedral to a description of a prehistoric hunter, with no logical or contextual link.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It may be that average lives are so planless, so haphazard and without order that an achievement of such magnitude representing years of labour and concentrated thought in steadily following out a preconceived plan cannot fail to be a tremendous contrast..." is unclear and lacks focus.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Sir T." in the monument list is incomplete and confusing, with no further elaboration.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression or unifying theme, making it difficult to determine the author's intent or focus.
