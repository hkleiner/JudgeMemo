Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have here," the empress told me, "a little gift which I have brought you on behalf of the Emperor." (awkward placement of dialogue tags)  
- [SYNTAX] "the nations, exhausted by the struggle, signed the Peace of Paris in 1763." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "diffused light spreading softly through a misty haze over the slumbering earth." (repetitive phrasing and lack of variety)  
- [LEXICON] "She planned for herself a laborious and tranquil existence, rendered all the pleasanter through the devoted and watchful affection of her old friend..." (redundant and wordy)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "In 1860, the great artist, being overburdened with work and unable to carry on simultaneously the instruction and practice of her art, resigned her position as director." (overuse of commas, making the sentence hard to follow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from Choiseul to Reynolds to Rosa Bonheur without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different historical figures and events without clear organization.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the Peace of Paris and the abolition of the Jesuits is not clearly explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Empress's visit to the Universal Exposition is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the art school is inserted as a parenthesis, which disrupts the flow of the main narrative about Rosa Bonheur.
