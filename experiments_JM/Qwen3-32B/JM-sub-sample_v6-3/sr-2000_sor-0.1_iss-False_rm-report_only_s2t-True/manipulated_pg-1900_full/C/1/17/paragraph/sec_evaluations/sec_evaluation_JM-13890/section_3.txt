Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Archbishop sate" (archaic or incorrect verb form)  
- [SPELLING] "sate" (likely incorrect; should be "sat")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the day on which all the great events of Becket's life had taken place; for not only had he been born on a Tuesday, but on that day he had been exiled..." (cumbersome structure)  
- [LEXICON] "rude Saxon times" (ambiguous or unclear use of "rude")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in dialogue sections (e.g., missing quotation marks or inconsistent line breaks)  
- [SYNTAX] "the historian found nothing to compare with it but Solomon's dedication of the Temple!" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "sumpter-mule" (hyphenated word may be non-standard or unclear)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from historical narrative to an out-of-context dialogue: "O.K. Pay me back when you get a chance. There are plenty of hyper-space jobs waiting for us all over the galaxy, you know that." (disrupts narrative flow and context)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the murder of Becket to a dialogue that appears unrelated to the main narrative  
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you..." (unclear who "Cecil" is or how this relates to the main narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the historical account and the dialogue segments, which appear to be inserted without explanation or context  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Dean Stanley's 'Historical Memorials of Canterbury'" but then continues with a detailed account of the murder, creating a confusing narrative structure
