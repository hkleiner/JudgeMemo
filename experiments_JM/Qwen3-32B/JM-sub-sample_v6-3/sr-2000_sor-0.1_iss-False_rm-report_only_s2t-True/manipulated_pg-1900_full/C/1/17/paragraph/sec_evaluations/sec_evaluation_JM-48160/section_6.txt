Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "dying after a short illnes" (misspelling of "illness")  
- [SPELLING] "illnes" (misspelled word)  
- [SYNTAX] "I shall always be glad that I have seen 'with my own eyes'" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "a lama is called upon to read prayers" (potentially confusing use of "lama" without context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "The short time at my disposal did not give me much opportunity for a thorough study of their customs. The little I was able to note, follows here:")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from French soldiers to a description of burial customs (lack of clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from battlefield observations to cultural practices (burial customs)  
- [CLARITY] "The bourgeoisie which has reduced the birth rate in France" (vague and potentially misleading statement)  
- [TRANSITION] Jump from the description of French villages to the mention of "lama" and burial customs (no clear connection)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the description of the war zone to a critique of American attitudes toward the war (lack of smooth transition)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
