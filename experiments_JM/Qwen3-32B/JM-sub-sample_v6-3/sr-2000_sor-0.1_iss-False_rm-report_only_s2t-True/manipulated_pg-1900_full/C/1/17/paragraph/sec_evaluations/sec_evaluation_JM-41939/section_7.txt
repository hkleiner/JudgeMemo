1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one spoke..." (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "She has piously preserved the memory of her benefactress..." (somewhat archaic or overly formal tone)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of the staircase flew back..." (missing conjunction between clauses)  
- [SPELLING] "The Cow and Bull in Auvergne, Cantal Breed..." (missing article "a" before "Cantal Breed")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Rosa Bonheur's death to a scene involving Mr. Otis and Virginia, with no clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events and characters without smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The Virginia scene is introduced abruptly and lacks context, making it confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Rosa Bonheur's death to the Virginia scene is jarring and unexplained.  
- [LOGIC] The Virginia scene appears unrelated to the rest of the text, creating a disjointed reading experience.
