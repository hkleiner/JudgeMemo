Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days being thus closed in the face of all beings..." is awkward and grammatically unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "The Source of infinite grace, ... hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear..." is overly archaic and disrupts the flow.  
- [LEXICON] "The Source of infinite grace, ... hath caused..." uses archaic language inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- [SPELLING] "pi" is likely a typo for "ink" or "type," which affects clarity.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Long, run-on sentences with excessive commas and no clear breaks reduce readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift to a spiritual and archaic passage ("The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days...") is jarring and unrelated to the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The spiritual passage interrupts the chronological and biographical flow of the story.  
- [CLARITY] The archaic language in the spiritual passage is confusing and does not align with the rest of the text’s tone or content.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the boy’s daily life to the spiritual passage is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
