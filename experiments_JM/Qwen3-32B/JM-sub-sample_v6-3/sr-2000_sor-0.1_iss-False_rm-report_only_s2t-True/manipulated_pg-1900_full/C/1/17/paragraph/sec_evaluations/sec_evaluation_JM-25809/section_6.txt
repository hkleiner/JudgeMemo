Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "Pla-a-ay" and similar phonetic spellings disrupt standard fluency.  
- [SYNTAX] "P'r'aps w'en I've got er chist and t'umpers on me like you, I'll like der udder kin' er song," has awkward phrasing and non-standard syntax.  
- [LEXICON] "Yaggering" is an unusual or possibly incorrect word choice.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in dialogue lines (e.g., "Pla-a-ay your fifes l-o-o-w-l-y, a-a-nd beee-eat your drums sl-o-o-o-wly, and play the dead m-a-arch as you carry me o-o-o-on!").  
- [SPELLING] "Weldon Railroad" and "Jerusalem Plank Road" are spelled correctly but the transition to the Bahá'í section is jarring and lacks fluency.  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'ís" and "Bahá'u'lláh" are correctly spelled but the shift in tone and subject is abrupt and affects fluency.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a narrative about Jim and Ches to a discussion about Bahá'ís and Bahá'u'lláh's teachings is jarring and illogical.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly transitions from a story about a mountain lion and a boy to a philosophical and religious discourse, making the structure disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The shift in subject and tone is confusing and lacks any clear connection or transition.  
- [TRANSITION] No transition or explanation is provided for the shift from the wilderness narrative to the Bahá'í teachings, making the text feel fragmented.
