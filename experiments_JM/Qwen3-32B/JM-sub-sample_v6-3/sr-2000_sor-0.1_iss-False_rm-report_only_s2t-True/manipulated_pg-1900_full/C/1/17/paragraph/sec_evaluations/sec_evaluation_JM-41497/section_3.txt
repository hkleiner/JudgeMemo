Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He has surrendered to the pseudo-classicism of his age, and some of his compositions are absurdly indebted to mythology; but the fault was a virtue then..." (awkward phrasing and unclear connection between clauses)  
- [SYNTAX] "With reflection has come a questioning of all established authority..." (inverted syntax that disrupts natural flow)  
- [LEXICON] "The productions of his first youth and of his old age stand best of all." (vague and imprecise phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some awkward word choices (e.g., "flaneurs")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Rattlesnake Springs, (source of the Parkâ€™s water supply), about 7 miles south..." (misplaced parentheses and awkward punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Reynolds' artistic techniques to global integration and modern philosophical reflections.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Reynolds' personal life, artistic legacy, and unrelated topics like the Mescaleros and Apache farming.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the philosophical discussion of global integration to the biographical details of Reynolds.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between Reynolds' artistic choices and the broader philosophical themes is unclear.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the Mescaleros and Apache farming seems disconnected from the main narrative about Reynolds.
