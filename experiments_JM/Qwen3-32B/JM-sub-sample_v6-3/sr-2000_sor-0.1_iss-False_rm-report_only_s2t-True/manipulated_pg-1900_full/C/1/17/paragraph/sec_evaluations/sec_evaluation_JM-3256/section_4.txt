1) Fluency Issues:

- [LEXICON] "The dealer in this place so loved his books that he almost preferred a customer who knew them above one who bought them" (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He created that dainty, pleasant atmosphere that comes floating up to the windows on a fresh morning in Paris from the musical cries of the street vendors; but of the deeper significance of the street-sellers--of the miserable accent in their life, of their weary toil, of the dignity of their labour--he knew nothing" (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)

- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from a historical and literary narrative to a philosophical and scientific discussion with no clear connection or progression  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about "the matter transmitter" and "proto-man" is disconnected from the rest of the text and lacks context or explanation  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the bookman narrative to the science fiction concept is abrupt and confusing
