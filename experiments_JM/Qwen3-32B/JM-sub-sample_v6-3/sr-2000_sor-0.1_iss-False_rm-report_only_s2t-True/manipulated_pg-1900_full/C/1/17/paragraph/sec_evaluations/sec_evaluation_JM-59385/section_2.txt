Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia"  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the fragmented lines "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia"  
- [SPELLING] "culmination of the alliance had waited but the year to be set by the contracting families as the eighteenth spring of Kuei Ping’s life" is awkward and unclear  
- [LEXICON] "sickening sweet perfume of the purple soi bean" is an unusual and potentially confusing phrase  
- [SYNTAX] "The old woman felt the shudder and the tense strain of the girl’s body as she fastened the tiny buttons of the collar of Kuei Ping’s dress" is wordy and could be more concise  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the memory of the graduation day to the wedding ceremony is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The fragmented lines about the wedding ("Wherein there is a wedding...") disrupt the flow and clarity of the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the memory of Miss Porter to the soothsayers and the wedding preparations is jarring and lacks a logical progression  
- [LOGIC] The detailed description of the wedding preparations feels disconnected from the earlier narrative about Kuei Ping's internal conflict  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
