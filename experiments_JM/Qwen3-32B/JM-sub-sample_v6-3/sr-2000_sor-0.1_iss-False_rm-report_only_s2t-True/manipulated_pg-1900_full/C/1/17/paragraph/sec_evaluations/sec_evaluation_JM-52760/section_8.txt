Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "part of Sheridan’s forces which has pushed northwest" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "Rowanty Creek" (likely a typo, should be "Rappahannock" or another plausible name)  
- [SYNTAX] "The problem of assigning a proper significance to Five Forks is a difficult one." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the Southside Railroad—the last remaining communication link between Petersburg and the South, which continued to deliver a trickle of supplies to the city." (redundant phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a romantic scene ("Mildred rushed to him...") to military history with no contextual connection  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the romantic interlude to the continuation of the battle narrative  
- [CLARITY] The interjection of a spiritual/philosophical passage ("Consider the past...") is jarring and unrelated to the military narrative  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the romantic and spiritual interludes and the military history sections  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
