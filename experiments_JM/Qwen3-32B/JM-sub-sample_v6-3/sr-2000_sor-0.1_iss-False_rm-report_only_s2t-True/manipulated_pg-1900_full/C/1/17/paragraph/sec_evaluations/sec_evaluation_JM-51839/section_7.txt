Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Comandante" is misspelled (should be "commandante").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "Gen. Thomas J." (period or comma).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "After the Texas Revolution this house was sold under execution on a judgment against Colonel Jose de las Piedras and became the property of Gen. Thomas J."  
- [SPELLING] "Marked by the State of Texas" is repeated multiple times with no variation in phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a list of historical sites with minimal transitions between them, making the flow disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] Some entries are very brief while others are more detailed, creating an uneven narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The repetition of "Marked by the State of Texas" at the end of many entries is distracting and reduces clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between the different sections (e.g., from "NACOGDOCHES UNIVERSITY" to "EPISCOPAL CHURCH") makes the text feel fragmented.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
