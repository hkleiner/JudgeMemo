Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Rather, are such persons driven..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Rather, are they reciprocal features..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] "The culture of systematic growth taking root in the Bahá'í community would seem, therefore, by far the most effective response..." (awkward phrasing and excessive length)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "the "community of interest"." (missing space after quotation mark)  
- [SYNTAX] "the Divine Plan bequeathed it by the Master is the means by which this work is carried out." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the nature of covenant-breaking to the broader achievements of the Bahá'í community without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between abstract philosophical ideas and practical community activities without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] Some concepts (e.g., "community of interest") are introduced without sufficient explanation for clarity  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the first chapter to the second is abrupt and lacks logical connection  
- [LOGIC] The second chapter begins with a broad statement about modernity but quickly shifts to religious texts without clear relevance to the prior discussion
