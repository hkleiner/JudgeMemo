Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The map, head sketches and photos not credited are by the author." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "A dream grew then,--to found a home school..." (misplaced punctuation and awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "fanatically-crazed" (hyphenation inconsistency)  
- [LEXICON] "The fatty places in which they had squeezed more than twice their earnings taken away..." (confusing phrasing and word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Wherein the narrator becomes Kuei Ping’s pupil and is filled with wondering questions and is witness to a dream come true in its threefold parts" (awkward and overly poetic phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "I approached the stuffy cubby hole, in which my private teacher waited, with lagging steps..." (awkward structure and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's story to the narrator's experience in the classroom with little transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The ending abruptly shifts to the narrator's perspective and the "threefold parts" of the dream, which is unclear in context  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph introduces a new character (the narrator) and perspective without sufficient setup or explanation  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping's life story to the narrator's experience is abrupt and lacks smooth connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the narrator becomes Kuei Ping’s pupil" is introduced without prior context or explanation  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
