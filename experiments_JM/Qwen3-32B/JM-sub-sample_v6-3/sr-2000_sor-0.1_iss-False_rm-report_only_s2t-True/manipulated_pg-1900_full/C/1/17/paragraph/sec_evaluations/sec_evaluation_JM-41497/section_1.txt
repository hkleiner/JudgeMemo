Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise his own limitations..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Reynolds started life as a clever young man determined to make a name." (missing punctuation after "name")  
- [SYNTAX] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The years between 1749 and 1752, devoted by Reynolds to studying and copying the Vatican frescoes..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Sir Joshua had a supreme facility for taking from every artist the best that was in him, melting it in the crucible of his own thought, and applying the product to his pictures." (missing comma after "him")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Increasingly, uncertainty about the meaning and value of life generates anxiety and confusion. Speaking about this condition in our own age Bahá’u’lláh says:" (sudden shift in topic without clear connection to Reynolds)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Reynolds' biography, general commentary on art, and philosophical reflections without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The astonishing progress in all measurable values which marked the first half of the reign produced a whole literature of complacency." (vague and ambiguous phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "The years between 1749 and 1752, devoted by Reynolds to studying and copying the Vatican frescoes..." (sudden shift from general commentary to specific biographical details)  
- [LOGIC] "Sir Walter Armstrong thinks that Reynolds lived well rather than wisely in Italy, and that when he came back to town his wild oats were all sown..." (unclear connection to the broader narrative)
