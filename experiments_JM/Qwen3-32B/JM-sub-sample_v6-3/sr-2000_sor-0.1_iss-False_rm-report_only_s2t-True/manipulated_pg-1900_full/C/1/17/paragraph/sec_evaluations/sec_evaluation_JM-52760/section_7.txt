Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The greater part of their time was primarily utilized by digging..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "They lived in rude improvised shelters, often made of mud and log walls with tent roofs." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [LEXICON] "Chimneys were made of mud and barrels." (somewhat unusual phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "There was some friendly interchange of words and gifts between the lines, but enmity was more rampant than brotherly regard." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from a narrative about the soldiers' daily life to a list of battle dates and locations.  
- [LOGIC] The list of battle dates and locations is not clearly connected to the preceding narrative, creating a disjointed reading experience.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "FORT GREGG, FORT MAHONE, FORT SEDGWICK, FORT FISHER" is unclear in context and lacks explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the soldiers' hardships to the historical accounts of the siege and the "special artists" is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from a general description of the campaign to a detailed account of Lee's final gamble without clear signposting or logical progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
