Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The 48th Regiment proposed to dig a long gallery from the bottom of the ravine behind their picket line to a point beneath the Confederate battery at Pegram’s Salient, blow up the position by powder placed in the end of the tunnel, and then send a strong body of troops through the gap created in the enemy’s line by the explosion." (Awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "Pegram’s (sometimes called Elliott’s) Salient" (Parentheses usage is acceptable, but the phrasing is slightly awkward)  
- [SYNTAX] "Who shall do justice to the crowds that thronged the studio?" (Sudden shift to unrelated topic with a rhetorical question disrupts fluency)  
- [LEXICON] "Deafness could hardly have been an unmixed evil to a man whose sitters were of the most diverse kind." (Unusual phrasing and word choice may confuse readers)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to unrelated topic about Sir Joshua Reynolds and his studio in Leicester Square (disrupts the narrative flow and logical progression)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Sir Joshua Reynolds is disconnected from the military context and appears to be an error or misplaced text  
- [CLARITY] The transition from the military description of Pegram’s Salient to the unrelated studio scene is abrupt and confusing  
- [TRANSITION] The text abruptly returns to the military narrative after the unrelated studio description, creating a jarring shift in context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
