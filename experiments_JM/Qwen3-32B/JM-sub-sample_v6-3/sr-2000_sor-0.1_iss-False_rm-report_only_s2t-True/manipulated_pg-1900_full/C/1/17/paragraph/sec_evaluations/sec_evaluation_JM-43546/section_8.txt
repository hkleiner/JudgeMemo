2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a detailed description of Scottish customs and a party to a section about the "Shera Yögurs" and "Sarö (Kara) Yögurs" with unclear relevance.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly transitions from a narrative about Scottish children and their party to a list of administrative divisions and names that appear unrelated.  
- [CLARITY] The section on "Shera Yögurs" and "Sarö (Kara) Yögurs" is confusing and lacks explanation, making it difficult to understand its connection to the rest of the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the party and Scottish customs to the administrative division section is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "tewky" at the end is unclear and seems disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
