Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had thrown up his commission, he had thrown up his book, he had thrown up everything but the instant need to hurry to Rapallo..." (awkward repetition of "he had thrown up")  
- [SYNTAX] "I wrote him a letter which was to await him at Aden—I besought him to relieve my suspense." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [LEXICON] "That he had found my letter was indicated by a telegram which, reaching me after weary days and in the absence of any answer to my laconic dispatch to him at Bombay, was evidently intended as a reply to both communications." (overly complex and convoluted sentence)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I can certainly not be said to have sat down, for I seem to remember myself at this time as rattling constantly between the little house in Chelsea and my own." (awkward use of "for" to connect clauses)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We all spent during this episode, for people of our means, a great deal of money in telegrams and cabs..." (awkward phrasing and misplaced modifier)  
- [SYNTAX] "I lived with my heart in my mouth and accordingly bounded to the window..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He intimated that the charm of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "At bottom I was troubled by the disparity of the two accounts; but after a little I felt Corvick’s to be the one I least doubted." (awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the protagonist's impatience to the arrival of the young lady with the message, without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The passage moves between multiple characters and events (Corvick, Gwendolen, Vereker) without clear organization or progression.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "He intimated that the charm of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source" is unclear.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the protagonist's impatience to the arrival of the young lady is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the protagonist's personal experience to the narrative about his brother in Germany is abrupt and lacks clear connection to the previous section.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely interlaced..." is vague and lacks clarity.
