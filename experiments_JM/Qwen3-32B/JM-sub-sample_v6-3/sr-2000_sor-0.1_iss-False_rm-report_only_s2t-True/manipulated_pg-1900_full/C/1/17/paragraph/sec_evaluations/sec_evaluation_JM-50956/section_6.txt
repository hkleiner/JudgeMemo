Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia's Losses--12,000,000" uses an em dash inconsistently and disrupts flow.  
- [SYNTAX] "From this brief outline one can readily see..." is awkwardly phrased and overly formal.  
- [LEXICON] "That city is none other than the Word of God..." is a non-sequitur and unrelated to the preceding content.  
- [SPELLING] "comprize" is used incorrectly; the correct form is "comprise."  
- [SYNTAX] "Thus do simple figures tell us clearly and plainly..." is archaic and stylistically inconsistent.  
- [STRUCTURE] The sentence "Very coldly she answered, 'Not in the least;'" is out of context and disrupts the flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "That city is none other than the Word of God..." is completely unrelated to the surrounding content and breaks the logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the statistical analysis of Russian losses to the unrelated quote about a woman's response is jarring and illogical.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps abruptly from historical military analysis to a mystical or religious statement, then back to military analysis, creating confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Very coldly she answered..." lacks context and is unclear in relation to the rest of the text.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion section lists numbered points, but the numbering is inconsistent (e.g., point 2 is missing).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
