Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Lords of the South Plains," as they were later called, looked and dressed every bit the now “Hollywood” Indian.  
- [SYNTAX] "stuck them in a dead, ripe skunk to create the same effect" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [LEXICON] "gewgaws" is an uncommon word that may confuse some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrases in some sentences.  
- [SPELLING] "bids a hearty welcome to all comers within her borders" is slightly awkward in phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Comanches appears abruptly and is thematically disconnected from the preceding and following content.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Comanche section to the conclusion about Nacogdoches is jarring and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the historical sites is well-structured, but the earlier Comanche section disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical narrative to the Comanche description lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
