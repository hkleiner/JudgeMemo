Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ology" is misspelled  
- [GRAMMAR] "the fabric and the remarkable font have been examined" – awkward phrasing with unnecessary repetition of "the"  
- [SYNTAX] "We are always sowing our future; we are always reaping our past" – slightly awkward parallelism  
- [LEXICON] "hoary antiquity" – archaic phrasing that may be confusing to some readers  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing St. Martin's Church to a broader discussion of Canterbury's remaining attractions, then to a philosophical reflection on history – lacks smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the continuity of history feels disconnected from the preceding descriptions of buildings and sites  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the section on St. Martin's Church and the broader list of Canterbury's attractions  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the Industrial Revolution" and "French monarchy" in the final paragraph is abrupt and lacks contextual connection to the rest of the text  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
