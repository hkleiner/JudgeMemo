Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "She had the rough accent of Provence; was thick-set and clumsy of figure, and of heavy features"
- [SPELLING] "a-painting" and "a-kissing" are non-standard phrasings
- [SYNTAX] "He brought to his homeliest pictures a beauty of arrangement, a sense of style, and a dignity worthy of the most majestic subjects" is overly complex
- [SPELLING] "giving" is missing in "He was too keen an artist, his was too original a genius"
- [SYNTAX] "He simply took from them such part of their craftsmanship as could enter into the facile gracious genius of France without clogging its grace" is awkwardly constructed
- [SPELLING] "He is now content with his house and garden for scenery, with his family for models" has awkward phrasing
- [SYNTAX] "The figure of a man, known as 'Figure de Fantaisie' or 'Inspiration,' is stated with a directness and vividness worthy of the great Dutch master" is awkwardly phrased
- [SPELLING] "He played as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil" has awkward phrasing

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Fragonard's marriage to discussing Boucher's death and political events
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (Fragonard's marriage, his artistic development, Boucher's death, political events) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] The connection between Fragonard's artistic development and the political events at the end is unclear
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Fragonard's marriage and family life to Boucher's death is abrupt
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Boucher and political events seems disconnected from the rest of the text about Fragonard's marriage and artistic development
