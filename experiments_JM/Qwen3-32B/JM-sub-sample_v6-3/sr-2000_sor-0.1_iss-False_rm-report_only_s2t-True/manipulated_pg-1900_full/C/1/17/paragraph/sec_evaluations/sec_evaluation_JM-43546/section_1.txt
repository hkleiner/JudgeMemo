Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is the opposite failing from that of Macaulay..." is a run-on sentence with unclear subject-verb agreement.  
- [SYNTAX] "Matthew Arnold is also a religious sceptic; but he has formulated..." has awkward punctuation and structure.  
- [SPELLING] "sceptic" is British English spelling; may be inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- [LEXICON] "It was not a happy time for religious thinkers, unless they made themselves quite independent of organised Christianity." is overly complex and unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "Intolerance was very bitter; and only the secular arm stopped a whole series of ecclesiastical prosecutions..." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Real hatred was shown against the scientific leaders, which Darwin calmly ignored, and Huxley returned with interest." has unclear antecedent for "which."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Macaulay, Matthew Arnold, and religious scepticism is unrelated to the preceding and following narrative about Donald and the puppy.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the narrative about Donald and the puppy to the unrelated historical and religious discussion is abrupt and jarring.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph on religious scepticism and historical context is unclear in its relevance to the overall story.  
- [TRANSITION] The return to the narrative about Donald and the puppy after the unrelated paragraph is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
