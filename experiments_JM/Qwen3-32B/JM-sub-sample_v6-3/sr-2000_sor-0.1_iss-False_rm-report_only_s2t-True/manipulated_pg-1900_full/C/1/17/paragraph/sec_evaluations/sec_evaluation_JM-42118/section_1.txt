Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He'll find me when he's ready" is stylistically inconsistent with the rest of the text.  
- [SPELLING] "pleasaunces" is an archaic or misspelled word.  
- [SYNTAX] "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse" is overly complex and awkward.  
- [LEXICON] "metates" and "mano" are technical terms introduced without context, disrupting the flow.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Long sentences with multiple clauses lack appropriate punctuation, making them hard to follow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "metates" and "mano" is abruptly inserted and unrelated to the surrounding narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts from a historical narrative about Fragonard to a description of archaeological tools without transition.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Irwadi City" and the "Vegan girl" is jarring and out of place in a historical biography.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Grasse to the political and artistic developments in Paris is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
