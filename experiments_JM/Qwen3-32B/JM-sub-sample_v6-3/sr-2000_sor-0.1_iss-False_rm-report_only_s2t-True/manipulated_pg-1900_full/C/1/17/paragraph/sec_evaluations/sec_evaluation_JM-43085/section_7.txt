Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would have been able, by rummaging there, to clothe from top to toe whole generations of bourgeoise, nobles, and labourers..." (awkward phrasing and missing article before "bourgeoise")  
- [SPELLING] "nineteeth" instead of "nineteenth"  
- [SYNTAX] "He quite literally bought out the stock of second-hand dealers in the Temple market, which up to the middle of the nineteeth century was the sales place of old clothes once worn by our great-grandparents and their ancestors." (cumbersome and wordy sentence structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "And we know,--his fine passion for the truth was always cropping out,--that he actually suffered..." (misuse of em dashes)  
- [LEXICON] "He would have been able, by rummaging there, to clothe from top to toe whole generations..." (awkward and archaic phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "We must not smile! For herein lay the secret of greater suppleness in the folds." (sudden shift in tone and unclear connection to the previous sentence)  
- [TRANSITION] "And when, detail by detail, his documentation had been completed, what endless sketches, experiments, rough drafts had to follow!" (abrupt transition from documentation to creative process)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Meissonier's obsession with historical accuracy, his collection, and his artistic process without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "He quite literally bought out the stock of second-hand dealers in the Temple market..." (vague reference to "Temple market" without context for modern readers)
