Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A t'umu acts as judge..." contains an unusual and inconsistent term "t'umu" that disrupts fluency.  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" is misspelled.  
- [SYNTAX] "It was not finished when, in 605, Augustine died..." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [LEXICON] "The imminence of further change..." uses "imminence" in a context that is confusing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Bishop Luidhard, who had come over as her chaplain about the year 575, when the marriage with the heathen Ethelbert had taken place." has a run-on clause.  
- [SPELLING] "t'umu" is inconsistently written and not explained.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "t'umu" introduces a completely unrelated topic (possibly from a different cultural or geographical context) without explanation or connection to Canterbury or the rest of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from the history of Canterbury to a description of a legal system that appears unrelated.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "t'umu" and the legal system is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to determine its relevance.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed historical narrative to the unrelated "t'umu" section is jarring and disrupts the flow.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "t'umu" is not resolved or connected to the rest of the text, leaving the reader confused about its purpose.
