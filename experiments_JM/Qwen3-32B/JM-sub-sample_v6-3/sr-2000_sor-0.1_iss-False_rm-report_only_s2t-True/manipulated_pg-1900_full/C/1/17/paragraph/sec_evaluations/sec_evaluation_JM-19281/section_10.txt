Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the population of the earth has been endowed with the powers and capacities equal to the task" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling, not incorrect but inconsistent with American English if that is the assumed standard)  
- [SYNTAX] "You need help and advice," said the visitor, his voice sounding like that of a disciple of the healing art, and implying that he had thoroughly diagnosed the case. (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the present-day order will be rolled up" (idiomatic expression may be unclear to some readers)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a theological discussion to a dialogue ("You need help and advice," said the visitor) disrupts the flow and context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the theological content to the dialogue is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the dialogue is unclear and seems out of place in the context of the preceding theological discussion.  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition or explanation is provided to justify the shift in tone and content from the theological to the narrative.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
