Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "we put ---- on the map in athletics" (missing name in placeholder)  
- [SPELLING] "equipments" (incorrect plural form)  
- [SYNTAX] "The janitor never missed a meeting and was one of the most interested listeners" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "rough-house" (should be "roughhouse" as one word)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The pupils in ---- had little or no opportunity for group evening entertainment and heartily welcomed the suggestion of forming a literary society"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to a quote from an "impresario" with no clear connection to the preceding or following content  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different school activities (athletics, literary society, school news) with minimal transitional phrases  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "----" in multiple places (e.g., "The pupils in ----") without clear context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the athletic association to the literary society without a clear link  
- [LOGIC] The quote from the Seattle principal is introduced without explanation or connection to the preceding narrative
