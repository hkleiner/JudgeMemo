Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "reined iu my horse" (likely a typo for "reined in my horse")  
- [SPELLING] "tshuavá and sujá" (unusual or non-standard spelling, possibly intentional but distracting)  
- [SYNTAX] "the bright eyes of the t'umu's adopted daughter -- bright dark eyes..." (awkward repetition and punctuation)  
- [LEXICON] "precipitate themselves headlong down to the water" (unusual phrasing for the context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation in complex sentences  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing farewell to detailed geographical and topographical description without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from emotional farewell to a technical description of valleys and rivers feels abrupt and disconnected  
- [CLARITY] Some descriptions of the landscape are overly detailed and may confuse the reader about the narrative's focus  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between the farewell scene and the journey to Li-yen  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
