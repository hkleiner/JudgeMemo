Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Dashes and commas used inconsistently, e.g., "cows, sheep and horses, -- the price being always paid in live stock --"  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the men have usually known women before and it is by no means rare that the bride also is well initiated in these mysteries"  
- [SPELLING] "Sarö Yögurs" and "Ta fumu" may be non-standard spellings but are consistent  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or unclear terms like "navel-string" and "Ta fumu" may confuse readers  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in lists, e.g., "tea, with salt, milk, cream and butter, roasted flour, boiled meat, (beef or mutton), paste cut in narrow strips (eaten in soup) and gin"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from wedding customs to infidelity and bigamy without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from one topic to another (e.g., from wedding to child-rearing to physical appearance)  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transitions between paragraphs, especially between the wedding section and the section on infidelity  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The section on the Sarö Yögurs and the Ta fumu appears disconnected from the earlier cultural descriptions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
