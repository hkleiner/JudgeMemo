Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "As the dining room beyond and, no doubt, the hotel itself, was crowded with officers" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "déjeûner" (uncommon spelling may be intentional, but could be distracting)  
- [SYNTAX] "I must have walked fully a kilometer from that station, when, asking once more to be directed to the Hotel du Commerce, I was told that I stood before it." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "I had a vision of these flies rising in a dark cloud from the battlefields of Verdun and traveling to Bar-le-Duc on top of the hundreds of covered army wagons that go back and forth daily." (word choice is unusual and slightly confusing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some complex sentences  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the hotel experience to a philosophical reflection on Germany and historical references without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the author’s personal experience and broader historical commentary, disrupting the flow  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the hotel scene to the mention of Wordsworth and Fichte without clear linkage  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about flies and their imagined origin is somewhat disjointed from the rest of the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
