1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was a quiet and sylvan scene when I saw it, but when guns at the front are thundering, reminding these men that their comrades in arms are falling momentarily, or taubes are drumming overhead searching out the barracks, it seems to me that sustained optimism must be a difficult feat." – Awkward phrasing and run-on sentence.  
- [SPELLING] "indefatigable taube" – "taube" is a misspelling of "taube" (a type of German reconnaissance plane, correctly spelled "taube").  
- [SYNTAX] "If the delicacies always craved by the sick will raise the spirits..." – Awkward and confusing structure.  
- [LEXICON] "It was a quiet and sylvan scene when I saw it, but when guns at the front are thundering..." – "sylvan" is an unusual and somewhat archaic word choice that may confuse readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "chemist shop, surgical dressings stores, &c.," – Inconsistent punctuation with the use of "&c." instead of "etc."  
- [GRAMMAR] "I saw nothing more interesting at these hospitals than the bathtubs for the wounded brought straight from the front." – Awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement.  
- [GRAMMAR] "If they are grand blessés they must receive as little handling as possible." – Missing article ("the") before "grand blessés."  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is done in five minutes and may save his life. In other respects I saw nothing to criticise in these military hospitals..." – Sudden shift in tone and structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "I never saw any one look more ill." – "any one" should be "anyone."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Hôpital Central is beautifully located in a high valley just outside of Bar-le-Duc and looks like a new mining town." – Awkward comparison.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from describing the hospital facilities to the personal story of a woman with thirteen children and a floating kidney, with little transition or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between descriptions of hospital logistics, personal anecdotes, and broader reflections on war and national identity, making the overall structure feel disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the private kitchen is introduced and then partially lost in the middle of the text, with the focus shifting to other hospital details.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the bathtubs to the issue of hospital kitchens is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the Hôpital Central and the women of the Red Cross feels disconnected from the earlier discussion of dietary needs and hospital logistics.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the doctor was inexorable" is unclear and lacks context, leaving the reader confused about the situation.
