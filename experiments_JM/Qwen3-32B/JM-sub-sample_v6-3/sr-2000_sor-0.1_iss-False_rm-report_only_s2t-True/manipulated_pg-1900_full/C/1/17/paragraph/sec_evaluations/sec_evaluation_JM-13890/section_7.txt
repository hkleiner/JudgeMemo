Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "if one may call it such when the Dove is not represented" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SYNTAX] "which were carried at the funeral as the Prince had ordered in his will" is slightly unclear due to the placement of "as the Prince had ordered."  
- [LEXICON] "the chair of Purbeck marble in which the Archbishops are enthroned" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.  
- [SYNTAX] "As it is no longer considered as old as the days of Augustine the title St. Augustine's Chair must be regarded as a figure of speech" is a run-on sentence with poor structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Huguenot Chapel in what was the Black Prince's Chantry" is missing a preposition ("in which") for clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "This very short description of such a building must be regarded as a mere introduction to the study of a vast subject, for in the space available nothing more is remotely possible" is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the interest of the various periods of Norman and Transitional work" is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SYNTAX] "where the colour is as splendid as in any of the early windows at Chartres" is slightly unclear due to the placement of "where."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the tomb to the "eastern extension of the chapel" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the windows in Trinity Chapel shifts abruptly to the description of the crypt and the Huguenot Chapel, making the flow disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the first shrine" in the context of the windows is unclear without additional context.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the description of the windows to the tombs of the archbishops is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Huguenot Chapel and the Tudor period is disconnected from the previous discussion of the cathedral and its history.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about the "very short description" feels tacked on and does not smoothly conclude the section.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "an earlier chapter (p. 17)" is confusing in the context of the current section.
