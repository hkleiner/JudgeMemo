Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Toward the end of His life, Bahá’u’lláh’s writings on His early experiences included a brief description..." (inconsistent pronoun usage "His" when referring to a non-human entity)  
- [SPELLING] "parrakeets" (non-standard spelling; "parakeets" is more common)  
- [SYNTAX] "Also, in depicting him as associated with the toil of animals, she shows him to us only under a useful and noble aspect..." (awkward phrasing and word order)  
- [LEXICON] "The ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion..." (inconsistent tone and unclear meaning of "infecting")  
- [STRUCTURE] "Choiseul had planted his strength deep in the people's party, and was come near to being its god." (archaic phrasing disrupts fluency)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Rosa Bonheur's studio and menagerie to a reference to Bahá’u’lláh with no clear connection  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Rosa Bonheur's artistic career to a historical/political statement about France and Choiseul  
- [CLARITY] "The ideas of the New Philosophy were infecting public opinion..." (unclear reference to "New Philosophy" and its relevance to the narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the detailed description of Rosa Bonheur's studio and the unrelated historical/political content at the end  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
