Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "But it is only as the instrument of His purpose, and that purpose is characteristically practical." (fragmented sentence, lacks clarity and connection to prior context)  
- [SYNTAX] "Not a bit," Vereker laughed main. (likely a typo: "main" should be "man")  
- [SPELLING] "He dared to laugh main." (likely a typo: "main" should be "man")  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from a dinner scene to a philosophical discussion about religion and civilization with no transition.  
- [LEXICON] "He dared to laugh main." (incorrect word usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained shift from the dinner scene to a philosophical discussion about religion and civilization.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the dinner scene to the discussion of Reynolds and then to the religious passage is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [CLARITY] The religious passage is dense and abstract, making it difficult to connect with the preceding narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The narrative jumps from a personal anecdote to a philosophical reflection without any clear transition or context.
