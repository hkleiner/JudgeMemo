Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "It is not by recomposing the evolved with itself that we shall reproduce the evolution of which it is the term."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and philosophical terms without clear definitions, e.g., "noumenal Cause," "interpenetrating whole of reality."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, e.g., "It would take us too far from the line of Spencer's thought to consider M. Bergson's doctrine..." (awkward structure).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and line breaks, e.g., the use of line breaks in dialogue without clear punctuation.  
- [STYLE] Repetition of phrases such as "we are told" and "we are to be told" without variation.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are abstract and lack clear logical progression, e.g., the transition from Bergson's "original activity" to Spencer's "Unknowable" is not clearly explained.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between philosophical concepts and historical references (e.g., the painting at the Louvre) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of certain phrases is ambiguous or unclear, e.g., "the chopping up of a continuous interpenetrating reality into mince-meat for intellectual assimilation."  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between topics, such as from Bergson's philosophy to Bertrand Russell's critique, without sufficient contextual linkage.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text oscillates between abstract philosophical discussion and concrete examples (e.g., the painting) without a clear unifying thread.
