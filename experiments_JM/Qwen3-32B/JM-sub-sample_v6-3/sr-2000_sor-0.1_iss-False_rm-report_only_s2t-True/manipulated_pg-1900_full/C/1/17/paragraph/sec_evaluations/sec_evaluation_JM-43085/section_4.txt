Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he is a bibliophile, and he is in the midst of old books!" (redundant "he is")  
- [SYNTAX] "The manner in which he is placed in the centre of the picture, one elbow resting on the table, one leg crossed over the other, one hand hanging idly by his side, his body sunk within his gaping waistcoat, his head bowed forward in revery, or jovially thrown backward,--all this forms a composition..." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas and em dashes without clear separation of clauses  
- [LEXICON] "the adorable odour of old bindings" (somewhat archaic or overly poetic phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had learned to give to every face that profundity, to every scene that intensity of action, that constitutes his individual bigness." (awkward phrasing and unclear antecedent for "that")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Mr. Otis's dialogue to a discussion of Meissonier's artistic success without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different examples of Meissonier's works and quotes from critics without a clear narrative thread  
- [CLARITY] The description of "The Smoker" and the two different characters is lengthy and could be confusing without visual reference  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of "The Reader" to the awarding of medals is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Mr. Otis's dialogue seems out of place and unrelated to the broader discussion of Meissonier's career  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
