Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He is much indebted to a London publisher for a very careful edition of the _Spectator_, and still more to that good bookman, Mr. Austin Dobson, for his admirable introduction."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "He is much indebted to a London publisher for a very careful edition of the _Spectator_," (should be "an edition").  
- [SPELLING] "roxburghe" is misspelled (should be "Roxburghe").  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "He has much to say on Homer, and a good deal also on 'Flogging in Schools'; he can hardly let go Immanuel Kant, but if he does it is to give his views, which are not favourable, of _Wilhelm Meister_; he is not above considering the art of cooking potatoes or the question of whether human beings once had tails..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The bookman, in fact, is a quite illogical and irresponsible being, who dare not claim that he searches for accurate information in his books as for fine gold..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He does not care, and that may be foolish, whether he agrees with the writer, and there are times when he does not inquire too curiously whether the writer be respectable, which is very wrong..."  
- [SPELLING] "Savile" is likely a proper noun and should be capitalized.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "In the days of calf love every boy has first tasted the sweetness of literature in two of the best novels ever written, as well as two of the best pieces of good English."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We used to pass the tuck-shop at school for three days on end in order that we might possess _Leaping Deer_, _the Shawnee Spy_."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Again and again have I tried to find one of those early friends, and in many places have I inquired, but my humble companions have disappeared and left no signs, like country children one played with in holiday times."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the bookman's literary preferences to the Mescalero Apaches with no clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different literary figures and themes without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the bookman" is consistent, but the narrative lacks a clear progression or unifying theme.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the Mescalero Apaches to the anecdote about finding _Monte Christo_ in a bookshop.  
- [LOGIC] The text moves from personal recollections of reading to general commentary on literature without clear logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, making it feel like a collection of loosely connected thoughts.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the very heart of oneâ€™s library of fiction" is vague and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Balzac and his position in French literature feels disconnected from the preceding discussion of English authors.
