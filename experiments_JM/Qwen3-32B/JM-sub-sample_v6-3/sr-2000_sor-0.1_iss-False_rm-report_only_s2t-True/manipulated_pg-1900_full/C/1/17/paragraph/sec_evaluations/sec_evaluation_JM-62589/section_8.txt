Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The wish was but a fleeting one. Go back? What had he to go back for?" (awkward phrasing and incomplete thought)  
- [SYNTAX] "All that he had in life to look forward to, lay nearâ€”if it existed at all." (awkward structure and unclear phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "by near his tired eyes" (likely a typo or missing word)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was praying. It was no new thing for Washington to plead for help from a mightier power, all his men knew, and honored him, for his childlike faith." (awkward and run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Robert tried to reply but his voice failed him." (missing comma for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would deliver the message in an hour or die in the attempt." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The army was divided in three parts" (should be "into three parts")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He could not recross the river. His proud spirit quailed at the thought of retreat, but to engage in another battle just then might mean ruin." (awkward transition and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He could not recross the river. His proud spirit quailed at the thought of retreat, but to engage in another battle just then might mean ruin." (sudden shift in logic without clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from the battle in Trenton to the planning of the next move without clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] "There is but one thing for us to do." (unclear what the "one thing" is until the next sentence)  
- [LOGIC] "At sun rise you may try to escape and join us." (confusing phrasing and unclear reference to "sun rise")  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the battle to the council of war is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
