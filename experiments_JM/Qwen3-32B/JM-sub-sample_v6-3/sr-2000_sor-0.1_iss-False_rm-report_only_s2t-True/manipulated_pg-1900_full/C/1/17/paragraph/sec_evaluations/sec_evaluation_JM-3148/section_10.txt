- [GRAMMAR] "Anthony goes to see Miss Butterfield consid’able often." (informal contraction and awkward phrasing)

- [GRAMMAR] "It would be strange if them two left-overs should take an’ marry each other; though, come to think of it, I don’t know’s ’t would neither." (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s blind, to be sure, and can’t see her scarred face. It’s a pity she ain’t deef, so ’t she can’t hear his everlastin’ fiddle." (informal phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I declare, she reminds me of a Jack-o’-lantern, though if you look at the back of her, or see her in meetin’ with a thick veil on, she’s about the best appearin’ woman in Edgewood." (awkward phrasing and informal contractions)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had me make him three white shirts and three gingham ones, with collars and cuffs on all of ’em." (informal phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It seems as if six shirts at one time must mean something out o’ the common!" (awkward phrasing and informal phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "At forty Boucher has come into his kingdom." (sudden shift in tone and style)

- [LOGIC] The section about Ramsey and the "Vegan girl" includes references to "Irwadian" and "m.g. gun" that are not explained or contextualized  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Anthony and Lyddy is abruptly interrupted by the unrelated section about Ramsey and the "Vegan girl"  
- [LOGIC] The section about Ramsey and the "Vegan girl" includes a character named "Garr Symm" who is not introduced or explained  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Anthony and Lyddy is abruptly resumed after the unrelated section about Ramsey and the "Vegan girl" without any transition
