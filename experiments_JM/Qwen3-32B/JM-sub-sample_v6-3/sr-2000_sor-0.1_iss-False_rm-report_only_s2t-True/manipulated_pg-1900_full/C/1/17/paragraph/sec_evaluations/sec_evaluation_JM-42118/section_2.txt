Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The bride is given a dowry, according to the wealth of her parents and the sum which has been paid for her." (sudden shift in subject and tone, inconsistent with the rest of the text)  
- [LOGIC] "On the wedding day the lama is called upon to read prayers, in the homes of both bride and bridegroom." (abrupt and unrelated to the preceding narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in subject and tone from the French artistic narrative to a description of a dowry and lama, with no transition or context.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from the narrative of Fragonard's artistic development to a description of a dowry and lama, which is unrelated and unexplained.  
- [TRANSITION] No logical or contextual transition connects the artistic narrative to the unrelated content about dowries and lama.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph introduces a completely different cultural context without explanation, making it confusing and disconnected from the rest of the text.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
