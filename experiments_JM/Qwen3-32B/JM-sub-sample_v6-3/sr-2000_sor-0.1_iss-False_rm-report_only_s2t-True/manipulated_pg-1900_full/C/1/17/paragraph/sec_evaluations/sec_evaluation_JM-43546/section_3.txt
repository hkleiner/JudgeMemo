Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Yes, but you must," said Sanders. (Name inconsistency: "Sanders" vs. "Sandy" used earlier)  
- [SYNTAX] "Napkhuria’s great weakness was his obvious partiality for those of his officials who had become Aten worshippers..." (Awkward phrasing and complex structure)  
- [SPELLING] "tewky" (Unconventional spelling, but contextually acceptable; not a spelling error)  
- [LEXICON] "he was not a bit spoiled; he was a warm-hearted laddie..." (Slight awkwardness in transition between clauses)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "and was very fond of eating 'petticoat-tails' at tea-time,--a name which you would never imagine..." (Misuse of em dash)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Donald and Sandy's daily life to historical and linguistic background about French influence in Scotland (Abrupt transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] Jump from the boys' school and play to a discussion of Hebrew and religious rituals (Disjointed structure)  
- [CLARITY] "Napkhuria’s great weakness..." (Unclear reference to a historical or fictional figure, not previously introduced)  
- [TRANSITION] "And so was 'Rob Roy,' who soon learned just what hour Donald might be expected..." (Unclear connection between "Rob Roy" and the narrative)  
- [LOGIC] "Yes, but you must," said Sanders. (Sudden, unexplained dialogue with no context or resolution)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
