Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He may be your butler. Or you may be his butler." (awkward phrasing and unclear antecedent)  
- [SYNTAX] "And also you will see that you did well not to publish your excellent intentions." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "a efforst on quite a small group..." (missing article "an")  
- [LEXICON] "And nobody will be aware that you have failed in striving." (repetition of "striving")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The dungeon was wrapped in thick darkness, and Our fellow-prisoners numbered nearly a hundred and fifty souls: thieves, assassins and highwaymen." (inconsistent capitalization of "Our")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the cultivation of goodwill to a vivid description of a dungeon with no clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from advice on personal goodwill to a narrative about a dungeon and fellow-prisoners, disrupting the flow.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Our fellow-prisoners" and the dungeon is confusing in the context of the previous discussion about goodwill.  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the section on personal cultivation of goodwill and the unrelated prison narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The prison narrative is introduced without explanation and is not resolved or connected to the main theme.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
