1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He came even nearer to the kernel of the significance of things" – awkward phrasing and unclear reference.  
- [SYNTAX] "with crown to his many infamies the scandalous Pacte de Famille" – confusing structure.  
- [SPELLING] "fatuity" – repeated and may be a typo for "fatuousness" or "fatuousness" (though "fatuity" is correct, it is used inconsistently).  
- [LEXICON] "He was to be a deluge indeed--scarlet red." – unclear and awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "Had not the owners of the land the right to do what they would with their own?" – archaic phrasing that may confuse modern readers.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Eucharist being hustled about the passages, whilst the bigots strove against its administration" – awkward and unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] "France had lain supine, a mighty people as they proved themselves when their right arms were freed" – confusing and awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Du Barry had striven to abolish the lettre de cachet; the new king brought it back, inaugurating his reign by having one sent to the woman whose gentleness and kindliness had shrunk from the accursed thing." – overly complex and confusing.  
- [SYNTAX] "He was now at the height of his career; and was to taste wider success." – awkward and redundant.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He now travelled in the grand style as the guest of a man of affairs, visiting palaces and churches, received in state by the highest in the land, dining with the Ambassador of France, having audience of the Pope, advising Bergeret de Grandcour in the buying of art-treasures." – run-on sentence with poor structure.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from political commentary to personal anecdotes about Fragonard, making the narrative flow disjointed.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the death of Louis XV to Fragonard's journey to Italy is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Du Barry" is unclear in some contexts, especially for readers unfamiliar with the historical background.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the political downfall of the French monarchy to the personal story of Fragonard and his patron is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "la belle Emma–Nelson's Emma" is confusing without context and disrupts the flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final section about the legal dispute between Fragonard and Bergeret de Grandcour feels disconnected from the broader narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the consequences of them were to strip him bare and wreck him" is vague and lacks clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The text moves from historical events to personal stories without clear thematic or narrative links.
