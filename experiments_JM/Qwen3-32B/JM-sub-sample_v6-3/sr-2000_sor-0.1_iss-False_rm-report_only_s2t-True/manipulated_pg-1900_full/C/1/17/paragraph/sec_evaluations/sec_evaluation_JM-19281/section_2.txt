Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Its most extreme form, the iron dogma of 'scientific materialism', sought to reinterpret every aspect of history and human behaviour in its own narrow terms." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling, not incorrect but inconsistent with American English if that is the assumed standard)  
- [SYNTAX] "The view took root that, since people were essentially self-interested actors in matters pertaining to their economic well-being, the building of just and prosperous societies could be ensured by one or another scheme of what was described as modernization." (long and complex sentence with unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The closing decades of the twentieth century, however, sagged under a mounting burden of evidence to the contrary..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development has left no doubt that not even the most idealistic motives can correct materialism's fundamental flaws." (awkward and complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Consumer culture, today's inheritor by default of materialism's gospel of human betterment, is unembarrassed by the ephemeral nature of the goals that inspire it." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Tendencies once universally castigated as moral failings mutate into necessities of social progress." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Under appropriate euphemisms, greed, lust, indolence, pride--even violence--acquire not merely broad acceptance but social and economic value." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "With all the gross inequities that global integration perpetuates--indeed intensifies--no informed observer can fail to acknowledge the stimulus to reflection about reality that such changes have produced." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It can disentangle the lower strands from the higher in that motley collection of national literature which, extending over many generations of authorship, streaked with strayed fragments of Aramaic, varying from the idyll of Ruth to the apocalyptic dreams of Daniel, and deprived by Job and Ecclesiastes of even a rambling epical unity, is naturally obnoxious to criticism when put forward as one uniform Book, still more when put forward as uniformly divine." (extremely long and complex sentence with unclear structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing global integration to a narrative about Lord Canterville and Virginia, which seems unrelated to the broader context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from a philosophical and historical discussion to a narrative about Lord Canterville and Virginia, which disrupts the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence about the "motley collection of national literature" is unclear and difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of global integration to the Lord Canterville anecdote is jarring and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the "motley collection of national literature" is disconnected from the preceding discussion and appears to be an excerpt from a different text.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
