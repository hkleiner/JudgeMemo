Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He said curtly: 'Let go of her, Symm. She told me nothing that would interest you.'" (fragmented sentence structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "The explosion was expected at 3:30 a.m. Time passed slowly and the men, huddled behind the lines, grew more apprehensive." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [SPELLING] "Encyclop√¶dia" (uncommon spelling may be intentional but could be distracting)  
- [LEXICON] "Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring..." (word choice is unusual and may be confusing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Does not Marvell, lamenting his death, record in words curiously like Bismarck's that his deceased hero..." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from historical analysis to a narrative about a skeleton and Virginia without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the historical account of the explosion to a poetic lament and then to a narrative scene  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between the historical analysis of England and the unrelated narrative about a skeleton  
- [CLARITY] The narrative about the skeleton and Virginia is disconnected from the broader historical context  
- [LOGIC] The text moves between different historical periods and narrative styles without clear justification or connection
