Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was getting a hundred and twenty pounds a year now; so his chances of becoming a millionaire had increased by twenty per cent." (awkward phrasing and illogical comparison)  
- [SYNTAX] "In acknowledgment of this courtesy Excalibur always sent his love to the curate--Eileen wrote every Friday--and he and Eileen walked together..." (awkward punctuation and structure)  
- [LEXICON] "We simply have to tell some one." (archaic spelling "some one" is inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh" (difficult to read for some readers, but not a spelling error)  
- [SYNTAX] "Through that door and along the floor of the gallery they laid a square wooden pipe." (sudden shift to unrelated technical description without context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrative about Excalibur and the curate to a technical description of a ventilation system in a tunnel.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from a romantic and emotional narrative to a technical explanation with no clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of a "wedding feast" and bride's dowry at the end appears unrelated to the rest of the text and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the London scene to the tunnel ventilation system and then to a wedding scene is jarring and lacks logical connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
