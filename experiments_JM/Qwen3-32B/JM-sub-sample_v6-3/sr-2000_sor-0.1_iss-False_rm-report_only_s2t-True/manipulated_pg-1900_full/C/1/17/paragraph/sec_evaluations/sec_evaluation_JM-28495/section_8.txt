Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "This was about two thirds of the salary Lord Caversham paid his chauffeur." (missing hyphen in "two-thirds") - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas after dialogue tags in several instances - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of em-dashes and quotation marks - [SYNTAX] "He asked another question in his curious, abrupt staccato manner:--" (double dash is non-standard punctuation)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Lord Caversham's conversation with the curate to the tramp at the rectory without transition - [STRUCTURE] The chapter break appears in the middle of a narrative sequence without clear indication - [TRANSITION] The transition from the curate's salary discussion to the tramp's appearance is abrupt and lacks narrative connection - [CLARITY] The phrase "He meant 'up'" in reference to the dog's behavior is confusing without more context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
