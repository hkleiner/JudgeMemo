Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "So he signally failed--or shall I say that he succeeded only by ignoring..."  
- [SPELLING] "smudgy" is an informal or incorrect word choice  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was one other meeting that night, very short indeed, but not the less significant" – awkward and overly complex structure  
- [LEXICON] "We need to name it in some way; and this is the way that is, rather unfortunately, sanctioned by custom and long usage" – wordy and unclear phrasing  
- [SYNTAX] "But there was one other meeting that night, very short indeed, but not the less significant" – confusing structure and redundancy  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from philosophical discussion of causality to a narrative about Adolphe and Marie without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical concepts, historical references, and a narrative scene, making it difficult to follow a single thread  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "ground" and its use in logic is introduced abruptly and without sufficient explanation  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the philosophical discussion to the historical account of the Anasazi is abrupt and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The mention of physiological processes at the end seems disconnected from the preceding philosophical and historical content  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
