Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "exeptionally" instead of "exceptionally"  
- [SPELLING] "neigbourhood" instead of "neighbourhood"  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The soldier taught that inward mail to wear / And fearing God, how they should nothing fear?"  
- [LEXICON] "The cattle were chiefly yak cows, grey and black, both with horns and hornless." – unclear phrasing  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the line break between "Does not Marvell, lamenting his death, record in words curiously like Bismarck's that his deceased hero" and the quoted lines  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to discussing Marvell and Bismarck without clear connection to the Yögurs or the surrounding context  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on mescal hearts and baked sotol leaves appears unrelated to the rest of the text and disrupts the flow  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from descriptions of daily life to the mention of game and traps, with no clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "kekliks" and "Yögur grave diggers" is vague and lacks explanation  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph on traps and snares feels disconnected from the broader narrative about the Yögurs  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
