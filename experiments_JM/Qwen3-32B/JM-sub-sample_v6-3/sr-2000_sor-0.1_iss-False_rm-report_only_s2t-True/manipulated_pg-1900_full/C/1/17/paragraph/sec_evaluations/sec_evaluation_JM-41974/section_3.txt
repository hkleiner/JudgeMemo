Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Back in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere..." – incorrect punctuation and phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "done with the drudgery of winning to Academic honour" – "Academic" should be "Academy" or "Académie".  
- [SYNTAX] "he straightway turned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth year..." – awkward phrasing and structure.  
- [LEXICON] "Boucher saw that the public were not falling over each other..." – "Boucher" is a misattribution; the text refers to Veronese, not Boucher.  
- [GRAMMAR] "It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute." – missing article before "fine stir".  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Veronese to Boucher without explanation or connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Boucher is entirely out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of Boucher is confusing and irrelevant to the discussion of Veronese.  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the section on Veronese's works and the unrelated paragraph about Boucher.  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly returns to Veronese after the Boucher paragraph, creating a disjointed narrative.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
