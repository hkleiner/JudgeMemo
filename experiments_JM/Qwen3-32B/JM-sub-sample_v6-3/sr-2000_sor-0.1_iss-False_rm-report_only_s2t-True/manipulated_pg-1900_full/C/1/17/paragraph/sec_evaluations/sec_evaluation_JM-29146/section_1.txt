2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey's story to a description of an elderly woman (Madame Bauche) with no connection to the main narrative
- [LOGIC] The phrase "You've got to avoid panic. If you panic, you're finished...." appears abruptly and is disconnected from the surrounding text
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from Ramsey's conversation with Englander to Sally Englander calling from the kitchen without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The text ends with an incomplete sentence ("Not today, Sally," - Englander said, looking at Ramsey gratefully.) which disrupts the narrative flow
- [CLARITY] The connection between Ramsey's situation and the description of Irwadi's titanium resources is not clearly established
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Irwadi's titanium resources back to Ramsey's story is abrupt and lacks smooth connection
