Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is not always easy to realise" (British spelling; acceptable but may be inconsistent with American spelling if not otherwise established)  
- [SYNTAX] "pictures that were remarkable in their year for colour that aroused the enthusiasm of connoisseurs" (awkward phrasing; nested clauses make sentence hard to follow)  
- [LEXICON] "the surface colour of many a celebrity is now as pale as the sitter's own ghost may be supposed to be" (somewhat archaic or poetic phrasing that may confuse modern readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "In his search after the secret of the Venetians he made many elaborate experiments at the expense of his sitters")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "pictures that were remarkable in their year for colour that aroused the enthusiasm of connoisseurs grew old even sooner than the sitters" (confusing comparison between pictures and sitters)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph shifts abruptly from discussing the deterioration of paintings to justifying a literary interpretation of Reynolds' work without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] "the harmony of line may remain, the harmony of colour has gone beyond recall" (vague and abstract phrasing that lacks concrete examples)  
- [TRANSITION] "At times the great artist's draughtsmanship was far removed from excellence" (sudden shift in focus from color to draughtsmanship without clear connection)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
