Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He could do no wrong" is awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "He rose to power in 1758; and at once stemmed the tide of disaster to France" has a run-on sentence with inconsistent punctuation.  
- [SPELLING] "Fragonard had at last to turn his face homewards; and dawdling through Italy with Saint-Non, staying his feet at Bologna and Venice awhile" has awkward phrasing and unclear syntax.  
- [LEXICON] "He was created Duc de Choiseul in December 1758" is repeated from the context and is not an issue in the current segment.  
- [SYNTAX] "He painted 'The High Priest Coresus slaying himself to save Callirhoë,' which, though badly hung at the Salon, and still to be seen at the Louvre, was hailed with high praise by the academicians and critics" is overly complex and hard to follow.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The only adverse criticisms of coldness and timidity levelled against it sound strange in the light of his after-career, which, whatever its weaknesses, was not exactly marked with coldness nor eke with timidity" has awkward phrasing and redundancy.  
- [SYNTAX] "He had indeed no taste for such things, no sympathy with ancient thought nor with the dead past" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was now producing works in considerable numbers--it is his first, his detailed period, somewhat severe in arrangement and style as to composition and handling--the years of 'Love the Conqueror,' the 'Bolt,' the 'Fountain of Love,' of 'Le Serment d'Amour,' the 'Gimblette,' 'Les Baigneuses,' the 'Sleeping Bacchante,' the 'Début du modèle,' and the like" is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [SPELLING] "He was now producing works in considerable numbers--it is his first, his detailed period" has awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "The Pompadour lived but a short while to enjoy her triumph" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Fragonard's return to Paris to the political actions of Choiseul is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between Fragonard's artistic career and the political events involving Choiseul and the Jesuits without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the violinist examined the instrument with the practised eye of an expert, and turning to Satan said..." is confusing and seems out of place in the context of the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Fragonard's artistic development to the political events involving Choiseul and the Jesuits is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the Jesuits and their conflict with Choiseul appears disconnected from the preceding discussion of Fragonard's career.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different subjects (Fragonard, Choiseul, the Jesuits, the Pompadour) without clear transitions or unifying themes.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the match that started the explosion" is unclear and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the Pompadour's death and the preceding political events is not clearly established.
