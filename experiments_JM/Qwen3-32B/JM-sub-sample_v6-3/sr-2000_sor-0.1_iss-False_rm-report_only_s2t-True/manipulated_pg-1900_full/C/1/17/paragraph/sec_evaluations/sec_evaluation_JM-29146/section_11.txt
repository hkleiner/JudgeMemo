Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] "They had, Ramsey knew, all of space..." is awkwardly phrased and disrupts the flow.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The transition from the emotional moment to "THE END" is abrupt and lacks closure. - [LOGIC] The dialogue feels slightly unresolved, leaving the reader with unanswered questions about their future.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
