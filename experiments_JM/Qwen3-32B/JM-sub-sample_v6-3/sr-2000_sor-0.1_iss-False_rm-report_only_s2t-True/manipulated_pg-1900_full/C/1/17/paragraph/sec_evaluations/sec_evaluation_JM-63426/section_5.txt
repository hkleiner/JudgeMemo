Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had worked in Ishpeming and Chicago so as to earn money to take me back to Boston where I hoped to study and become an artist, the profession of my father." (Awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "the profession of my father")  
- [SYNTAX] "I had a bed-ticking apron that had been made for me by my wife, copying the apron I had worn..." (Cumbersome and repetitive structure)  
- [SPELLING] "æsthetic" (Uncommon spelling may be distracting to some readers)  
- [LEXICON] "I was then twenty-seven and undoubtedly thought of myself as quite grown up..." (Slightly awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "‘When the tide is at the lowest, ’tis but nearest to the turn.’" (Quotation formatting is inconsistent)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "I now become a member of the newly formed Arts and Crafts Society of Boston, possibly a charter member..." (Sudden shift in focus from typography to personal involvement in a society)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between personal anecdotes, historical context, and business developments without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The books were uncatalogued and stacked in fireproof rooms which were called the ‘Barton Safes.’" (Ambiguous reference to "Barton Safes")  
- [TRANSITION] "And I chose a dandelion leaf as my device because the dandelion is a wayside growth." (Abrupt shift from the naming of the press to the choice of a symbol)  
- [LOGIC] "Displaying samples of his new line, Mr. Moses asked if I would lay out and print a showing for distribution to commercial printers and advertisers." (Sudden introduction of Mr. Moses without clear connection to the previous narrative)
