Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He seems to have thought he was acting as a good son and a shrewd man of business in fulfilling his father’s promises at so cheap a rate."  
- [SPELLING] "Comanches positive range" likely should be "Comanche’s positive range"  
- [SYNTAX] Unclear structure in "It may thus be assumed that Napkhuria at once ordered the transport to be brought back."  
- [SPELLING] "Yanhamu’s bias" is missing a closing quotation mark  
- [SYNTAX] "He was made of sterner stuff. What matters either the fate of such a one as Adolphe Bauche?" is disjointed and lacks clarity  
- [SYNTAX] "But thou hast said, ‘Fear not, but send a ship to the Yarimuta, and money and garments will come to thee thence.’ Now, behold, the troops which thou hast given me have fled, because thou hast neglected me, while I have obeyed thee." is overly complex and hard to follow  
- [SPELLING] "taken from his hand." is incomplete and lacks context  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Tushratta’s correspondence to the Park and Guadalupe Mountains area without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the letter to Teye to a discussion of the Comanche territory  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed transition from the Egyptian vassal letters to the mention of Aziru and his actions  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the capitaine—but what matters?" is unclear and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Adolphe Bauche appears out of context and is not explained  
- [LOGIC] The letter from Rib-Addi to Amanappa is difficult to follow due to its archaic and repetitive nature  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (Tushratta, Comanche territory, Egyptian vassals) without clear transitions
