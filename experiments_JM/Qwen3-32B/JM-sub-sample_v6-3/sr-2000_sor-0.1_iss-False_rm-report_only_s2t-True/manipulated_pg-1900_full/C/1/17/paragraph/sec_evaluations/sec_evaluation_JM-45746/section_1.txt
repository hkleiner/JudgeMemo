Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I must not accept just a mere job" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "commercial men of prominence" (redundant phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "My false aspirations had failed" (vague and imprecise)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "I was ready to go out into the world with a college diploma, but was unprepared for a definite position.")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator's personal experience to a historical account of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdad with no clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition from the school inspection to a discussion of Boucher's art, with no clear relevance to the teaching profession  
- [CLARITY] The narrative abruptly shifts between the narrator's experiences and unrelated historical or artistic references  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the school inspection and the agricultural teacher's story  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about "one man had made school teaching a job; the other had made it a profession" is unclear in its reference and lacks context
