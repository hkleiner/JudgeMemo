1) Fluency Issues:

- [SPELLING] "bourgeoise" (misspelled; should be "bourgeois")  
- [SYNTAX] "He would have been able, by rummaging there, to clothe from top to toe whole generations of bourgeoise, nobles, and labourers..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "He actually suffer because..." (incorrect word choice; should be "suffered")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Meissonier's dedication to historical accuracy to his personal sacrifice in slashing a painting, with minimal transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the "Gray Redingote" and the "working library" is followed by a detailed description of his research into linen, which is somewhat disjointed  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about Meissonier sketching himself to his broader passion for historical accuracy is abrupt  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "We must not smile! For herein lay the secret of greater suppleness in the folds." is unclear in its connection to the previous context  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
