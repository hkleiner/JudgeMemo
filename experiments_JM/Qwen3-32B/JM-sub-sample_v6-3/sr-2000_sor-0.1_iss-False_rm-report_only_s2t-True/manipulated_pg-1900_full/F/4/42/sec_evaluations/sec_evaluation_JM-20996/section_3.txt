Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the men shouldered their rifles and fell into line" (missing comma after "line")  
- [GRAMMAR] "call the lieutenant" (should be "called the lieutenant")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the women had until now restrained themselves" (should be "had until now restrained themselves" or "had restrained themselves until now")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the curtain had fallen upon a drama in actual life deeper in pathos than any other we had ever seen or ever expected to see" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the work of the teachers was, in short; to 'make the English language the basis of instruction in the public schools.'" (incorrect punctuation; semicolon should be a colon)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the work here have been in a measure simplified" (subject-verb agreement error; "have" should be "had")  
- [GRAMMAR] "it was also impossible to get the town council to provided a case" (should be "to provide a case")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Filipinos are not strong advocates of co-education" (awkward phrasing; could be rephrased for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the superintendent by one fall stroke removed everything in use" (should be "one fell stroke")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Ã©lite of town" (missing "the" before "town")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the emotional scene of the women to the description of Philippine towns is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The shift from the dramatic scene to the administrative details of the schools is jarring and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the "baile" and the social event is introduced suddenly after the emotional and educational sections, making the overall structure feel disjointed.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the soldiers' departure to the description of the towns in the Philippines is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative link.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the emotional farewell to the soldiers to the administrative and educational work of the teachers without a clear logical progression.
