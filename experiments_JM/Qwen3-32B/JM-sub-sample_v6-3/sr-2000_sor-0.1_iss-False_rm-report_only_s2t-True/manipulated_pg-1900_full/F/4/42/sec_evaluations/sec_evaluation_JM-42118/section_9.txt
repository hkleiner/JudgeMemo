Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "he is to be seen wandering about the Louvre dressed in a cloak or overcoat of a mixed grey cloth, without hooks or eyes or buttons"
- [SYNTAX] Unclear structure in "a cloak which the old man, when he is at work, ties at the waist with it does not matter what"
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "he becomes heated--enters a caf√© to eat an ice"
- [SPELLING] "seventeen-hundreds" is an unusual phrasing that could be clearer
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "To understand the atmosphere of the France of the seventeen-hundreds before the Revolution it is necessary to understand the art of Watteau, of Boucher, of Fragonard, and of Chardin"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's death to a broader historical analysis of French art without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different time periods and topics with minimal transitional phrases
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is dense with historical analysis that may confuse readers unfamiliar with French art history
- [TRANSITION] The connection between Fragonard's personal story and the broader historical context is not always clearly established
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces new information about other artists (Watteau, Boucher, Chardin) without sufficient context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
