- [GRAMMAR] "he would received no payment"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Hebrew to discussing other ritual languages without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different examples (Welsh, Irish, Church Slavonic, Sanskrit, Geez) without clear organization
- [CLARITY] The comparison between Hebrew and other ritual languages is sometimes confusing in its purpose and focus
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Arthur Davis to broader linguistic and religious themes is abrupt
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Germanism and anti-Semitism seems disconnected from the earlier discussion about Arthur Davis

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
