Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded be done" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "had been weakened; but one element of it--that which is founded on the conviction that goodwill among men is a prime necessity of reasonable living--survives with a certain vigour, though even it has not escaped the general scepticism of the age." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "tug-of-war" is inconsistently written without a hyphen in some contexts  
- [GRAMMAR] "None will denied its lasting virtue." (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "you would created an original festival" (incorrect verb form)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Tree to a satirical alternative festival (shredded wheat, etc.) without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between defending feasting, critiquing excess, and proposing alternatives, with some ideas not clearly connected  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph introduces a new problem (revitalizing the festival) without clearly linking it to the previous discussion  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Chapter Five to Chapter Six is abrupt and lacks a clear connection between the two sections  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
