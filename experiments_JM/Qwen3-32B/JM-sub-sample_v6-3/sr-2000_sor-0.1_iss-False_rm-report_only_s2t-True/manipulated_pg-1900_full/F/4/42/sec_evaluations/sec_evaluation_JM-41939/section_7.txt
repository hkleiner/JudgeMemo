Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "which it take Rosa Bonheur twenty years to bring to completion" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It seemed at that time that the artist would enjoyed her robust old age" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [SPELLING] "tassels" (correct), but minor punctuation issues in some sentences (e.g., missing commas after introductory phrases)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity" (could be smoother)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the description of the painting to the artist's death without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the funeral and public reaction is well-structured but could be more tightly connected to the preceding paragraph  
- [CLARITY] "The concert of regrets which greeted her death" is slightly unclear phrasing, though the meaning is generally clear  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
