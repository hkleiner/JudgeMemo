Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had choose to mark the limits of my survey to-day"  
- [GRAMMAR] "government to made the necessary readjustments"  
- [SPELLING] "saeculum mirabile" (likely a Latin term, but may be distracting for some readers)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (British spelling, but inconsistent with modern usage in some contexts)  
- [SYNTAX] "we are always reaped our past" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Industrial Revolution to picturing the English nation in the 18th century without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between historical examples and broader philosophical ideas without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and may confuse the reader (e.g., "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the discussion of the aristocracy to the loss of America and the impact of the French Revolution
