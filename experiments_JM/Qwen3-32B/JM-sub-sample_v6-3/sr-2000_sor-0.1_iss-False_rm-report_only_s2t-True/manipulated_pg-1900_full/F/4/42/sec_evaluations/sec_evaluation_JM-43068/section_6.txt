- [GRAMMAR] "he so love" should be "he so loved"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The sums that he owe" should be "The sums that he owed"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The prices which Millet obtained... was fantastically small" should be "were fantastically small"  
- [GRAMMAR] "It then passed through several hands before the late Monsieur Secr√©tan competed up to 160,000 francs" is awkward and unclear  
- [GRAMMAR] "Monsieur Proust, acted on behalf of the French Government" should be "Monsieur Proust, acting on behalf of the French Government"  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was leave in the hands of a man" should be "He was left in the hands of a man"  
- [GRAMMAR] "He desire a friend to inquire" should be "He desired a friend to inquire"  
- [GRAMMAR] "and the "Angelus" followed it two years later" should be "and the "Angelus" followed it two years later" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we are told that they presented no features which called for special comment" is awkward and could be clearer  
- [GRAMMAR] "He paid frequent visits to Fontainebleau and the Louvre, and even desire a friend to inquire" is inconsistent in tense  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Millet's financial struggles to the detailed account of the "Angelus" painting's sale history is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing Millet's artistic output to the "Seasons" commission is somewhat disjointed and lacks a smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Millet's contract with speculators and the subsequent legal issues is introduced without sufficient context or explanation  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Millet's later years and the death of Rousseau is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the preceding content  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different aspects of Millet's life (artistic output, financial struggles, personal relationships) without clear transitions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
