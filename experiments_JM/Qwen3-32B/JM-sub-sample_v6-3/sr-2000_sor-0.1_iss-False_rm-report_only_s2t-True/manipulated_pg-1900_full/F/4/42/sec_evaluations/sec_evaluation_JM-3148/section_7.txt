Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "the being who have worn a halo" (incorrect verb form)
- [GRAMMAR] "utter in her own tone" (missing article)
- [GRAMMAR] "the boy has am sick" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SPELLING] "mendacious" (likely a typo for "mendicant" or "mendacious" is contextually odd)
- [GRAMMAR] "wonâ€™t you gave me a trial" (incorrect verb form)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Lyddy's internal thoughts to the dialogue with Anthony Croft without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Lyddy's perspective and the scene with Anthony without clear demarcation
- [CLARITY] The line "But there were no turkeys to be seen" is confusing as it's unclear if this is Lyddy's observation or the narrator's
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Lyddy's realization about Anthony's blindness to the conversation with him is abrupt

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
