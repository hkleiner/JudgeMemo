Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Kuei Ping, hidden beneath the concealing veils, was led forward a few steps by her attendants." (Awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She must lower her eyes to the floor where his dark slippers made a spot of contrast with the bright carpet." (Awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [GRAMMAR] "And Kuei Ping, remembering that Madame Yen had told her that Fuh Tang too have attended a foreign school..." (Subject-verb agreement error: "have" should be "had")  
- [GRAMMAR] "and the evidences of ill ease he had show in the ordeal that had passed" (Incorrect verb form: "show" should be "shown")  
- [GRAMMAR] "She must sit with downcast eyes, her face immovable while the feasting about her went on..." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Still holding her slippers in her hand she listen for sounds of others awake." (Tense inconsistency: "listen" should be "listened")  
- [GRAMMAR] "A wild rose that had clamber up beside the gateway and dared to crossed the bits of broken glass..." (Incorrect verb forms: "clamber" should be "climbed," "crossed" should be "cross")  
- [SPELLING] "Kuei Ping saw Chia Fuh Tang for the first time in one swift steal glance..." (Typo: "steal" should be "steal" or "stole")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the wedding ceremony to Kuei Ping's moonlit walk is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Kuei Ping stepping outside the compound feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about the wedding and its aftermath.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the evidences of ill ease he had show in the ordeal that had passed" is vague and unclear.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final lines "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in Peking" are abruptly separated from the preceding paragraph and disrupt the flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the wedding feast to Kuei Ping's moonlit walk lacks a smooth transition, making the narrative feel disjointed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
