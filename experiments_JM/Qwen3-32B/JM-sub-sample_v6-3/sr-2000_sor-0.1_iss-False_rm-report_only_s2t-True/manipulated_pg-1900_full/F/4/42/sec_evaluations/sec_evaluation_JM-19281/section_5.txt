Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "promulgate" should be "promulgated"  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh" is inconsistently written as "Bahá'u'lláh" and "Bahá'u'lláh" (though this may be stylistic, it is inconsistent)  
- [SYNTAX] "the generality of humankind in this respect has, time and again, condemned entire populations to a ritualistic repetition of ordinances and practices long after these latter have fulfilled their purpose and now merely stultify moral advance" – overly complex and awkward phrasing  
- [LEXICON] "succeeded in arrogating to themselves exclusive control over interpretation of the Divine intent" – "arrogating" is a rare and somewhat archaic word that may confuse some readers  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "In the absence of scriptural texts that established unarguable institutional authority, clerical elites succeeded in arrogating to themselves exclusive control over interpretation of the Divine intent" – could be clearer with additional punctuation  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the discussion of progressive revelation to the critique of theological presumption is abrupt and lacks a clear connecting sentence  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between abstract theological concepts and concrete examples (e.g., the parable of the landowner) without clear signposting, making the flow less smooth  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the scope of what could be achieved, in any age, became increasingly limited by such artificially contrived obstacles" is somewhat vague and could be more clearly explained  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the Qur'án to "the modern mind" is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link  
- [LOGIC] The argument about "conceptions of physical resurrection, a paradise of carnal delights, reincarnation, pantheistic prodigies, and the like" is introduced without sufficient context or explanation of how they relate to the main argument  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
