Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "had been man" instead of "had been manned"
- [GRAMMAR] "had been kill" instead of "had been killed"
- [SPELLING] "avoid" is cut off at the end of the sentence ("avoid.")
- [GRAMMAR] "It was discover at 3 a.m." instead of "It was discovered at 3 a.m."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the capture of Fort Gregg to the Union assault on other points without clear transitional connection
- [STRUCTURE] The timeline of events is sometimes confusing, with multiple simultaneous actions described without clear chronological markers
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the defenders of Fort Gregg put up a stubborn delaying action against the Northern advance" is somewhat ambiguous about what exactly was being delayed
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the battle descriptions to the casualty statistics at the end is abrupt and lacks context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
