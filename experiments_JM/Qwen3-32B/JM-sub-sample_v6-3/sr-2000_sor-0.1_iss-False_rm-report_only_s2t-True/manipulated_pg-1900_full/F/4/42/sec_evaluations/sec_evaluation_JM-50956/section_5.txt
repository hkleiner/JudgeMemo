Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "consist only in the systematic retreat" (should be "consisted")  
- [GRAMMAR] "did not even once succeeded" (should be "succeeded")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Germans, through the efforts of Russia, were finally deprived of any chance of winning in France" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is but natural that the resistance of the Russians in 1915 prevented the Germans from exploiting that success which they regarded as a big one" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Russians, just as on previous occasions, did not hesitate a minute to help her Allies" (inconsistent pronoun usage: "her")  
- [GRAMMAR] "General Brusilov launched it along a front two hundred miles long, with the troops he just happened to have on the spot" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "in the direction of Venice" (missing preposition or article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "General Alexeiev pointed out to the Roumanian High Command the excessive length of the Roumanian frontier line" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Russian Army had not yet succeeded in recuperating from the effects of its great summer offensive of 1916" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "this offer is turned down by the Roumanians with some show of embarrassment" (should be "was turned down")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different events and time periods without clear transitions (e.g., from 1915 to 1916 to the "Salvation of Roumania" chapter).  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on the "Salvation of Roumania" begins abruptly without a clear transition from the previous section.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the Russian Army's actions and the broader war context is sometimes unclear or implied rather than explained.  
- [LOGIC] The text references Ludendorf's memoirs and other sources without clearly establishing their relevance to the argument.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing the 1916 Brusilov offensive to the 1916 Russian offensive in aid of the French is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the "Salvation of Roumania" lacks a clear introduction or context for the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Gurko's 'War and Revolution'" without explaining its relevance or providing a clear citation.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the Russian offensive in aid of the French in March 1916 is disconnected from the broader narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the effects of Brusilov's offensive" on the French front but does not clearly explain the causal link.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the Russian Army's aid to Roumania is introduced abruptly and lacks a clear connection to the previous section.
