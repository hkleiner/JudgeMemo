Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was none too soon. The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe, with bowed head dashed on, Morley on his return beat, came up to the group" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had fainted once that day, God keep him from another attack!" (missing punctuation and awkward structure).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He gave the countersign and dragged on." (vague phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had never known such exhaustion before. A laugh startle him..." (subject-verb agreement error).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was too weary to open his eyes or to care what became of him..." (awkward phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s coming!" he shouted sitting upright in the saddle." (missing comma after "saddle").  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him." (awkward phrasing and redundancy).  
- [SPELLING] "I’mmed all right" (misspelled "I'm").  
- [SPELLING] "to bore the welcome news" (likely should be "to bear").  
- [SPELLING] "bore the news" (title of the chapter is "HOW MOLLY BORE THE NEWS," but the text uses "bore" in the body, which is correct, but the inconsistency may be confusing).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the British camp to the American camp is abrupt and lacks clear explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift in focus from the British men to Shirtliffe's journey to the American camp is jarring.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of "Jack Martin" and the emotional exchange is somewhat disconnected from the main narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The final scene with the firing and the officer approaching feels rushed and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Morley on his return beat, came up to the group" is unclear and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The line "The situation was too much for the three men. In silence they gazed into each other’s faces and grew sick with apprehension" is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [CLARITY] The line "He must make the best of what time and strength he had leave" is awkward and unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The line "He was too young to be trusted far; you’ll get into mischief yet" is confusing in context.  
- [CLARITY] The line "He had wanted to so much!" is vague and lacks clarity.  
- [CLARITY] The line "He was dying among all those men!" is abrupt and lacks context.
