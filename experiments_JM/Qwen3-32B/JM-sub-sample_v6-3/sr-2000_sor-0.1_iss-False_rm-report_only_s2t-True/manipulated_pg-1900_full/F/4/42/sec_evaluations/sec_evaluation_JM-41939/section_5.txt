Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Rosa Bonheur have no sooner withdrawn..." should be "Rosa Bonheur had no sooner withdrawn..."  
- [GRAMMAR] "Certain pictures appear to have been do rapidly..." should be "done rapidly"  
- [GRAMMAR] "At this period, it may be added, everything which came from the artist's brush possessed..." has awkward phrasing  
- [GRAMMAR] "One day a Prussian officer of high rank present himself..." should be "presented himself"  
- [SPELLING] "Relieve of all outside interruption" should be "Relieved of all outside interruption"  
- [SPELLING] "am sent to her by her friend Gambard" should be "were sent"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions (e.g., from the 1867 exposition to the art school in 1849, then back to 1860 and 1865).  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Rosa Bonheur's artistic career to her humanitarian efforts during the war of 1870 without a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final sentence is incomplete and cuts off mid-idea ("One day a Prussian officer of high rank present himself..."), leaving the reader hanging.  
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph about the art school is inserted as a parenthesis, which disrupts the flow of the main narrative.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
