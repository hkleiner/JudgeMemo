Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was shortly after we left Bar-le-Duc that Major C., consoled by my assurance... tell us an amusing story..." (subject-verb agreement error: "tell" should be "told")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he was given a dinner party at headquarters, which, owing to the exigencies of the moment, were in a certain large cellar" (subject-verb agreement error: "were" should be "was")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he had dined at headquarters before, and many of them" (unclear antecedent for "them")  
- [GRAMMAR] "his maître d’hôtel enter and handed him a slip of paper" (tense error: "enter" should be "entered")  
- [GRAMMAR] "as no one in Epernay have the enterprise to send it to a Paris newspaper" (tense error: "have" should be "had")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The German military authorities hesitated to believe that the French Government and military authorities am capable..." ("am" should be "are")  
- [GRAMMAR] "You know now, Frenchmen, that that slave of England, M. Poincaré, will be responsible..." (awkward repetition of "that")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mme. le General Pau and Mme. Waddington, who, as all the world knows, was Mary King of New York" (subject-verb agreement error: "was" should be "were")  
- [GRAMMAR] "On the council was thirty-nine names" (word order error; should be "There were thirty-nine names on the council")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Paris banking house of Munroe & Co. accepted the office of Treasurer and receives all donations" (tense inconsistency: "receives" should be "received")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The document abruptly shifts from a narrative about newsboys and a military anecdote to a detailed list of names and organizational structure, with no clear transition or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression between the anecdotal sections and the formal description of the "Bienêtre du Blessé" organization, making the connection between the two sections unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the "Bienêtre du Blessé" section is not clearly explained in relation to the preceding narrative, leading to confusion about the overall intent of the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about the Bosche letter to the description of the military train is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the author's involvement in the committee is disconnected from the earlier narrative and lacks a clear motivation or context.
