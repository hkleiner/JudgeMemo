1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "From this point on, the Bradley career move into high gear" (subject-verb agreement error)

- [GRAMMAR] "he rejoined the Hearst organization as art and typographic supervisor" (missing article before "art")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he suggested he make new drawings" (inconsistent verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The type ornaments on these pages were draw in 1953 for ATF" (incorrect verb form)  
- [SPELLING] "severest critic" (likely intended as "severest critic," but "severest" is correct; no issue)  
- [SPELLING] "further illumine certain passages" (correct, no issue)  
- [SYNTAX] "he suggested he make new drawings to replace those on chapter pages, which were drawn in 1949 to enhance the solid text pages of the Memories booklet" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Like most Typophile projects, this had been in process for many months" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Our physical limitations and resources proved inadequate to reflect the qualities, and the scope and variety of Mr. Bradley’s work" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions (e.g., from Bradley’s career to the sources of the book)  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the 1954 Portfolio is abruptly introduced without clear connection to the preceding content  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Typophiles project and Peter Beilenson is introduced without clear context or transition  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about illustrations is introduced abruptly and seems disconnected from the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Mr. Bradley offering to rewrite the text is introduced without clear connection to the previous paragraph  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "he suggested he make new drawings to replace those on chapter pages, which were drawn in 1949 to enhance the solid text pages of the Memories booklet" is confusing and lacks clarity  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Our physical limitations and resources proved inadequate to reflect the qualities, and the scope and variety of Mr. Bradley’s work" is unclear and awkwardly phrased  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on Bradley’s career to the section on the book’s sources is abrupt and lacks a clear connection
