2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The transition from Kuei Ping's spiritual awakening to the description of the sunrise feels somewhat disconnected from the immediate narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Kuei Ping's internal thoughts and external observations without clear transitions.
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the poison of the poppy stilled into pleasantness the dreams of Fuh Tang and the poison of selfish despair did its work upon the heart of Kuei Ping" is somewhat ambiguous.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Kuei Ping's preparations for departure to the description of the sunrise lacks a smooth transition.
- [LOGIC] The sudden resolution of Kuei Ping's internal conflict feels somewhat abrupt after the detailed description of her struggles.
