Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The days that followed am filled with deep joy for me." (Subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] "In the atmosphere of her own home Kuei Ping let me know her daughter and her four grandchildren." (Missing punctuation between clauses)  
- [SPELLING] "overladen" (likely a misspelling of "overladen" is correct, but "overloaded" is more commonly used)  
- [LEXICON] "interlacing series of freight trains" (awkward phrasing; "interlacing" is not standard in this context)  
- [SYNTAX] "I wonder just a little at her daring to place it there." (Awkward phrasing; could be smoother)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the temples to the school and church without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the school and church is somewhat disjointed from the preceding description of the temples  
- [CLARITY] "The counting board whose legend reads 'As you live so shall the evils be marked against you'" (unclear reference to "counting board")  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the parents and the children's education feels slightly abrupt after the description of the temples and school  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
