Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "am sent to her by her friend Gambard" (should be "were sent")  
- [GRAMMAR] "present himself at her home" (should be "presented himself")  
- [GRAMMAR] "studied the big cats" (should be "studying")  
- [GRAMMAR] "to understood" (should be "to understand")  
- [GRAMMAR] "This loss break my heart" (should be "broke")  
- [SPELLING] "panthers" (should be "panthers" is correct, but "panther" is more standard in English)  
- [SPELLING] "By" (used as a place name, but unclear if it is a typo or intentional)  
- [SPELLING] "Mlle. Micas" (correct, but inconsistent capitalization in some contexts)  
- [SPELLING] "M. Roger Mil√®s" (correct, but "M." is French for "Monsieur," which may be confusing to English readers)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "She noted them down with rapid and unfaltering pencil; the painting of the picture after this was a mere matter of execution."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Rosa Bonheur's refusal of favours to her work on big cats with little transitional explanation  
- [LOGIC] Jump from the description of her paintings to the death of Mlle. Micas with no clear connection  
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of President Carnot and decorations without clear narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] Transition from her melancholy to the arrival of Miss Anna Klumpke is abrupt  
- [LOGIC] Jump from her friendship with Miss Klumpke to the painting "The Duel" is not clearly connected  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense, with many subtopics introduced without clear organization or transitions  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as "The artist has admirably expressed this difference in a foreshortening of the head which Correggio or Veronese might have envied her."
