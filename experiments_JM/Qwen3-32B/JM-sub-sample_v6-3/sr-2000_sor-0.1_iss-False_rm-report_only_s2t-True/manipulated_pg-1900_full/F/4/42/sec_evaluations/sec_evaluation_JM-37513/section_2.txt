Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "to have take a definite" (should be "taken")  
- [GRAMMAR] "shoulded be laid elsewhere" (should be "should be")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I must left to some future..." (should be "I must leave")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I would fain left it altogether..." (should be "I would fain leave it")  
- [GRAMMAR] "we are refer back to the first..." (should be "referred back")  
- [GRAMMAR] "we have pushed our explorations of the first to its uttermost limit" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In asserted it we assert..." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the question is for science (or should I say for those who accept this delimitation of the province of science?) not so much unanswerable in any terms, as unanswerable in scientific terms." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "wellnigh" (should be "well-nigh")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is often a synonym for cause; it stands alike for matter and energy; it is the objective correlate of our subjective sense of effort." (repetitive and awkward structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "From this flows all necessity whether in things or thoughts or any combination of the two." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the "Unknowable" is repeated and rephrased in a way that lacks progression or resolution.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph structure is dense and lacks clear segmentation, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "force" is used in multiple, ambiguous ways without clarification, leading to confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the role of science is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph introduces a new line of reasoning without clearly linking it to the previous discussion.
