Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "if he imagines that the evolutionary movement in Judaism proceeds regularly from Abraham to Isaiah, he is grossly in error." (missing comma after "if")  
- [GRAMMAR] "But even in the crudities of Genesis or Judges that have escaped editorship I cannot find Mr. Wells's 'malignant' Deity..." (missing comma after "Judges")  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the same chapter, the people having made a golden calf, Moses offers his life for their sin;" (awkward phrasing, missing comma after "calf")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the anonymous New Year liturgist celebrates as:" (missing article before "Lord of Infinity!")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the orthodox Jew hardly regards his Hebrew text as complete unless accompanied by the Aramaic version popularly ascribed to the proselyte Onkelos." (missing "it is" before "accompanied")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the disagreeable references to proselytes in Rabbinic literature, the difficulties thrown in their way, and the grotesque conception of their status towards their former families," (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the comparatively modern Chassidism, anticipating Mazzini, teaches that every nation and language has a special channel through which it receives God's gifts." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The forces of democracy was Israel," (subject-verb agreement error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between multiple historical and philosophical references without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the central argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph is overly long and dense, with multiple subtopics introduced and abandoned without clear organization.  
- [CLARITY] Some references (e.g., "the anonymous New Year liturgist") are unclear without additional context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the God of Abraham to the God of Maimonides and then to modern Reform Judaism is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the "tribal God" is occasionally undermined by the sheer number of references, making the central thesis less focused.  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic or poetic language (e.g., "medi√¶val," "proselytised") may confuse modern readers.
