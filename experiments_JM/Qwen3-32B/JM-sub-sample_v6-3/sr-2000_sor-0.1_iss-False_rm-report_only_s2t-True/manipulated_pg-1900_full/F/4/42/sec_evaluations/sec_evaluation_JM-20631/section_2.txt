Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had not make a breach" should be "had not made a breach"  
- [GRAMMAR] "it would not follow that Judaism had not silently replaced him by a nobler Deity centuries ago" has awkward phrasing and unclear structure  
- [SPELLING] "Jochanan ben Zaccai" is inconsistently capitalized  
- [SPELLING] "am the Jehovah" should be "among the Jehovah"  
- [SYNTAX] "its confusion of voices, is an index of free thinking" has a misplaced comma and awkward phrasing  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Hebrew ritual to Maimonides and then to post-biblical thinkers is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical periods and concepts without clear signposting or logical progression  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is dense and difficult to follow, with complex ideas presented in a confusing order  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the Talmud to the evolution of Jewish thought lacks smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the "ogre of popular imagination" and the replacement of the deity is not clearly explained or supported  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
