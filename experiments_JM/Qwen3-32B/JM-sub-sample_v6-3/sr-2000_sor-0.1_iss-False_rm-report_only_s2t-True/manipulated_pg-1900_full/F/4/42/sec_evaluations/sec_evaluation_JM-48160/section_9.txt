Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "If they was grand blessés" should be "If they are grand blessés"  
- [GRAMMAR] "to said the least of it" should be "to say the least of it"  
- [SPELLING] "indefatigable taube" should be "indefatigable taube" (likely correct, but "taube" is a rare term and may be misused)  
- [GRAMMAR] "One of the many infirmières majors with whom I talked tell me" should be "told me"  
- [GRAMMAR] "there had never been a war on such a scale as this, and it is the first time the authorities... have been confronted with a new problem" – inconsistent tense usage  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the bathtubs to the discussion of hospital kitchens is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The term "Réformé Numero II" is not explained, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with French military terminology  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between descriptive accounts of hospitals and broader commentary on military discipline and French economy, which can disrupt the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about pillows is introduced abruptly and feels disconnected from the preceding discussion  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
