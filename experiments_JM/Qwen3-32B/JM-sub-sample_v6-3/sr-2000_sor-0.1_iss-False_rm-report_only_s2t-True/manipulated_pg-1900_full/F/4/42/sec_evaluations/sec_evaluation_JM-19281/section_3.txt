Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had any of the leading arbiters of world affairs addressed by Bahá'u'lláh spared time for reflection on a conception of reality supported by the moral credentials of its Author, moral credentials of the kind they professed to hold in the highest regard." (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the shout hathed been raised" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the souls have been quicken in the tombs of their bodies" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "No other force in existence has am able to elicit from people comparable qualities..." (incorrect word order)  
- [GRAMMAR] "earnest attempts are was made" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "With grew confidence and growing success, women justly insist..." (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the guidance require to lived with modernity" (incorrect verb form)

- [GRAMMAR] "in the mould create by its authoritative scripture" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Bahá'ís will have to gained an in-depth understanding" (incorrect verb form)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical ideas and concrete examples without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the failure of traditional religions to adapt to modernity is presented but not clearly connected to the broader context of Bahá'u'lláh's message.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as the one beginning with "It is impossible to imagine how different the history..."  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the spiritual crisis to the role of religions in history is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the artificiality of the world order is introduced but not fully explained or supported with sufficient reasoning.
