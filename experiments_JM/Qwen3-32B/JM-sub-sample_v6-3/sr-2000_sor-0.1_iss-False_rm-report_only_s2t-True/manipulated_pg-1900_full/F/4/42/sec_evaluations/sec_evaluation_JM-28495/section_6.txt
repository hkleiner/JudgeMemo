Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Finally, when the luggage is all cleared out, the guard take off Excalibur's chain..."
- [GRAMMAR] "failed to recognized their own property"
- [GRAMMAR] "had with the aid of the commissionaire extracted Excalibur from underneath..."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the curate's departure to a coroner's jury and train accident without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly ends with "You must output only and exactly the following format:" which appears to be a formatting instruction rather than part of the narrative
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps from Eileen's departure to a train accident without sufficient transition or explanation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
