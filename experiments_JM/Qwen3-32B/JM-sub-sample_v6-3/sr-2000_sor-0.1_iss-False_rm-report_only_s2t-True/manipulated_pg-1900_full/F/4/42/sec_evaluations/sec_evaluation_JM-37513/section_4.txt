Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "express the hope 'that the science of the future will discard the use of cause and effect as formally obscure'" (missing "had" before "express")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Such views may, perhaps, was regarded as extreme" (incorrect verb tense; should be "be regarded")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the kinds of change was also so many!" (subject-verb agreement error; should be "were")  
- [GRAMMAR] "we need to name it in some way; and this is the way that is, rather unfortunately, sanctioned by custom and long usage" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the term relatedness woulded suffice" (typo; should be "would")  
- [SPELLING] "smudgy" (uncommon and possibly incorrect word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "duties in every conceivable connexion?" (British spelling "connexion" is acceptable but inconsistent with the rest of the text)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is complex and dense, with multiple nested ideas that are difficult to follow without prior context.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly convoluted and lack clarity, such as "the relational constitution of the system being what it is, the changes are what they are!"  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Spencer to modern scientific interpretations of energy is abrupt and lacks a clear bridge.  
- [LOGIC] The use of "Source" as a substitute for "cause" is introduced but not consistently explained or justified in a way that is accessible to the reader.
