- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between historical events with minimal explanation or connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense with historical details but lacks clear organization or thematic progression

- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs, especially between the cathedral construction and the events leading to Becket's murder  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Dean Stanley's 'Historical Memorials of Canterbury'" is mentioned but not elaborated, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the source
