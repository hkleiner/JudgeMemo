- [GRAMMAR] "had am published"  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded tax"  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Tower resign"

- [GRAMMAR] "we could made the date"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The intervening time" (misspelled as "intervened time")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the Hearst projects to the anecdote about the Blackstone Hotel without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Spoils, a drama in verse, and Launcelot and the Ladies, a novel" is unclear in its placement and relevance to the surrounding text  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Hearst International changes to the Cosmopolitan headings in 1923 is abrupt and lacks context
