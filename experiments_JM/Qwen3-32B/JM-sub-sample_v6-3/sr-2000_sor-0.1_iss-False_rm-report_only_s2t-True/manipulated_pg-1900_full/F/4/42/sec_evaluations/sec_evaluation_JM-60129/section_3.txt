Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "tshokh" (likely a typo or non-standard term)  
- [SPELLING] "illnes" (misspelled; should be "illness")  
- [SPELLING] "contrarys" (misspelled; should be "contrary")  
- [SPELLING] "prepare" (misspelled; should be "prepared")  
- [GRAMMAR] "A young man or maiden dying after a short illnes was simply buried..." (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Cousins was forbidden to marry..." (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "if the marriage has already take place..." (tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the bride and bridegroom are not allowed to see each other before marriage." (missing article; should be "the bride and the bridegroom")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the navel string is severed with a pair of scissors by an old woman, often the grandmother of the child." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The number of deaths still outnumber the births." (subject-verb agreement issue)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of physical appearance to customs and then to marriage and funeral practices, with minimal transitional phrases.  
- [LOGIC] The section on statistics is introduced suddenly after a detailed description of cultural practices, with no clear connection or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "tshokh" is unclear and not defined, which may confuse the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the statistics being potentially falsified is introduced without sufficient context or explanation of why this might be the case.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the Sarö Yögurs' language to the statistical table is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
