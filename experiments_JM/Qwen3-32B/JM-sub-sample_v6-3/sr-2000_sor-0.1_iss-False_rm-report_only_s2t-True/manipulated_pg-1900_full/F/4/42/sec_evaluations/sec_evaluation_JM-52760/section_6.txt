Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The columns made rapid progress, driving the enemy outposts ahead of them and advancing until they neared Burgess’ Mill where the Boydton Plank Road cross Hatcher’s Run." (subject-verb agreement error: "cross" should be "crosses" or "crossed")  
- [SPELLING] "The failure of Union Generals Hancock of the II Corps and Warren of the V Corps to coordinate the efforts of their respective columns..." (missing comma after "Hancock")  
- [SYNTAX] "The slackening of hostile action was used to good advantage by Union and Confederated alike..." (awkward phrasing; "Confederated" is incorrect; should be "Confederates")  
- [LEXICON] "The enlisted men of both armies, however, remained largely unaware of the strategy of their commanders." (repetition of "strategy" is not an issue, but the sentence is slightly awkward in flow)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The only Federal units to reach the Boydton Plank Road belonged to the cavalry, but in view of the Confederate response and the discovery that General Lee was not utilizing this road to supply his army, they were recalled." (long sentence with multiple clauses; could be clearer with additional punctuation or restructuring)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed battle descriptions and broader strategic overviews without clear transitions, making the narrative flow uneven.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the "special artists" is abruptly introduced and feels disconnected from the preceding and following content.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Confederated" instead of "Confederates" introduces confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Battle of Hatcher’s Run to the broader description of soldier life lacks a smooth transition, making the connection between the two sections unclear.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the "special artists" is not clearly linked to the rest of the text, creating a disjointed impression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
