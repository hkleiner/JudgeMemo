- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Millet's personal life and his artistic development without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as "the struggle betwixt reaction and property on the one hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged with grim determination"  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Millet's time in Paris to his move to Barbizon is abrupt and lacks explanation
