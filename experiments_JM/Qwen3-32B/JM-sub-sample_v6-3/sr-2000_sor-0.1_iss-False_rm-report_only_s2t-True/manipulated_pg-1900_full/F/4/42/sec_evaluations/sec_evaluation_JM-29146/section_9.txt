Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The costume she have worn" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey have ever been vouchsafed" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [SPELLING] "insulined" (likely a typo for "insulated")  
- [GRAMMAR] "run after Margot" (subject-verb agreement issue; should be "ran")  
- [GRAMMAR] "hadn't reach it yet" (incorrect tense; should be "hadn't reached")  
- [GRAMMAR] "died" (used in a context that contradicts the established rules of the world, but this is a narrative choice, not a grammatical error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Confusion about the rules of the "timeless world" (e.g., characters can die from lack of air, which contradicts earlier statements)  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in Vardin's character from timid to strong without clear motivation  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the fog was lifting" when it is stated that the fog was not lifting  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden introduction of new characters (the five space-suited figures) without clear setup or explanation  
- [LOGIC] Confusing implications about the rules of the world (e.g., death is possible, but earlier it was stated that time is necessary for death)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the mystical vision to the physical confrontation  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
