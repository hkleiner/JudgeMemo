1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "may perhaps was taken for granted" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we should was content to say" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we do see, as far as science ever professes to see, 'how the two are related.'" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "in a certain indirect way quantitive" (misspelling of "quantitative")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the rest of the whole other than the specific part" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "stated the problem in such a form as to bring it within the purview of science" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "he is a parent of the future; and his thoughts are as children born to him, which he may not carelessly let die." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "gravitative knowledge is reciprocal" (confusing analogy between gravitational and cognitive knowledge)  
- [LOGIC] "the part knows the whole in a way that the whole does not know the part" (confusing and abstract concept without clear explanation)  
- [LOGIC] "cognitive relatedness is effective" (vague and abstract concept without clear connection to the argument)  
- [LOGIC] "the 'sum of energy' presumably remains constant" (sudden shift to physical science without clear relevance to the main argument)  
- [LOGIC] "to invoke an immaterial psychic entity... appears to me quite unwarranted" (sudden shift in tone and argument without clear transition)  
- [LOGIC] "But where Spencer failed, who had come within measurable sight of success?" (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)  
- [LOGIC] "we are only just beginning to see our way to stated the problem" (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)
