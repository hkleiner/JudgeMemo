Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "One would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake should conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and took on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the proper development of the city's shipping." (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we descend the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped at opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below." (tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The women wore a sort of low-necked body with great wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the same size at both bottom and top..." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the upper end not being belt or tied, but just drawn tightly around the waist..." (missing preposition and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung loosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads of hair that almost any lady woulded be proud to own." (incorrect past tense "woulded")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Many of the women had in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied with small white threads to held them together..." (incorrect verb form "to held")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from the voyage to the description of the women in Manila without a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the women's clothing and appearance feels disconnected from the broader narrative of the voyage and arrival in Manila.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about the women chewing cigars is confusing and lacks context or explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the Bishop Museum to the mention of the International Date Line and the "Revels of Neptune" is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Century Magazine for September, 1889" is inserted without explanation or relevance to the surrounding narrative.
