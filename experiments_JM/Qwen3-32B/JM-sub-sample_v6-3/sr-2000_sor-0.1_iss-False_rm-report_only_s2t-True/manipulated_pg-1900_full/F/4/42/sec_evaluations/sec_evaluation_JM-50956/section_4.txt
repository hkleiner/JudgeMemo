Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had been the main objective of Ludendorf's offensive" should be "had been the main objective of Ludendorff's offensive" (misspelling of "Ludendorff").  
- [GRAMMAR] "there would had been no sense" should be "there would have been no sense."  
- [GRAMMAR] "Not one single German operation in France coulded obtain full development" should be "could obtain full development."  
- [SPELLING] "oblige" should be "obliged."  
- [SPELLING] "avert" should be "averted."  
- [SPELLING] "Kitchener's stupendous plan of expanding the small, 150 thousand-strong English Army of volunteers into the four million-strong Army of the English nation in arms" has inconsistent hyphenation and phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "If we take into consideration all the Russian theatres of war, including those in Asia, the enemy kept on the Russian fronts 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions,--altogether 192 divisions (in May, 1917) while on the Anglo-French front the enemy had in May, 1917, only 142 divisions." – awkward phrasing and punctuation.  
- [SYNTAX] "Who knows what might had been the result of the German offensive in France had those German reserves which perished in Russia broken through somewhere in the north of France simultaneously with the storming of Verdun, in February." – grammatically incorrect and overly complex.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text references "diagrams No. 3,4" which are not provided, making it unclear what the diagrams illustrate and how they support the argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical events and interpretations without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is repetitive in emphasizing the role of the Russian front in diverting German forces, but the repetition is not always clearly connected to new points.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the Russian front in 1915 to the German memoirs and internal disputes (e.g., between Ludendorf and Falkenhayn) is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The text makes strong claims about the German failure in 1915 based on Ludendorf’s memoirs, but does not provide sufficient evidence or context to support these interpretations.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the true ally, Russia, certainly aided by diverting upon herself all the German reserves in 1915 and giving the Allies a whole year of respite in which to create new armed forces" is somewhat ambiguous in its structure and could be clearer.
