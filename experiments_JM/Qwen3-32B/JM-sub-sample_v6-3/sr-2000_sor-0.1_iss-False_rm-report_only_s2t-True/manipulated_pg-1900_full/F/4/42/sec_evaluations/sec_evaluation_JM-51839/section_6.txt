Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "build in 1716" should be "built in 1716"  
- [GRAMMAR] "this mission was move to San Antonio" should be "this mission was moved to San Antonio"  
- [GRAMMAR] "this mission was also removed to San Antonio, where it was called San Juan Capistrano" (awkward phrasing and missing verb)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The sites of the presidio and missions have am appropriately marked by the State of Texas" (incorrect word order and use of "am")  
- [GRAMMAR] "One of the members of Nolan’s expedition; was captured by Lieut. Musquiz..." (incorrect punctuation and sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mark by the State of Texas" (missing verb)  
- [GRAMMAR] "E. E. Hamilton, Capt. Hayden Arnold." (incomplete sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The graves of the following veterans of the Battle of San Jacinto have also been marked: E. E." (sentence cut off)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Only negro to be honored by the State of Texas with a Centennial marker." (missing article and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Given to the city of Nacogdoches by the Griffith heirs in memory of Dr. L. E. Griffith and his wife, Sarah Jane Clark Griffith, and Dr. Griffith’s brother, Alfred." (awkward phrasing and missing verb)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the Old Stone Fort to the Missions and Presidio without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on the Missions and Presidio is followed by unrelated segments about the Stage Stand, Father Margil, Peter Ellis Bean, Oak Grove Cemetery, William Goyens, Griffith Park, and Indian Mounds, with no clear organization or logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The text references historical events and people without sufficient context or explanation, making it difficult to follow for a general reader.  
- [LOGIC] The section on Peter Ellis Bean is cut off mid-sentence and lacks a clear connection to the rest of the text.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the graves of Texas independence signers is followed by a brief mention of William Goyens, which is not clearly connected to the previous section.  
- [LOGIC] The final section on Indian Mounds is disconnected from the rest of the text and lacks a clear transition.
