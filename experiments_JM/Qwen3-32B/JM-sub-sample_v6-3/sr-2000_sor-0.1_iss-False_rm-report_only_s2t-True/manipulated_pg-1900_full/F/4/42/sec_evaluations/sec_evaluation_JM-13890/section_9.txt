Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "it is never possible to see it" is slightly awkward and could be phrased more clearly.  
- [SYNTAX] "the only one lacking in interest is All Saints' in High Street" is grammatically correct but could be smoother.  
- [LEXICON] "one must be content with the picturesque brick gateway" is slightly wordy and could be more concise.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the hospitals and the churches is abrupt and lacks a clear connecting phrase.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the head of Sir Thomas More" is introduced without prior context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the reference.  
- [CLARITY] The final sentence about the Roper house feels disconnected from the previous sentence about St. Dunstan's, creating a minor coherence issue.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
