- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the story of Grey Friars Bobby to the visit to Melrose Abbey with little transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear signposting or logical flow  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Don by this time was as much interested..." is slightly confusing in context  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the story of the Border Clans to the arrival at Melrose Abbey is abrupt  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Skylemore and "Rob Roy" feels disconnected from the previous section about Abbotsford and Dryburgh Abbey
