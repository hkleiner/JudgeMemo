Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "it should was told"  
- [GRAMMAR] "I woulded be given his office"  
- [GRAMMAR] "has been under circumstances quite exceptional" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "would classify that Thanksgiving number as a newsstand disappointment" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Collier’ssed"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the author's work on Collier’s to a reflection on salesmanship and lessons learned, with little transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., from Collier’s to the author’s early experiences) without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is confusing in its logic, especially the sentence about the Thanksgiving number being a "newsstand disappointment" despite earlier praise  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the chapters and sections, especially between the "Magazine World" chapters and the Collier’s section  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
