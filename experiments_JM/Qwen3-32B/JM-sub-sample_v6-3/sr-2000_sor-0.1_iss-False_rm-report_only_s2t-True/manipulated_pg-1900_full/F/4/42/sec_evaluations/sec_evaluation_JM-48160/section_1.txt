Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "you can come and go almost as freely as before the war. All that is necessary is a sauf conduit easily obtained..." (missing article before "sauf conduit")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would provided me with the necessary letters" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Alas, if it am only a month earlier" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Grand Quartier Générale would never consented" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "wound ways of Le Ministère de la Guerre" (likely a typo for "winding ways")  
- [SPELLING] "taubes" (likely a typo for "taubes" is correct, but contextually unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "I made no attempt to enter this proscribed region for six or seven weeks after my arrival, having the thousand and one phases of woman’s work in the war to examine."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the author's personal experiences and broader descriptions of the war zone without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The author's frustration with the process of obtaining permission is clear, but the connection between her efforts and the final outcome is not always logically presented.  
- [CLARITY] Some references to French institutions and procedures are unclear to a general reader unfamiliar with the context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the author's personal journey to the description of the battlefield at Meaux is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
