2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator's printing business to a Christmas magazine cover design without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] Jump from the narrator's business struggles to a detailed description of New York in the 1890s without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The narrative abruptly shifts from the narrator's personal story to a fictionalized "you" in the New York section  
- [LOGIC] The New York section reads like a separate vignette with little connection to the previous business narrative  
- [LOGIC] The transition to "CHAPTER: INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" is abrupt and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The New York section introduces a new character ("you") without clear connection to the narrator  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts from the narrator's business failure to a fictionalized visit to Scribner's with little explanation  
- [LOGIC] The ending with Richard Harding Davis feels disconnected from the rest of the business narrative
