Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I do not wish to give the impression, however, that all the janitors with whom I have worked have been efficient, but I do wished to say..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I am not sure but that the raise in salary please me more than it did him." (incorrect verb form "please" instead of "pleased")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the books and supplies were listed, record, and put into place." (incorrect verb form "record" instead of "recorded")  
- [SPELLING] "co√∂peration" (non-standard spelling; should be "cooperation")  
- [SPELLING] "janitor's duties" (inconsistent spelling of "janitor" in some instances)  
- [SYNTAX] "I do not wish to give the impression, however, that all the janitors with whom I have worked have been efficient, but I do wished to say..." (awkward phrasing and inconsistency in tense)  
- [LEXICON] "I do not know when I have received greater value for the time spent." (awkward phrasing; could be clearer)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the janitor's story to the chapter on "How the Principal Can Help the Teacher" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The shift from a narrative about the janitor to a statistical breakdown of teacher responses is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [CLARITY] The section on the course of study and the problem/project methods is somewhat dense and could benefit from clearer organization.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the janitor's story to the questionnaire results is not clearly explained, making the connection between the two sections unclear.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the "exceptional child" is somewhat disjointed, with ideas presented in a way that is not always logically connected.
