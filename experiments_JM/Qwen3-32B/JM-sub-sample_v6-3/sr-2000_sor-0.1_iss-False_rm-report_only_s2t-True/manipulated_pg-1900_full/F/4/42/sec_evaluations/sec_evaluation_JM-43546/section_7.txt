Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The next day." should be "the next day" without the article "the" after "was to was".  
- [GRAMMAR] "Marjorie was delighted, for she have so often admired..." should be "she had".  
- [GRAMMAR] "which is the kind generally wear by the shepherds" should be "worn by".  
- [GRAMMAR] "who always among themselves spoke the old Gaelic tongue" should be "who always spoke among themselves".  
- [GRAMMAR] "you might believe, before everything was arranged" is awkward phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The next day." is confusing and lacks context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the description of the village to the story of "Auld Wullie" is abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "you might believe, before everything was arranged" is unclear and disrupts the flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the fancy-dress party to Marjorie's costume is not clearly connected to the previous paragraph.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
