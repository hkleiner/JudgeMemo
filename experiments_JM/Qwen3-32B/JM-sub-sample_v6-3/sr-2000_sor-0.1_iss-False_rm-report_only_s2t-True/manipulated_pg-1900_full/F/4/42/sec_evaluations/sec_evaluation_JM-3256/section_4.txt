1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The bookman has indeed no trouble arranging his gossips in his mind, where they hold good fellowship, but he is careful to keep them apart upon his bookshelves" – awkward phrasing and unclear structure.  
- [SYNTAX] "When he comes home after an absence and finds his study has been tidied, which in the feminine mind means putting things in order, and to the bookman general anarchy (it was the real reason Eve was put out of Eden)" – run-on sentence with unclear logic.  
- [SPELLING] "he had been the friend of your boyhood" – missing article ("a").  
- [SYNTAX] "It is days before five shelves are reconstructed, days of unmixed delight, a perpetual whirl of gaiety, as if one had been at a conversazione, where all kinds of famous people whom you had known afar had been gathered together and you had speak to each as if he had been the friend of your boyhood" – run-on sentence with grammatical inconsistency ("you had speak").  
- [GRAMMAR] "When the bookman reads the various suggestions for a holiday which are encouraged in the daily newspapers for commercial purposes about the month of July" – awkward phrasing and wordiness.  
- [SPELLING] "he had been the friend of your boyhood" – missing article.  
- [GRAMMAR] "he would dare to invite Cosmo Medici, who was as keen about books as he was about commerce, and according to Gibbon used to imported Indian spices and Greek books by the same vessel" – incorrect verb form ("imported" should be "import").  
- [GRAMMAR] "and that admirable Bishop of Durham who was as joyful on reaching Paris as the Jewish pilgrim was when he went to Sion, because of the books that were there" – awkward phrasing and unclear structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "O Bless God of Gods, what a rush of the glow of Pleasure rejoiced our hearts" – awkward phrasing and inconsistent capitalization.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mary have a fine collection of books well chosen and beautifully bound" – subject-verb agreement error ("have" should be "has").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from literary analysis to a detailed description of book arranging and then to historical figures and their book collections, with little clear connection between these ideas.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the bookman's rearranging of books is long and meandering, with no clear progression or focus.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of Jeanie Deans to the bookman's hobby is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link.  
- [CLARITY] The passage about the bookman's ideal holiday is vague and lacks a clear focus, making it difficult to follow the author's intent.  
- [LOGIC] The list of historical book collectors is presented without a clear purpose or connection to the broader theme of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure or organization, with ideas introduced and abandoned without resolution.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to Mary Queen of Scots and her library appears out of context and is not clearly connected to the preceding or following content.  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of books as friends and the "conversazione" is not clearly explained or developed.  
- [LOGIC] The text moves from literary analysis to personal anecdotes and historical references without a clear narrative thread.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Mary Queen of Scots feels disconnected from the rest of the text and lacks a clear purpose.
