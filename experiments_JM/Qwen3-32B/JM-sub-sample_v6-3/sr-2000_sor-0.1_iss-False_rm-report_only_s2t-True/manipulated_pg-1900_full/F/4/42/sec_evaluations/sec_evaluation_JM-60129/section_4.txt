Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "conple" instead of "couple"  
- [GRAMMAR] "make a start" should be "made a start" to match past tense  
- [GRAMMAR] "0,5 m" should be "0.5 m" for correct decimal formatting  
- [GRAMMAR] "As he did not arrive by the following evening. I was forced..." – sentence fragment  
- [GRAMMAR] "if it had am icy" should be "if it had been icy"  
- [GRAMMAR] "clift" should be "cliff"  
- [GRAMMAR] "crept" should be "crept" (correct), but "climb a clift" is inconsistent with "crept like snakes"  
- [SPELLING] "Firtrees" should be "Fir trees"  
- [GRAMMAR] "we were suddenly arrived at our destination" – awkward phrasing; should be "we suddenly arrived at our destination"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the description of the journey to the arrival at the monastery without a smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The description of the terrain and the journey is detailed but lacks a clear progression in some parts, making it hard to follow the route  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the promised escort" is confusing without prior context about the escort's role and expectations  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the journey through the ravine to the description of the monastery is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the "decorated white conical towers" is introduced without prior reference to Buddhist architecture in the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
