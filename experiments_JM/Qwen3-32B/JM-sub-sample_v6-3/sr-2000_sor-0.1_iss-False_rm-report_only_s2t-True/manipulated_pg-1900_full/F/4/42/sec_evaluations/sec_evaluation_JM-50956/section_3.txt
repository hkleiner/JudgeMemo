Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Germans and Falkenhayn had figure" (incorrect verb form)  
- [SPELLING] "have compelled them to have 43 divisions in the field, that is, to treble their forces..." (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [SYNTAX] "If the firmness of the Allies hold back the Germans at Ypres..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [LEXICON] "the Russians have compelled them to have 43 divisions in the field..." (incorrect tense usage)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "But not in this alone was the role of Russia apparent in the trying days of October and November, 1914."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the battle of Warsaw to broader strategic implications without clear transitions  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of the same argument about Russian contributions without clear progression  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "Ludendorf's own story" and "Ludendorf's account" without clear context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the battle of Warsaw to the broader year of 1915 without a clear bridge  
- [LOGIC] Overuse of "Ludendorf says" without sufficient explanation of how these statements support the author's argument
