Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "business that is do here" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "lucky enough to brought back the cup" (incorrect verb form)  
- [SPELLING] "Scotch cousins" (potentially outdated or incorrect term depending on context)  
- [SYNTAX] "Early one morning find our party gathered..." (awkward phrasing; should be "Early one morning we find our party gathered...")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "So many little cousins are waiting..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the cruise to a "fine summer" and American cousins without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The ending feels abrupt and disconnected from the preceding narrative  
- [CLARITY] "That was the time, too, when Donald and Sandy got left behind..." introduces a new event without sufficient context  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the cruise and the yacht trip with American cousins  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
