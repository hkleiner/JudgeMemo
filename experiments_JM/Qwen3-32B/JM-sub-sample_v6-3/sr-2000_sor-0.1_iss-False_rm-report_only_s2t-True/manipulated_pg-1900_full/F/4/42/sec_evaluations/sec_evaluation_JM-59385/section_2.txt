- [LOGIC] The transition from the memory of the school to the wedding ceremony is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between past and present tense without clear markers, causing confusion  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia" is an odd, fragmented interjection that disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the wedding preparations to the earlier memory of the soothsayers and the engagement process is jarring and lacks smooth transition
