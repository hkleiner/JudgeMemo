Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "This was true enough, except that when Eileen said 'in' she meant 'up.'" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was a reasonable man and knew that ladies did not wear pockets." (sudden shift in tone and unclear logic)  
- [SPELLING] "Eileen let went of Excalibur's collar." (incorrect verb form)  
- [LEXICON] "Its tail waved menacingly from side to side; its great limbs were bent as though for a spring." (somewhat redundant phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The tramp's sudden shift from threatening to affable is abrupt and lacks clear motivation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the tramp's request to Eileen's return with the dog is somewhat jarring.  
- [CLARITY] The line "This was true enough, except that when Eileen said 'in' she meant 'up.'" is confusing and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the tramp's dialogue to the description of the dog lacks smooth connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
