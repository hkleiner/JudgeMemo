Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers, notably by Carlo Ridolfi." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The correct date is now verified by the discovery, in San Samuele of Venice, Veronese's parish church, of the register of deaths wherein the decease of the great painter is entered as having occurred the 19th of April, 1588, the very day when he completed his sixtieth year." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Paolo Caliari belong to a family of artists." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He applied himself to learn to paint with so much zeal and imagination that his father made no attempt to check his inclination, but entrusted him to Badile." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter is Veronese's real teacher, though not the only one, for young 'Paolino' also attended the studio of another Veronese painter, Giovanni Carotto." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "At an age when young folk have not usually begin to form dreams of the future, young Caliari had already forced himself upon the attention of Verona..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The affectionate patronage of his uncle Badile greatly facilitated his d√©but." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He painted the saintly anchorite defended himself against the blows which the Devil is dealing him with a stick and repulsing the advances of a woman who has been raised up from hell itself to tempt him." (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had a boyhood friend, Battista Zelotti, a painter like himself, and also like himself tormented by dreams of glory." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Here they had the good luck to meet a man of discrimination, in the person of the paymaster-general Portesco, who entrust them with the decoration of his palace." (subject-verb agreement error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from Veronese's early life in Verona to his work in Mantua without a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative is occasionally disjointed, especially in the section about the competition in Mantua, where the sequence of events is not clearly explained.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence about the discovery of the death register is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Veronese's early training to his first major commission is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The description of Veronese's early works and their reception is somewhat confusing due to the lack of a clear chronological structure.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
