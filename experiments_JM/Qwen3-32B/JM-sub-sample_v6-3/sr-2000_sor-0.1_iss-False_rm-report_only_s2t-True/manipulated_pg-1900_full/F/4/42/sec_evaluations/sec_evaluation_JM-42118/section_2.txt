Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honoré, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and this time he is not sent away." (inconsistent tense with previous narrative)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the artist shoulded work over it sufficiently to sign his name upon it--the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' to guide him; the weavers working from the enlargement." (awkward syntax and unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Boucher was give a studio and apartments at the Louvre." (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and am meted out to such as attempted the part of regicide." (incorrect subject-verb agreement)  
- [GRAMMAR] "to be affected creatively by them." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "in an endeavour to uttered his art in halting Italian." (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and evaded the swamping of his own genius in an endeavour to uttered his art in halting Italian." (repetition of similar grammatical error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and the French utterance of his master Boucher called back his dazed wits to the accents of France." (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Fragonard's artistic development to political events (Damiens' assassination) without clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Fragonard's time in Rome to his friendship with Hubert Robert and the Abbé de Saint-Non is abrupt and lacks clear progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about tapestry production is overly detailed and disrupts the flow of the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The explanation of the tapestry-making process is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Fragonard's time in Rome to his return to France is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative thread.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the "bright colours of Italy" and their influence on Fragonard's art is somewhat disconnected from the preceding paragraph about his struggles in Rome.
