1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "was choose as the means"  
- [GRAMMAR] "is enabled to maintain only =140 divisions="  
- [GRAMMAR] "am no longer fit for service"  
- [GRAMMAR] "who were discharge entirely"  
- [SPELLING] "Germano-Bolshevist" (likely correct but may be inconsistent with modern spelling conventions)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "=162 divisions=" (unnecessary punctuation)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "=140 divisions=" (unnecessary punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "adding, accordingly, 1½ million losses for 1917, we obtain 6 million total losses during the whole War" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The percentage of disabled was comparatively small. German statistics during the War figured it to be 10 per cent." (awkward transition)  
- [SYNTAX] "Hence the figure of 3½ million must comprize only a little less than 3 million in killed alone." (awkward phrasing and spelling of "comprise")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from military operations to casualty statistics without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of casualty figures without clear progression or new insights  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Russia's role without clear organization or signposting  
- [CLARITY] The use of mathematical calculations to derive casualty figures is confusing and lacks clear explanation  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the military analysis to the conclusion section is abrupt  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion section repeats points already made in the body without adding new analysis  
- [LOGIC] The final numbered point (5.) is incomplete, suggesting the text was cut off mid-argument  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently uses absolute numbers without contextualizing them for the reader  
- [LOGIC] The comparison of Russian losses to other countries is presented without clear purpose or logical flow  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraphing to separate different analytical points  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
