Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Both opposing forces feel the chill of winter and the penetrated rain." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Sheridan, having destroyed the remnants of Early’s forces at Waynesboro, Va., on March 2, have cleared the Shenandoah Valley..." (verb tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "which perplex them" (pronoun case error; should be "perplexed them")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Shoulded the attack fail" (incorrect verb form; should be "Should the attack fail")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Union resistance in this early stage is ineffective" (tense inconsistency; should be "was ineffective")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the positions they have been ordered to capture" (tense inconsistency; should be "had been ordered")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Gordon received an order from Lee to withdrew his men" (incorrect verb form; should be "withdraw")  
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" (correct, but may be considered overly formal or stylistically inconsistent)  
- [SYNTAX] "The discouragement of the homesick, who never knew when, or if, they would return to their homes, was a hardship not peculiar to any rank." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The forces joined battle along Harrison’s Creek and the Confederates were soon forced back to Fort Stedman." (awkward transition between clauses)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from a general description of the Petersburg campaign to a detailed account of the Fort Stedman attack without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section begins with a list of battle dates and locations, then transitions into a narrative about the campaign and Fort Stedman, creating a disjointed structure.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the discouragement of the homesick, who never knew when, or if, they would return to their homes, was a hardship not peculiar to any rank" is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the general description of the war to the specific account of the Fort Stedman attack is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the general conditions of the war to the specific military strategy of Lee and Gordon without sufficient context or explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
