Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "Jews" in "the world still tends to see them as Crabbe saw them a century ago in his 'Borough'".  
- [SPELLING] "tell" should be "told" in "when the tale was tell of such a man".  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "He was a real scholar; not only in the general sense of one who loved great books, but also in the special sense that he possessed the technical knowledge of an expert."  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "At the Talmud meetings held at the house of Arthur Davis were founded lifelong intimacies."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing in "There is a rather silly proverb that the self-teach man has a fool for his master."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the critique of Jewish identity to the eulogy of Arthur Davis without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section transitions abruptly from a literary analysis to a biographical tribute, making the narrative flow disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of quoting Homer and the reference to "Hebrew Accents" is not clearly connected to the broader theme.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the poem by Nina Salaman and the eulogy of Arthur Davis.
