- [SPELLING] "died man" (should be "dead man")  
- [SPELLING] "the died man" (should be "the dead man")  
- [SYNTAX] "He could not recross the river. His proud spirit quailed at the thought of retreat, but to engage in another battle just then might mean ruin." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [LEXICON] "He is alone! The others had departed." (sudden shift in tone and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the battle to Robert's personal thoughts and memories without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the battle to the aftermath and then to Robert's personal journey without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Debby Mason" and the search for a boy is introduced without sufficient context or explanation  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph begins with "He is alone!" which feels disconnected from the preceding narrative  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Molly" as a drummer is introduced without prior context, making the reference confusing  
- [LOGIC] The final lines about "Beat the drum bravely, Molly my boy!" feel abrupt and disconnected from the narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
