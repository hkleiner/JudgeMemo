Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "would had been wantonly sacrificed" (incorrect modal verb usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the monastic kitchen have been converted" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the soil hallowed by the memories... England is was released" (awkward phrasing and incorrect tense usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the buildings restored or reconstruct" (missing past participle)  
- [GRAMMAR] "all one can desired" (incorrect verb form)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the cathedral to the city walls and historical events without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple locations (abbey, cathedral, St. Martin's Church) without clear organization or logical flow  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow (e.g., "the soil hallowed by the memories of so many saintly lives and associated with the momentous days when England is was released from the toils of pagan ignorance")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs discussing different historical periods and locations
