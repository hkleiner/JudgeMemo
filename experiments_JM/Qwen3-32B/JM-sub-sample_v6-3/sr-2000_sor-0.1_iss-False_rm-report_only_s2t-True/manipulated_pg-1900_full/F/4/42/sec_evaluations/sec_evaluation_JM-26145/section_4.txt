Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "they am professedly written" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "Nimmuria feel his end approaching" (tense inconsistency; should be "felt")  
- [SYNTAX] "and I destroyed them. Not one man from their midst returned to his own land." (awkward phrasing and lack of transition)  
- [LEXICON] "the so-called 'marriage scarab' of Nimmuria bears witness to this" (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in long sentences, e.g., "To Nimmuria, the great king, the king of Egypt, my brother, my brother-in-law; who loves me and whom I love: Tushratta..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Tushratta’s early letters to his later behavior without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The letter excerpts are inserted abruptly without clear integration into the narrative  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the language is that of Hanirabbat and this we are still unable to read" is unclear in context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Tushratta’s letters to the mention of Nimmuria’s death and the reforming king Napkhuria  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the Egyptian king’s actions and the Babylonian response is not clearly explained  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
