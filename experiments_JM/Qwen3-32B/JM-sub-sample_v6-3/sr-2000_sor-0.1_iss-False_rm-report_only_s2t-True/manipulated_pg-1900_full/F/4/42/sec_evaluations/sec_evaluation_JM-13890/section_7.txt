Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The effect of emptiness existing to-day is vastly different to what the pilgrims used to gaze upon..." (awkward phrasing and incorrect preposition "to" instead of "from")  
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SYNTAX] "necessitate through the determination not to alter the plan..." (incorrect verb form; should be "necessitated")  
- [LEXICON] "if they have go no farther in the study..." (incorrect verb form; should be "gone")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "To the west is a fine thirteenth-century mosaic pavement similar to that in the Confessor's Chapel at Westminster Abbey, to which it is very fitting to compare this chapel..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from historical descriptions to modern political commentary ("Such words are deeply interesting at the present day...") without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between architectural descriptions, historical figures, and political events without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the main idea  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs discussing different aspects of the cathedral (e.g., from monuments to architectural styles to political history)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
