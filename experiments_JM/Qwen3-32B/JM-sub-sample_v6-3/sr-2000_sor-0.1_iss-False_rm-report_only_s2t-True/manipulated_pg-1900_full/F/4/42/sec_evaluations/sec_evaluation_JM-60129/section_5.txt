- [GRAMMAR] "The central square connecting these four buildings, which lack their inner walls, was raised two stories and crown by a four-cornered roof with carve roof-trees" (missing verb tense and incorrect adjective form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The place of honour, that is, the centre of the wall behind the altar, was occupied by a bronze statue of Tsunkoa (the same in both Yögur and Tangut), half a metre high, wrapped in a piece of red cloth" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)

- [GRAMMAR] "I said goodbye to a group of lamas, who, no longer terrified at my craniometer, had assembled to saw me off" (incorrect verb form)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of the monastery and the author's personal experiences without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the temple and its contents is highly detailed but lacks a clear organizational structure, making it difficult to follow the spatial layout.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms and names (e.g., "t'umu," "Shke lama," "Tangutan") are not clearly explained, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the cultural context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the physical structure of the monastery to the religious practices and beliefs of the lamas is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph describing the departure from the monastery and the landscape is disconnected from the preceding detailed descriptions of the temple and lamas.
