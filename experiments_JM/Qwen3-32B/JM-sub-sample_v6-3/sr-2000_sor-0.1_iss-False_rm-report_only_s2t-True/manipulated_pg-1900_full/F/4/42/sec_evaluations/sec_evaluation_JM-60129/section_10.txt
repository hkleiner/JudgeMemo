Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "reined iu my horse" (likely a typo for "reined in my horse")  
- [SPELLING] "tshuavá and sujá" (unusual spelling, possibly non-standard transliteration)  
- [SYNTAX] "the yamen [...] still lay half in ruins" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the small temples built high on the steep rocks are still there" (awkward and repetitive)  
- [SPELLING] "discribed" (misspelling of "described")  
- [SYNTAX] "the deaf old gentlemen's politeness went so far as to promise me on my next visit (!) five sable skins" (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] "civilities" (possibly a typo or misused word)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from farewell to detailed geographical description without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The description of the valley and river is dense and lacks clear progression, making it difficult to follow the route  
- [CLARITY] Some terms like "doukey caravans" and "t'umu's adopted daughter" are unclear without additional context  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the farewell scene to the journey and then to the town of Li-yen is abrupt and lacks smooth connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Potanin's expedition and the unchanged state of the town is somewhat disjointed from the main narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
