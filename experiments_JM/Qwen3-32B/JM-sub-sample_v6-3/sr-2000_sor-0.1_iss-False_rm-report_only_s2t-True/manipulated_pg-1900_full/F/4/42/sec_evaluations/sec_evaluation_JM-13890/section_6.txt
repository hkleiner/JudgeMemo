Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It might be that the modern pilgrim, whose course is thus arrested by the vision he sees in this cleft called Mercery Lane, might have had some intention..." (redundant "might")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is a strong man who resists the appeal..." (awkward phrasing; should be "He is a strong man who can resist...")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The windows at the east and west ends was the largest in the Cathedral." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "If it shoulded be in the twilight..." (incorrect past tense "shoulded")  
- [SPELLING] "Frame between the spreading branches..." (likely should be "Framed")  
- [SYNTAX] "To wipe out Becket's name completely Henry VIII. would have needed to demolish the whole church." (awkward word order)  
- [SYNTAX] "Armed even with such brief information as that given in the preceding chapter, one gazes..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The south arcade of this chapel, consisting of four Norman arches with an ivy-grown clerestory, is still standing..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "To wipe out Becket's name completely Henry VIII. would have needed to demolish the whole church." (confusing logic; unclear how this connects to the previous description of the Cathedral)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between architectural descriptions and historical anecdotes without clear transitions, making the narrative feel disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] "The windows at the east and west ends was the largest in the Cathedral." (confusing and unclear due to grammatical error)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the cloister to the interior of the Cathedral is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] "It may be that average lives are so planless, so haphazard and without order..." (sudden philosophical reflection feels disconnected from the architectural tour)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
