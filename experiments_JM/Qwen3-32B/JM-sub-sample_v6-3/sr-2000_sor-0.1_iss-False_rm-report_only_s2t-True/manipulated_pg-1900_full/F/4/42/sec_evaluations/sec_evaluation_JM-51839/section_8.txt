- [SPELLING] "Chas. H. Sims" (abbreviation may be unclear to some readers)  
- [SPELLING] "Chas. H. Sims, Treasurer pro tem; Adolphus Sterne, Secretary pro tem" (inconsistent capitalization of "pro tem")

- [SYNTAX] "Let us be awakened to this opportunity to complete the noble edifice, making it available to be used by the citizens as a club center and a museum" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical topics (e.g., El Camino Real, Masonic Lodge, Texas’ Monument to a Great Empresario, and Old Nacogdoches University Building) without clear transitions or logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the El Camino Real and the Masonic Lodge is not clearly established, making the narrative feel disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The final chapter on the Nacogdoches University building feels disconnected from the previous historical content, with no clear thematic link.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the university building is vague and lacks a clear purpose or focus, making it difficult to understand the author's intent.  
- [TRANSITION] There is no clear transition between the "Masonic Lodge" chapter and the "Texas’ Monument to a Great Empresario" chapter, which disrupts the flow of the text.
