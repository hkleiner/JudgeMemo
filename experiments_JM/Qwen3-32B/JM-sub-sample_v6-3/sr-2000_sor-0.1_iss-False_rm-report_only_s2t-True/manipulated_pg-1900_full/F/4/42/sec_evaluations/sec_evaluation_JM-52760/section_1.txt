2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from a general overview of the war to a list of battles and movements without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The list of battles and movements is presented in a disconnected manner, lacking explanation or context for how they relate to the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg" is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on Union strategy to the section on the strategic importance of Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph on Petersburg's strategic importance is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the reader without a complete understanding of the point being made.
