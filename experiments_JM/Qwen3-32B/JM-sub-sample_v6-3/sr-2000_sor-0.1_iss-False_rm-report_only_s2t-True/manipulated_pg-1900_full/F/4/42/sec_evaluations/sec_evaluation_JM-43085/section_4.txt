Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is a bibliophile, and he is in the midst of old books!" (awkward repetition of "he is")  
- [GRAMMAR] "You could hardly believed how vividly..." (incorrect verb form "believed" instead of "believe")  
- [GRAMMAR] "But where in the world did M. Meissonier come across..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Revue des Deux Mondes, in its critical review of the Salon, bestow upon this picture..." (subject-verb agreement error: "bestow" should be "bestowed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is precisely this difference between one human being and another, in other words, this quality of individuality..." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "and then afterwards called to mind the various types, episodes, scenes, dramas that he has actually see." (incorrect verb form "see" instead of "seen")  
- [GRAMMAR] "One can never grow tired of quoting Gautier apropos of an artist whose brush always had something in common with his pen." (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Meissonier's artistic development to quoting Th√©ophile Gautier without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The detailed description of "The Smoker" interrupts the narrative flow and lacks a clear connection to the broader argument  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., Meissonier's early career, his works, critical reception) without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is somewhat abstract and lacks a clear connection to the preceding content, making the conclusion feel abrupt  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Meissonier's success to the quote from Gautier is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
