- [SPELLING] "nicer not" (missing word; should be "nicer not to tell people")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Excalibur's experiences to Eileen and the curate's conversation without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The hare and motor horn incident feels disconnected from the main narrative about Excalibur and the curate/Eileen's relationship  
- [LOGIC] The dialogue between Eileen and the curate is detailed but lacks clear connection to the earlier parts of the text  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different events (tennis, golf, country walks, and the curate's conversation) without smooth transitions  
- [CLARITY] The ending is abrupt and lacks resolution or connection to the earlier parts of the text
