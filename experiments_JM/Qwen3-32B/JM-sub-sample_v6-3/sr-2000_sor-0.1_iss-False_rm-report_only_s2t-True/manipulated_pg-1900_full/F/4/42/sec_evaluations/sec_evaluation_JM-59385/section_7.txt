2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's internal reflections to the description of the procession and then to the years that follow, with little transitional clarity  
- [STRUCTURE] The repeated use of "Wherein" followed by short lines disrupts the narrative flow and feels disconnected from the surrounding prose  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the mother could not meet them at the doorway too" is ambiguous and confusing  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the festival scene to the years of Kuei Ping's life is abrupt and lacks smooth progression  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the description of the baby girl to Fuh Tang's sudden death is jarring and lacks sufficient foreshadowing or emotional buildup
