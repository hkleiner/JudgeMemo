2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples (e.g., billiard-ball, earth's orbit) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The distinction between "physico-chemical" and "vital" processes is introduced but not consistently clarified.  
- [LOGIC] The concept of "knowledge" is used in multiple, overlapping senses (e.g., physiological, gravitational, cognitive) without clear differentiation.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about "awareness" is introduced but not resolved, leaving the reader with unresolved questions.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Spencer's faint class" and "vivid class" is unclear without prior context.  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of "cortical process" and "psycho-physical parallelism" is dense and lacks a clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] The text introduces the idea of "heredity-relatedness" but does not fully explain how it connects to the broader argument.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from "gravitative knowledge" to "biological knowledge" is abrupt and lacks a clear bridge.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about "cognition being aware of itself" is introduced but not clearly explained or supported.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Mr. Bertrand Russell" and his concept of "description" without elaboration, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the reference.
