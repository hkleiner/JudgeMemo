- [GRAMMAR] "Focal point, inheritor and trustee of the world--exists to know its Creator..." (awkward punctuation and phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "focal point, inheritor and trustee of the world--exists to know its Creator..." (missing article before "focal point")  
- [GRAMMAR] "One of the most cherished of the Qur'án's surihs takes up the metaphor..." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the case of the Hebrew prophets, the Divine intermediary that was later to appear in Christianity in the person of the Son of Man and in Islám as the Book of God assume the form..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was in the world," the Gospel declares, "and the world was make by him...." (incorrect verb form "make" instead of "made")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the blessings their work has confer." (incorrect verb form "confer" instead of "conferred")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different religious texts and concepts without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the idea of religion as "submission" and the broader theme of unity is not clearly articulated.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of religion as a "dual knowledge system" with science is introduced but not fully explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the role of religious figures to the social status of women is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about women's social status feels disconnected from the preceding discussion about the unity of religion.
