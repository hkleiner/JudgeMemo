- [SPELLING] "cocoanut" (nonstandard spelling; should be "coconut")  
- [SPELLING] "vehiclo" (misspelled; should be "vehicle")  
- [GRAMMAR] "whether the season be wet or dry, your pleasure would be regulated..." (incorrect modal verb usage; should be "is")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the languages of two towns a few miles apart are so different that one would scarcely recognize them as belonging to the same race of people." (awkward phrasing)

- [GRAMMAR] "To judge from the most reliable information, the poorest class do not have an abundance of food..." (subject-verb agreement error; "do" should be "does")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of Manila to descriptions of rural Filipino life without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The contrast between Manila and the "quiet little hamlet" is clear, but the shift in tone and subject is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the Filipino sitting-room is detailed but lacks a clear purpose or focus, making it feel somewhat disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the leper colony is introduced abruptly and lacks context or connection to the preceding content.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from descriptions of Filipino homes to the tao and then to the middle class without clear organization or progression.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the tao's eating habits is detailed but lacks a clear connection to the broader theme of Filipino life.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "give one of the young ladies a sheep's-eye in the mirror" is unclear and potentially confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph on the leper colony is introduced without explanation or context, making it feel disconnected from the rest of the text.
