Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Fragonard suspected, and somewhat resented the suspicion, that he was was made to paint..." (double "was")  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had the rough accent of Provence; is thick-set and clumsy of figure..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Pompadour had bring the wits and leading artists of her time." (incorrect verb form; should be "brought")  
- [GRAMMAR] "She and Fragonard fall a-kissing." (awkward phrasing; missing preposition or verb)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Fragonard's marriage at once affect his habits and his art." (missing "did" or "affected")  
- [SPELLING] "light-o'-love" (inconsistent hyphenation or spacing)  
- [SPELLING] "light-o'-love" (repeated; could be a stylistic choice but inconsistent)  
- [SYNTAX] "He simply took from them such part of their craftsmanship as could enter into the facile gracious genius of France without clogging its grace." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The wild oats of his artistic career were near sown." (uncommon phrasing; "near sown" is unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He is now content with his house and garden for scenery, with his family for models." (missing comma after "scenery" for clarity)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The fact was that the Du Barry was of the gutter. She had the crude love of fineries of the girl promoted from the gutter." (repetition and redundancy; unclear logical connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Du Barry's rejection of Fragonard's work to the description of her vulgar tastes is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [CLARITY] "He simply took from them such part of their craftsmanship as could enter into the facile gracious genius of France without clogging its grace." (confusing and abstract phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Du Barry's story to Fragonard's marriage and artistic evolution is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] "He realises that an artist has no need to go abroad to find 'paintable things.'" (sudden shift in perspective from third-person to a generalised statement)  
- [LOGIC] "Fragonard's old master, Boucher, for some time had been 'going about like a shadow of himself.'" (unclear reference and abrupt ending to the section)
