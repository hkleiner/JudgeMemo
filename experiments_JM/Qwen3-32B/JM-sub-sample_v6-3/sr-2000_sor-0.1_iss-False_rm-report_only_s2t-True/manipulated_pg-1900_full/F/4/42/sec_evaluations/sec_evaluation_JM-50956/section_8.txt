Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "she will always remain an immense, great, rich, and therefore powerful, country" (missing comma after "powerful")  
- [SYNTAX] "Too much will depend upon what this coming Russia may have to say, for any sensible statesman to refuse to reckon with that eventuality" (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "powerful" in "immense, great, rich, and therefore powerful, country"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the future of Russia to a call for Western statesmen to consider its importance, with little transitional support  
- [CLARITY] "Ostrich politics may least of all be applied in dealing with that tremendous military and political factor..." is vague and could be clearer  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph introduces a new idea without clearly linking it to the previous discussion of Russia's future  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
