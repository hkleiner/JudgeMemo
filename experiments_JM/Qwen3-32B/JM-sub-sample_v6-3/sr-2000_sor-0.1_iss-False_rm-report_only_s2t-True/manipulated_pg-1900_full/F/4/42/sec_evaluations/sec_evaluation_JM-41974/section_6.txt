Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "had had the palace adorn by the greatest painters" (incorrect verb form)
- [GRAMMAR] "painted ease and luxury on a broad scale" (missing preposition)
- [SPELLING] "adorn" should be "adorned"
- [GRAMMAR] "he had entered well into the fifties" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "he would have completed his sixtieth year" (confusing tense usage)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing Veronese's works in Venice to his international fame without clear transition
- [LOGIC] Jump from discussing Veronese's works in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi to his international commissions feels abrupt
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between Veronese's artistic style and his later years
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about Veronese's death and legacy feels disconnected from the preceding content
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different locations and time periods without clear signposting

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
