Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is just as simple to understood that..."  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is difficult to understand how a serious-minded military leader can stoop to employ, in a supposedly serious work, methods fit for the yellow press, such as accusing Russian generals of treason, etc., etc."  
- [GRAMMAR] "These memoirs, as a whole, am met at the time of their publication by sharp and adverse criticism in the foreign, and even the German, press."  
- [GRAMMAR] "It may was easily seen from this that while Ludendorf gives Samsonov twice as many men as he have in reality..."  
- [GRAMMAR] "he, at the same time, credits Rennenkampf with three times the number he actually had."  
- [SPELLING] "sonov" (likely a typo for "war" or "war effort")  
- [SPELLING] "sanguine World struggle" (likely a typo or misused term)  
- [SPELLING] "consecrated to the common cause of the Allies" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the entire burden of fought the Central Powers devolved upon the Armies of France and Russia."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from discussing the Moltke plan to the role of Russia in the Marne, without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about Ludendorf's memoirs is introduced suddenly and is not clearly connected to the prior discussion of the Moltke plan.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the sanguine World struggle" is unclear and may confuse the reader.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps of the first three years of the War, maps which speak only of two principal fronts, the French and the Russian, and no other--to grasp the significance..." is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical events and arguments without a clear narrative thread.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of the Moltke plan to the critique of Ludendorf's memoirs is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
