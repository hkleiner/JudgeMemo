2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the mission of Bahá'u'lláh to a detailed description of religious prophecies without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between abstract theological concepts and concrete examples without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex and obscure the main point (e.g., "the fundamental difference distinguished the mission of Bahá'u'lláh from political and ideological projects of human design")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs discussing different aspects of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and the broader context of religion and history
