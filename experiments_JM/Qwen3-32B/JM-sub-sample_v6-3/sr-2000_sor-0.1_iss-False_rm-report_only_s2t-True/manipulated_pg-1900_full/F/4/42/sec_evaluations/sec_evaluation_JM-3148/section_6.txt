- [GRAMMAR] "I should stand it till ’bout Friday—seein’ ’em lay on the grass there" (non-standard contraction and verb form "lay" instead of "lie")  
- [GRAMMAR] "As a matter of fact, Lyddy was revelling in house-furnishing of a humble sort" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had a passion for colour" (non-standard spelling "colour")  
- [GRAMMAR] "She knotted white fringes for the table-covers and curtains, painted the inside of the fireplace red, put some pots of scarlet geraniums on the window-sills" (run-on sentence with multiple actions)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I hope Mrs. Butterfield was happy enough in Paradise to appreciate and feel Lyddy’s joy" (awkward phrasing)

- [GRAMMAR] "One might indeed had sung of this little red violin" (incorrect verb form "had")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Aunt Hitty's observations to Lyddy's interior decorating is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from Lyddy's domestic activities to her emotional response to Anthony Croft's music is sudden and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of a long quotation from Shelley's poem feels disconnected from the narrative flow and lacks a clear purpose in the context.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Lyddy's house-furnishing is detailed but lacks a clear progression or purpose, making it feel somewhat disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Lyddy's emotional transformation is somewhat vague and lacks a clear cause-effect relationship with the music.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the violin and the Shelley poem is overly long and disrupts the narrative flow.
