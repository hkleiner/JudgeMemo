Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he could not conceive of, unless around a sumptuous table" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "If he wish to paint a Last Supper" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [SPELLING] "mould and filagreed in arabesque" (likely typo: "filagreed" should be "filigreed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he had arrive in Venice" (incorrect verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "how could he had failed" (incorrect verb form; should be "had he failed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he attributed considerable space to vases, furniture, armour, fruits, flowers, graceful draperies, brilliant costumes, mettlesome horses, and more especially dogs" (run-on list with inconsistent phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Veronese's life and artistic style without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Veronese's admiration for other artists is abruptly followed by a discussion of his personal life, creating a disjointed flow.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "he attributed considerable space to vases, furniture, armour, fruits, flowers, graceful draperies, brilliant costumes, mettlesome horses, and more especially dogs" is overly long and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of Veronese's artistic style to his private life is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Veronese's friendship with Torlioni is introduced without a clear connection to the preceding discussion of his artistic style.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
