2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the murder to the canonization of Becket without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from the murder scene to the monks' reaction and the discovery of the hair-cloth shirt feels abrupt  
- [LOGIC] The transition to the relic trade and the story of Roger is disjointed and lacks clear connection to the previous narrative  
- [LOGIC] The final section about King Henry's penance is a significant shift in focus with little to no transition  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the murder that the autocratic Archbishop who had not inspired..." is confusing and lacks clarity  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the murder" is vague and could refer to multiple events  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative moves between multiple events (murder, canonization, relic trade, Henry's penance) without clear organization or transitions
