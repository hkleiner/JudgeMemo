- [GRAMMAR] "we were had a dinner party..." (incorrect verb form "were had")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Lady Wickham appeared to noticed it too." (incorrect verb form "noticed")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Excalibur's behavior on the tennis lawn to the dinner party is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift from the bone incident to the dinner party and Lady Wickham's discomfort is jarring and lacks smooth narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The ending with Lady Wickham and the bone is somewhat confusing due to the lack of clear setup for the punchline.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between multiple events (bone, dinner party, village walks) without clear transitions or logical progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
