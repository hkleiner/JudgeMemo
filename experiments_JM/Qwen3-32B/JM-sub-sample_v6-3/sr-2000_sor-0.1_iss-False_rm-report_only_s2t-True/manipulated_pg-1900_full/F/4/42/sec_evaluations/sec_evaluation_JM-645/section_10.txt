Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the information she must have had from George Corvick—the information you know, that had come to him, poor chap, in one of the happiest hours of his life, straight from Hugh Vereker." (awkward and repetitive phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the information you know, that had come to him, poor chap, in one of the happiest hours of his life, straight from Hugh Vereker." (awkward interruption and phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was still there to be honoured by what mighted be done—he was no longer there to give it his sanction." (incorrect verb form "mighted")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Who alas but he have the authority?" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the second cost the mother her life." (passive phrasing could be clearer)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He looked at me like a dim phrenological bust." (awkward metaphor)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "I deliberately offered him, to have done with the matter for ever, that advantage for which I felt he had long been looked." (confusing phrasing and unclear reference to "advantage")  
- [LOGIC] "He looked at me like a dim phrenological bust." (jarring metaphor that disrupts narrative flow)  
- [CLARITY] "I had above all to remind myself that with Vereker’s death the major incentive dropped." (vague and ambiguous phrasing)  
- [LOGIC] "He was still there to be honoured by what mighted be done—he was no longer there to give it his sanction." (confusing logic and unclear reference to "it")  
- [LOGIC] "I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [LOGIC] "He simply hadn’t the art to use what he knew; he literally was incompetent to take up the duty where Corvick had left it." (confusing and repetitive logic)
