- [GRAMMAR] "But in reality Akiba meant what he say--what indeed have been say throughout the Bible from Deuteronomy downwards."  
- [GRAMMAR] "can it was reconciled with his general doctrine..."  
- [SPELLING] "mediæval" (archaic spelling, not an error per se, but inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "The wind of creation and inspiration bloweth where it listeth." (archaic phrasing, but not strictly incorrect)  
- [SPELLING] "Encyclopædia" (archaic spelling, not an error per se, but inconsistent with modern usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Jewish mysticism to scientific explanations of national missions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical figures, literary references, and philosophical ideas without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "The wind of creation and inspiration bloweth where it listeth" is abstract and not clearly connected to the surrounding context.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the discussion of Jewish election to the comparison with American and English national self-consciousness.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "The Melting Pot" and its universal mission is introduced without sufficient prior context or explanation.
