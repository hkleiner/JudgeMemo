Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "we may said" should be "we may say"  
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded" should be "could"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was legion" should be "were legion"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was progressively more complex" should be "became progressively more complex"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was postulated" should be "is postulated"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was taken for granted" should be "is taken for granted"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was reversed" should be "can be reversed"  
- [GRAMMAR] "was within sight" should be "was within sight" (contextually correct, but "was" is used in past tense where present tense might be more appropriate)  
- [GRAMMAR] "speak" should be "spoke"  
- [GRAMMAR] "connect" should be "connected"  
- [GRAMMAR] "characterized the higher evolutionary products" should be "characterize the higher evolutionary products"  
- [GRAMMAR] "calls in the Unknowable" should be "calls on the Unknowable"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the discussion of constitutive properties in physico-chemical systems to the cognitive type is abrupt and lacks clear logical connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract concepts (e.g., "A, B, C") and concrete examples (e.g., water molecules) without clear signposting or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "additive" and "constitutive" properties is introduced but not clearly elaborated, leading to potential confusion.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the hierarchy of implication (C implies B, B implies A) is introduced but not fully explained or justified.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to Spencer's "chasm" and the claim that it is "absolute" is mentioned but not clearly connected to the broader argument.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from empirical observation to philosophical speculation (e.g., the role of the "Unknowable") is abrupt and lacks a clear bridge.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about "new properties" and their unpredictability is introduced but not clearly tied back to the earlier discussion of relatedness and evolution.
