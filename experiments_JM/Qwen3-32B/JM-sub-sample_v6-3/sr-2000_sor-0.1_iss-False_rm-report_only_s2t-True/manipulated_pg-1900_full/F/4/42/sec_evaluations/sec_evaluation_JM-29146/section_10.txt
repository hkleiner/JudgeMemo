Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "we would came here" should be "we would come here"
- [GRAMMAR] "did not understood our discovery" should be "did not understand our discovery"
- [GRAMMAR] "Vardin say" should be "Vardin said"
- [SPELLING] "Ramar Chind and Chind" appears to be a repetition or typo
- [SPELLING] "Ramar Chind" is inconsistent with earlier reference to "Ramsey"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance and disappearance of Vardin and the black box is somewhat confusing without more context
- [LOGIC] The transformation of Garr Symm into his caveman ancestors is abrupt and not fully explained
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the action sequence to the philosophical explanation feels somewhat jarring
- [CLARITY] The concept of "matter-transmission" and its implications are introduced but not fully explained
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the physical confrontation to the philosophical discussion lacks smooth transition
