- [LOGIC] Repetition of the question "Where will Russia be then?" without new context or development  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical analysis and speculative future scenarios without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] The final section is vague and lacks clear focus, making it difficult to follow the author's argument  
- [TRANSITION] Poor transitions between paragraphs, especially between the historical analysis and the speculative future scenarios  
- [LOGIC] The argument about Germany's future resurgence is not clearly connected to the earlier discussion of Russia's WWI role  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the immense Russian nation, with 125 million souls of pure Russian blood alone, will always remain that heavy military weight..." is unclear and ambiguous  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Germany and France's populations is introduced abruptly without clear connection to the previous discussion
