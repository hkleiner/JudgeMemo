2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the historical narrative to the discussion of St. Martin's is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple topics (churches, historical events, archaeological findings) without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the other great figures of the period" is vague and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the excavation in 1901 is detailed but not clearly connected to the broader narrative  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Canterbury's growth and the Danes' attack is disconnected from the preceding discussion of churches and archaeology
