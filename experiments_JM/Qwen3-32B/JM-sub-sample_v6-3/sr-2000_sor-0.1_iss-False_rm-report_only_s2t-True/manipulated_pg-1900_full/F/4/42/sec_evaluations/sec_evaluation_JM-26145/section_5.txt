Evaluation Form:

- [GRAMMAR] "He seems to have think he was acting..."  
- [SPELLING] "am brought by the approach of death..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is quite possible that Nimmuria had ordered the images in question to be made for his worthy friend without giving any formal promise to send them..."  
- [LEXICON] "The old king, who had called Ishtar of Nineveh to his help, may have am brought by the approach of death..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrative of Tushratta and Napkhuria to a new section labeled "IV. LETTERS FROM ASIATIC VASSALS" without transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph abruptly introduces a new topic without clear connection to the preceding content  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Gilia" is unclear and lacks sufficient context for the reader to follow the argument  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the detailed letter to Teye to the broader geopolitical implications is abrupt and lacks smooth connection
