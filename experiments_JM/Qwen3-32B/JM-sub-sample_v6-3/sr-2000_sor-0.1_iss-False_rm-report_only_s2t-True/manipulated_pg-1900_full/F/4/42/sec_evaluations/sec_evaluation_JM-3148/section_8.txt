2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Lyddy's actions to Anthony's internal thoughts about his mother without clear transition
- [LOGIC] The final sentence "Her house seemed strange to her that night." feels abrupt and disconnected from the preceding emotional exchange
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the good Samaritan" is somewhat confusing in context
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Anthony's memories of his mother is lengthy and could benefit from clearer segmentation
