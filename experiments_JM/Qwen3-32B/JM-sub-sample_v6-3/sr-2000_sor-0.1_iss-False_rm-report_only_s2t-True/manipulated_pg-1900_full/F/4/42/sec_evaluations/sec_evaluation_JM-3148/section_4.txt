- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Anthony Croft's character to the death of Mrs. Butterfield with no clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from philosophical musings about Anthony to a detailed narrative about a funeral with no clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts from one character (Anthony) to another (Mrs. Butterfield) without explanation  
- [CLARITY] The text references "nineteen coffin-plates" without sufficient context for their significance  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the poetic quote to the narrative about Mrs. Butterfield is abrupt and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about Aunt Hitty's funeral planning is detailed but lacks a clear purpose or connection to the previous section
