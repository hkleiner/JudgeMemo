Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "we could not make up our minds whether France or Russia was the potential enemy" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia, Prussia, and Austria, acting together, were not to was resisted" (incorrect verb form "was")  
- [GRAMMAR] "an Atlantic stage of world-commerce begin" (tense inconsistency; should be "began")  
- [SPELLING] "say bluntly" (should be "said bluntly")  
- [GRAMMAR] "We must not laughed at that architectural monstrosity" (incorrect verb form; should be "laughed" → "laugh")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the enragés of Europe began to preach class-hatred and to find many listeners" (awkward phrasing; "to find" is redundant)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the mad race of competitive armaments... was begun" (awkward phrasing; "was begun" is passive and less natural than "began")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Pope wobbled and then came down heavily on the side of the old order" (awkward phrasing; "wobbled" is informal and unclear in this context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the Crimean War to the discussion of the 1848 revolutions is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing European politics to the Romanticist revolution and Victorian literature is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Romanticist revolution and Victorian literature is disconnected from the preceding political and economic analysis.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "the Pope wobbled and then came down heavily on the side of the old order" is vague and lacks clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Tennyson and the Victorian figures is a digression that is not clearly connected to the broader historical narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of the Great Exhibition to the Romanticist revolution is abrupt and lacks a logical link.
