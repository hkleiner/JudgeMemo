- [GRAMMAR] "I in my turn am coming to believed" (should be "coming to believe")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Positive though he may be that..." (awkward phrasing; should be "Though he may be positive that...")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he will still continue fact" (incomplete sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But just tried to moderate the ideal and the self-conceit!" (missing "have" or "had")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the virtue of an ideal is its unattainability. It seems, when it is first formed, just as attainable as a worldly ambition which indeed is often schemed as a means to it." (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It would. But just tried to moderate the ideal and the self-conceit!" (incomplete sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Common sense might persuade him to attempt to kept down the ideal" (should be "keep down")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is bear with them" (should be "born with them")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He can maim his belief in himself by persistent abandonment to folly, but he cannot lower its flame by an effort of the will, as he might lower the flame of a gas by a calculated turn of the hand." (awkward phrasing and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the secret and inmost constitution of humanity it is ordained that the disparity between the aim and the achievement shall seemed grotesque" (should be "shall seem grotesque")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the reaction after Christmas to the New Year's resolution without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The concept of "ideal" is introduced and discussed in a somewhat abstract and repetitive manner, making it difficult to follow the argument  
- [LOGIC] The text oscillates between philosophical reflection and narrative, which can confuse the reader  
- [LOGIC] The idea of "common sense" is introduced and then contrasted with human behavior in a way that is not clearly connected to the main argument  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about the "philosophy of the New Year's resolution" is somewhat abrupt and not clearly tied to the preceding discussion  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Chapter Nine to Chapter Ten is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The concept of "Evil" is introduced in Chapter Ten without prior context or definition, making it confusing  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph in Chapter Ten introduces a new idea about "Evil" without sufficient development or connection to the rest of the text
