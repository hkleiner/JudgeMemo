- [SYNTAX] "he is to be seen wandering about the Louvre dressed in a cloak or overcoat of a mixed grey cloth, without hooks or eyes or buttons--a cloak which the old man, when he is at work, ties at the waist with it does not matter what--a piece of string, a crumpled chiffon."  
- [SPELLING] "seventeen-hundreds" (should be "seventeenth century" or "1700s")  
- [SYNTAX] "The gods of elegance were dead; a severe and frigid morality stood upon their altars." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The old face smiles even through tears." (missing article or preposition)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's death to a broader historical and artistic analysis without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph jumps from Fragonard's death to a summary of French art history, making the connection unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "he is come into his own again, lord of a very realm of beauty" is vague and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Fragonard's death to the discussion of Watteau, Boucher, and Chardin is abrupt and lacks logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces new ideas (e.g., the role of Louis XIV, XV, XVI) that are not clearly connected to the preceding narrative.
