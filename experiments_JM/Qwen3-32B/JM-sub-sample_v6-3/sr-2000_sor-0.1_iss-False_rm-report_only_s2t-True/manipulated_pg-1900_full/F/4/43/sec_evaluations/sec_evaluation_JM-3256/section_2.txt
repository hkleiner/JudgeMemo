1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The and enter sects subjects into orthodox not does catholic the, all horror on matter bookman of an and, very subject is of has book the the." (fragmented and ungrammatical sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "He does not require Mr. Froude’s delightful apology to win the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ a place on his shelf, because, although the bookman may be far removed from Puritanism, yet he knows that Bunyan had the secret of English style, and although he may be as far from Romanism, yet he must needs have his A’Kempis (especially in Pickering’s edition of 1828), and when he places the two books side by side in the department of religion, he has a standing regret that there is no _Pilgrim’s Progress_ also in Pickering." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Milman he I8 in, and ’s edition counts Smith mean Rome the Gibbon vols., blue cloth, the very model of histories, yet he revels in those books which are the material for historians, the scattered stones out of which he builds his house, such as the diaries of John Evelyn and our gossip Pepys, and that scandalous book, _Grammont’s Memoirs_, and that most credulous but interesting of Scots annalists, Robert Wodrow." (confusing syntax and structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He is much indebted to a London publisher for a very careful edition of the _Spectator_, and still more to that good bookman, Mr. Austin Dobson, for his admirable introduction." (repetition and lack of variation in word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "One is _Robinson other_ the Crusoe and the _Pilgrim’s Progress_." (typographical error in book title)

- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing literary criticism to listing books and authors without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "Milman he I8 in, and ’s edition counts Smith mean Rome the Gibbon vols., blue cloth, the very model of histories, yet he revels in those books which are the material for historians..." (unclear and confusing sentence structure)  
- [TRANSITION] The text jumps from one author or book to another without clear connections or explanations.  
- [LOGIC] "One is _Robinson other_ the Crusoe and the _Pilgrim’s Progress_." (confusing phrasing that disrupts the logical flow)
