(run-on sentence with incoherent phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But,—even while many were frozen—and all endured untold agony from exposure and scanty covering, not a complaint was heard to pass the brave lips." (awkward punctuation and structure)

(incoherent and lacks logical progression)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph beginning with "The delay next shots down..." disrupts the narrative flow and lacks a clear connection to the preceding or following content.  
- [CLARITY] "He saw a still form beside a lonely road, he heard the last words of the dying man, 'Go to Plymouth and find Debby Mason, tell her that her father died like a soldier!'" (unclear reference to the dying man and his connection to Robert)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the battle scene to the final paragraph about Robert being alone is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
