Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "I’m afraid that what was uppermost in my mind during several anxious weeks was the sense that if we had only been in Paris I might have run over to see Corvick."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "the art of portraiture in oils."  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely interlaced that, taken together—which was how I had to take them—they form as good an illustration as I can recall of the manner in which, for the good of his soul doubtless, fate sometimes deals with a man’s avidity."  
- [SPELLING] "trouvaillle" is misspelled.  
- [SYNTAX] Confusing phrasing in "He had no command of that business: this had been brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator’s personal experience in Germany to the death of Mrs. Erme and Gwendolen’s marriage, with little transitional explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the idol" and "the figure in the carpet" is unclear without prior context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between multiple events (the narrator’s brother’s illness, Corvick’s article, Gwendolen’s marriage, and Corvick’s death) with minimal connection between them.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the narrator’s reflection on Corvick’s article to the tragic accident in Devonshire.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the narrator’s "avidity" and the events described is not clearly established.
