Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "That is why the portraits of courtesans arouse attention in fashion that women whose characters were undeveloped..." (awkward phrasing and grammatical error)  
- [SYNTAX] "We have but to turn to the work of his great contemporaries, Gainsborough and Romney, to see the difference between women in whose veins the blood runs red, and women who feed on nectar and ambrosia..." (complex sentence with poor flow)  
- [LEXICON] "The solid foundations decomposed, the surface colour of many a celebrity is now as pale as the sitter's own ghost may be supposed to be." (unusual phrasing and metaphor that is confusing)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had not studied Bellini and Correggio for nothing, and many of his little ones are far more like Italian angels in modern dress than English boys and girls." (from previous section, not evaluated)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It seems to the writer that women and children were to Reynolds fit and proper subjects for the exercise of his gifts, but at the same time, folk in whom he had no abiding interest." (sudden shift in perspective and unclear logic)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing Reynolds' portraits of women and children to his portraits of men is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [CLARITY] "There was a finality about the treatment that must have baffled and exasperated his rivals." (vague and lacks context for the reader)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Reynolds' portraits to the degradation of his paintings' colors is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection  
- [LOGIC] "That is why the portraits of courtesans arouse attention in fashion that women whose characters were undeveloped..." (confusing logic and unclear comparison)
