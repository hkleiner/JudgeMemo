- [SYNTAX] "The Russian Army, having obtained only the first consignments of inconsiderable and insufficient munitions, did not hesitate, in 1916, to offer her allies generous assistance on the largest scale."

- [LEXICON] "towards fulfill of quantity did her" is incoherent and lacks clarity.  
- [SYNTAX] "The effects of Brusilov's offensive proved to be so far-reaching as to affect not only the situation on the Italian front but also that on the French main front."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "So Russia received as her towards fulfill of quantity did her, had her allies more as Army soon some once obligation munitions." is incoherent and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Brusilov offensive to the discussion of munitions is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph on Romania is disconnected from the preceding discussion of munitions and logistics.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the 1916 offensive to the Romanian campaign lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The Russian Army had not yet succeeded in recuperating from the effects of its great summer offensive of 1916" is followed by a sudden shift to the Romanian campaign without clear linkage.
