- [SYNTAX] "But in the doctrine of implication they are just the laws of B and C respectively, though laws of A may underlie them in a logical sense."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete scientific examples without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is dense and lacks clear paragraphing to distinguish between different ideas or sub-arguments.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as the one beginning with "What simply that I that more in; only which in there truth..."  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the doctrine of implication is abrupt and lacks explanatory context.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "A, B, C" is introduced but not consistently maintained in clarity throughout the text.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "constitutive" versus "additive" properties is not clearly explained in the context of the argument.
