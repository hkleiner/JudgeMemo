- [LOGIC] The sentence "I my own of eyes her glad yet shall “disposal able zone one” France be have seen and (not has with number that immense section that of the) I has something small been I the saw still, men at and of to but always use." is incoherent and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Nancy of over front miles the may from be, guns the so roar five the little heard that is plainly." is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of soldiers and civilians to the grammatically broken sentences is jarring and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Heine and the prophecy is thematically connected but the preceding grammatical errors and incoherent sentences make the transition feel abrupt.
