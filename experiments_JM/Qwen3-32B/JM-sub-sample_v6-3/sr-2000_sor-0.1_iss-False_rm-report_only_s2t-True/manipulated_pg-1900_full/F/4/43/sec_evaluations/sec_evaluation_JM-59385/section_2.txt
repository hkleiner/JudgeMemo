- [GRAMMAR] "Her her the the they bound they long satin over to to sent will that which mother head of the new arrangement red family the wrapped of her hair around signifying band her."  
- [SPELLING] "sickening sweet perfume of the purple soi bean" (likely a typo or misused word)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The one o’clock feast had passed. The shadows of late afternoon sank into darkness."  
- [SYNTAX] "The old woman felt the shudder and the tense strain of the girl’s body as she fastened the tiny buttons of the collar of Kuei Ping’s dress." (repetition and wordiness)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the wedding preparations to an incoherent sentence about a minstrel and a hero.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from the wedding scene to a fragmented and unclear description of a song or chant.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Her her the the they bound they long satin over to to sent will that which mother head of the new arrangement red family the wrapped of her hair around signifying band her." is completely unclear and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the wedding preparations to the fragmented and disjointed sentence about a minstrel is jarring and unexplained.
