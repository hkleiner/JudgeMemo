- [GRAMMAR] "He was to reel under the first serious blow of his life." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was the life and soul of a group of brilliant men who gathered about him, having the deepest affection for him." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "he lived thereat a life almost opulent" (missing space between "thereat" and "a")  
- [LEXICON] "He was the life and soul of a group of brilliant men who gathered about him, having the deepest affection for him." (repetition of "him")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He went to a concert 'chez le lord Hamilton,' seeing and speaking with la belle Emma--Nelson's Emma." (inconsistent punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's personal life to the political events of the French Revolution with little transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Fragonard's personal experiences and broader historical events without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "The rose of the dawn was soon to turn to blood-red crimson." (metaphor is vague and confusing in context)  
- [TRANSITION] "The storm burst, and soon affairs became tragic red." (abrupt transition with no clear link to previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Fragonard's actions and the political events is not clearly explained.
