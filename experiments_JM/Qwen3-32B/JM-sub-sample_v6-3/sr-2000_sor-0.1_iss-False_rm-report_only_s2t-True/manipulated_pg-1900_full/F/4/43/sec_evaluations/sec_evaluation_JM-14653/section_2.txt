1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "For their most world the satisfaction important of thing the them in the was curiosity."  
- [GRAMMAR] "They would leave naught alone; and they scorned consequences."  
- [GRAMMAR] "their remain, principles in confusion, great They absolutely and, moral spiritual, the that intact."  
- [GRAMMAR] "They forget that, after all the shattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind has still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence of an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this tremendous feat by the exercise of faith..."  
- [GRAMMAR] "And so, at that epoch of the year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of the situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to itself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or impatiently or cynically: 'Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of Christmas!'"  
- [GRAMMAR] "We shall say this year, with exactly the same accents of relief and hope as our pagan ancestors used, and as the woaded savage used: 'The days will begin to lengthen now!'"  
- [SPELLING] "woaded" (likely a typo for "woe-stricken" or "woad-ed")  
- [SYNTAX] "We can explain the solstice. We are aware with absolute certitude that the solstice and the equinox and the varying phenomena of the seasons are due to the fact that the plane of the equator is tilted at a slight angle to the plane of the ecliptic."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "their remain, principles in confusion, great They absolutely and, moral spiritual, the that intact." is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "They forget that, after all the shattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind has still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence of an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this tremendous feat by the exercise of faith..." is a run-on sentence that disrupts the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the critique of modern skepticism to the philosophical reflection on the solstice and human existence is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "We shall say this year, with exactly the same accents of relief and hope as our pagan ancestors used, and as the woaded savage used: 'The days will begin to lengthen now!'" is unclear due to the vague reference to "woaded savage."  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the solstice and the structure of the Earth is disconnected from the previous discussion about Christmas and faith, making the overall structure feel disjointed.
