2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the section about Collier’s to the "CHAPTER: ENTER MR. HEARST" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different projects and assignments without clear chronological or thematic organization.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is incoherent and lacks a clear message or logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the section on Hearst’s International to the final paragraph is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the color request from Hearst is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the reader confused about the outcome.
