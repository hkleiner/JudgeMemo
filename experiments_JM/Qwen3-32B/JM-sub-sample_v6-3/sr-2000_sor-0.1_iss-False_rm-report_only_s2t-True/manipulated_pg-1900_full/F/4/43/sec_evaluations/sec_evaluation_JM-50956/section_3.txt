1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Still newly the 25th mentions earlier 15th Corps and were dispatched Reserve East formed Corps Reserve Ludendorf that to the Prussia." (awkward and grammatically incorrect phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But not in this alone was the role of Russia apparent in the trying days of October and November, 1914." (unusual and awkward sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the 2nd and 4th Cavalry Divisions. Still newly the 25th mentions earlier 15th Corps..." (confusing and unclear word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "i. e., a few days after this conversation..." (inconsistent use of punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "the Germans saved themselves on that occasion only by destroying the railroads back of them and by burning the bridges." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Still newly the 25th mentions earlier 15th Corps and were dispatched Reserve East formed Corps Reserve Ludendorf that to the Prussia." (confusing and illogical statement)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Warsaw battle to Ludendorf's account is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "the 2nd and 4th Cavalry Divisions. Still newly the 25th mentions earlier 15th Corps..." (unclear reference and lack of clarity in the sequence of events)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the battle of Warsaw to the broader strategic implications is not smoothly connected.  
- [LOGIC] "the Germans saved themselves on that occasion only by destroying the railroads back of them and by burning the bridges." (implies a logical inconsistency in the narrative)
