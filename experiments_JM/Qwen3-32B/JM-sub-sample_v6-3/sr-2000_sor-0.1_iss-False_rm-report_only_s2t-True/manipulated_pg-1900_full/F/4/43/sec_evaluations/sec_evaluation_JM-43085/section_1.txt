- [GRAMMAR] "The mere sight of a picture often takes our attention from our serious duties."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing Meissonier's early life to a confusing paragraph about "the long time fairy principal" that appears to be a corrupted or incoherent passage.
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "the long time fairy principal" lacks logical connection to the rest of the text and appears to be a non-sequitur.
- [CLARITY] The corrupted paragraph "The long time fairy principal..." is completely incoherent and makes no logical sense in the context of the biography.
