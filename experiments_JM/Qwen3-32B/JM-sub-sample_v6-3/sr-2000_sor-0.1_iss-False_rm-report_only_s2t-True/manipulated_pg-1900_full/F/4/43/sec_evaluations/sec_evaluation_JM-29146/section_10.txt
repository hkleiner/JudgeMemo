Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Millions of of, normal the colonists them worlds for space."
- [GRAMMAR] "You 'Earth Ramseygo back n't said ca," I to."
- [SPELLING] "insulined" (likely should be "insulated")
- [SPELLING] "neck on rose his hackles" (likely should be "rose his hackles on his neck")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Mystic is like experience always that."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey tackling Margot to Garr Symm running into the black box with little explanation of how this happened
- [LOGIC] Confusing transition from the physical confrontation to Ramsey hearing a growl from the box
- [CLARITY] Unclear explanation of Vardin's role and the nature of the "equation" that created god-like men
- [STRUCTURE] The ending is abrupt and disjointed, especially with the last line "Earth Ramseygo back n't said ca," I to."
- [TRANSITION] Poor transition between the physical world and the abstract concepts of time and matter-transmission

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
