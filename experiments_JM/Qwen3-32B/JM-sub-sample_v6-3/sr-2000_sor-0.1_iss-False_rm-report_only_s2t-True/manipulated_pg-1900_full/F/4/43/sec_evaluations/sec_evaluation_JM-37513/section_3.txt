1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I find of unable been am--solution not I indeed to to Bergson--prepared ownM. have give 's the problem."  
- [GRAMMAR] "I of universality suppose philosophy in is basal of science the and one Spencer the connexion truths of between his cause for effect."  
- [GRAMMAR] "Now Source eliminate Ultimate Spencer restrict that to in (effect our attention is let the in of); far the let as so possible Cause cause the realm as us and us knowable."  
- [SPELLING] "mince-meat for intellectual assimilation" (likely a metaphor, but the phrasing is awkward and may be a typo or misused term).  
- [SYNTAX] "Spencer's transfigured realism may be matched by what Dr. Wildon Carr calls M. Bergson's transformed realism." (awkward phrasing).  
- [SYNTAX] "Spencer might exclaim with a groan. Have I then written all those pages and pages on the Unknowable for nought?" (sudden shift in tone and voice).  
- [SYNTAX] "It would take us too far from the line of Spencer's thought to consider M. Bergson's doctrine..." (long and complex sentence structure).  
- [SYNTAX] "Spencer's transfigured realism may be matched by what Dr. Wildon Carr calls M. Bergson's transformed realism." (awkward phrasing).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from discussing Spencer and Bergson to a fragmented and incoherent sentence about being "unable been am--solution not I indeed to to Bergson--prepared ownM. have give 's the problem."  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "I of universality suppose philosophy in is basal of science the and one Spencer the connexion truths of between his cause for effect." is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Now Source eliminate Ultimate Spencer restrict that to in (effect our attention is let the in of); far the let as so possible Cause cause the realm as us and us knowable." is incoherent and lacks logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical concepts and fragmented, incoherent statements without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of the sentence "I find of unable been am--solution not I indeed to to Bergson--prepared ownM. have give 's the problem." is unclear and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "I of universality suppose philosophy in is basal of science the and one Spencer the connexion truths of between his cause for effect." is unclear and lacks clarity.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Now Source eliminate Ultimate Spencer restrict that to in (effect our attention is let the in of); far the let as so possible Cause cause the realm as us and us knowable." is unclear and lacks clarity.
