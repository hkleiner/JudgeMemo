Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Rather, are they reciprocal features of one coherent global programme." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "One is invited by scholarly authority to ponder the weight that should be given, variously, to paternal abuse..."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Failure to meet the challenge of such submission has manifested itself with especially devastating consequences throughout the centuries in betrayal..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract or complex terms without clear context, e.g., "the hard-won covenants of peace and reconciliation"  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling; not an error per se, but may be inconsistent with expected style)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing historical figures of evil to the concept of spiritual disease without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The section moves between abstract philosophical ideas and concrete examples without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the argument, e.g., "Failure to meet the challenge of such submission has manifested itself with especially devastating consequences throughout the centuries in betrayal..."  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the discussion of Covenant-breaking to the broader implications for the Bahá'í community  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the "community of interest" and the "most demanding issue facing humankind" is not clearly articulated  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
