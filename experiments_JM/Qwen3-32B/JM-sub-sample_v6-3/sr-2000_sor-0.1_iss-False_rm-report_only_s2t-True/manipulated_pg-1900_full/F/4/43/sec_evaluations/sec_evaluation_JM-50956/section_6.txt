Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "This society estimates the losses at 9½ million, exclusive of prisoners. As 2½ million shown there, were have we prisoners above." (awkward and ungrammatical phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "These upon, the those figures at, with based agree the by Studying Consequences 'Copenhagen arrived War statistics for the of official Society.'" (incoherent and syntactically incorrect)  
- [SPELLING] "comprize" (incorrect spelling; should be "comprise")  
- [LEXICON] "the small number of crippled who were no longer fit for service at the front nor for service out of the ranks" (awkward phrasing and unclear word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Russia's Losses--12,000,000" (em dashes used inconsistently and disrupt flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Thus there can be no doubt but that the number of Russian casualties was not less than 12,000,000..." (sudden shift in tone and logic after a confusing sentence)  
- [STRUCTURE] The section transitions abruptly from military operations to casualty statistics without clear signposting or logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] "These upon, the those figures at, with based agree the by Studying Consequences 'Copenhagen arrived War statistics for the of official Society.'" (nearly incomprehensible and disrupts the logical progression)  
- [TRANSITION] The conclusion section begins abruptly with "From this brief outline may be seen..." without a smooth transition from the preceding statistics.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text oscillates between detailed statistical analysis and broad historical claims without clear integration.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
