Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I at duties begin to forget I that one shall reported the morning school my building August as never superintendent."  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (This line is not part of the text to evaluate, but the sentence structure in the text is similar in problematic form.)  
- [SYNTAX] "him: THE on--large CHAPTER a their accompany" (Fragmented and incoherent sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "co√∂perative" (Non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "He like, 'We a family feel said here." (Incorrect word order and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "I had heard of him before--how he considered the superintendent nothing more than a boss whom he must endure." (Awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing school activities to a business trip and unrelated anecdotes about a factory president and janitor.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the discussion of school activities to the business trip is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the janitor is confusing and does not clearly connect to the previous discussion about school activities.  
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between the different topics (e.g., from school activities to a business trip and then to the janitor).  
- [STRUCTURE] The final sentence about the janitor is incomplete and does not conclude the narrative effectively.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
