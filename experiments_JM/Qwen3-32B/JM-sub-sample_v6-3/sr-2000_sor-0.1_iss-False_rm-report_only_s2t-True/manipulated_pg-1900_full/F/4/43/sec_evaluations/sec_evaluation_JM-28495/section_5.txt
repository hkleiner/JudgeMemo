2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative abruptly shifts from Excalibur's experiences to a detailed conversation between Eileen and the curate with no clear connection to the previous events.  
- [CLARITY] The dialogue between Eileen and the curate is coherent in itself but lacks a clear link to the earlier sections about Excalibur, creating a disjointed reading experience.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the humorous and episodic adventures of Excalibur to the serious and introspective dialogue is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative bridge.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift in tone and subject from Excalibur's perspective to the human characters' personal struggles is jarring and not well-justified within the narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
