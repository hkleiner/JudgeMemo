- [SPELLING] "finishedon" (misspelled word)  
- [SYNTAX] "the threw cañon upon of--wild day-thewhen 's sun work--cat certain mark side the 's was wall western the a mark hole the" (awkward and incoherent phrasing)

- [PUNCTUATION] "the threw cañon upon of--wild day-thewhen 's sun work--cat certain mark side the 's was wall western the a mark hole the, the finishedon was a it." (misuse of dashes and commas)

- [LOGIC] "They had shadow and the threw cañon upon of--wild day-thewhen 's sun work--cat certain mark side the 's was wall western the a mark hole the, the finishedon was a it." (nonsensical and disconnected from the narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph containing the fragmented sentence disrupts the flow and logical progression of the story.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "the threw cañon upon of--wild day-thewhen 's sun work--cat certain mark side the 's was wall western the a mark hole the" is unclear and lacks meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Jim's work to the incoherent paragraph is abrupt and jarring.
