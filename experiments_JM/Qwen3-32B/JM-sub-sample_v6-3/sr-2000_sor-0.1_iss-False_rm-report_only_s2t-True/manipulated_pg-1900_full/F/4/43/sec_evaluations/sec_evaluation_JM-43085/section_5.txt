(This sentence is grammatically incoherent and unreadable.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Not he already four catalogued did Franco in in of (Prussian hundred, pictures of war in were), number he 1886 campaign part took Italian prodigious the a only but and 1859-the paint!" (This sentence is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity.)  
- [SYNTAX] "He himself has related, with a delightful sense of humour, the machiavelian intrigues to which he resorted in order to secure the Emperor's consent to pose." (The sentence is long and could be more clearly structured.)  
- [LEXICON] "You can understand how essential it was for me to have the Emperor give me a sitting, if only for five minutes." (The word "sitting" is used in a technical sense that may be unclear to some readers.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The section on Meissonier's military paintings is well-structured, but the paragraph about his honors and awards is confusing and lacks logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph beginning with "Commander was two active at 1855..." is disjointed and does not follow the narrative structure of the rest of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Not he already four catalogued did Franco in in of (Prussian hundred, pictures of war in were), number he 1886 campaign part took Italian prodigious the a only but and 1859-the paint!" is unclear and disrupts the flow of the text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on genre paintings to the military paintings is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.
