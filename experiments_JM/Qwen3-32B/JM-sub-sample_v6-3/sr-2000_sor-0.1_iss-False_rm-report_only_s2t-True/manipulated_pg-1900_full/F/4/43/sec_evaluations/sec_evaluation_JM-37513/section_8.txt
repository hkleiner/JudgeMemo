Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward or ungrammatical sentence structures, e.g., "In a sense, then, the whole solar system is known by the earth as it swings in its orbit."  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement errors, e.g., "In the one uniform 'velocity virtue at it', would inheritance its continue from in of past direction."  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling errors, e.g., "in of past direction" instead of "in the direction of the past."  
- [LEXICON] Use of overly complex or ambiguous vocabulary that hinders clarity, e.g., "gravitative knowledge," "cognitive relatedness."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or misplaced punctuation, e.g., in the sentence: "In the one uniform 'velocity virtue at it', would inheritance its continue from in of past direction."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are not clearly connected to the main thesis, e.g., the discussion of the earth's motion and gravitational knowledge seems tangential to the main topic of cognition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract concepts and concrete examples without clear transitions, e.g., from the billiard ball to the earth's orbit.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of key terms is not consistently defined, e.g., "cognitive relatedness," "gravitative knowledge," leading to confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between ideas without sufficient explanation or linking, e.g., from the discussion of awareness to the mention of Bertrand Russell.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Some statements are repeated or rephrased without adding new information, e.g., the repeated emphasis on the dependency of cognitive processes on physiological and physico-chemical processes.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
