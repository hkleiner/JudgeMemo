Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It Symm Garr was's voice" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "insulined" (likely a misspelling of "insulated")  
- [SYNTAX] "It was not possible to die from lack of air or from cold on a world without the time continuum" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "scaly green face of the Irwadi" (unclear or inconsistent terminology)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "Ramsey hit the first one in the belly and darted back. His fist felt contact with the soft bulk of the insulined suit, then with the harder bulk of the man."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey's vision to the arrival of new figures without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Confusing sequence of events when describing the confrontation with the space-suited figures  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the Irwadi" without clear identification  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the mystical vision to the physical confrontation  
- [CONSISTENCY] Inconsistent explanation of how death is possible in a timeless world
