Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "run like clock work" (missing "work" should be "clockwork")  
- [GRAMMAR] "There are no doctors left in this small town and she had been brought..." (awkward phrasing and tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could not imagine for a moment what it was, so little did I expect..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Hôpital Central is beautifully located in a high valley just outside of Bar-le-Duc and looks like a new mining town." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "They are fine targets for taubes and I can’t think why they are not painted brown." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The infirmière major, Mlle. de Sézilles, and the médicin chef walked me through..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had not wanted to show me the hospital, even although I had brought..." ("even although" is non-standard phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would smile at hearing himself called a rich man to-day." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There are so many kind hearts and intelligent minds among the readers of a newspaper like the Times..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing a woman in a hospital to the broader context of French nobility and their financial struggles.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the woman's personal story to the general description of the hospital and its surroundings is abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the woman's personal story and the broader narrative about French hospitals is not clearly established.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the woman's condition to the description of the hospital layout and then to the French nobility's financial situation without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph shifts abruptly from describing the French nobility to an appeal to the readers of the Times, with little connection to the preceding content.
