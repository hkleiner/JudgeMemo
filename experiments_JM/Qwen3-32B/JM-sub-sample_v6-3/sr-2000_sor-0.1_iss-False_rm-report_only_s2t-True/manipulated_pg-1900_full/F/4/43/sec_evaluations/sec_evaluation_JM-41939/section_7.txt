Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Her age was not betrayed in any of her works, which had the appearance of having been painted in the flood-tide of youth." – Awkward phrasing and unclear use of "flood-tide of youth."  
- [SYNTAX] "contrary to her habit, she sent to the Salon." – Missing preposition ("to the Salon" should be "to the Salon" but the phrase is syntactically incomplete without context).  
- [LEXICON] "a congestion of the lungs prostrated her suddenly" – "prostrated" is an unusual and somewhat archaic word choice in this context.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing her artistic achievements to her sudden death is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the cortège and public reaction is well-structured, but the shift from her death to the tribute is slightly disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity" – "concert of regrets" is a metaphor that may be unclear to some readers.  
- [TRANSITION] The connection between her death and the public tribute is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
