Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the the" (repetition of article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "might of choice Wine the the and unsealed fingers with power" (nonsensical phrasing, likely a typo or corruption)  
- [SPELLING] "Qur'án" (inconsistent spelling with "Qur'án's" later; should be consistent)  
- [SYNTAX] "So it has been throughout all of the religious dispensations..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Mendicancy, slavery, autocracy, conquest, ethnic prejudices and other undesirable features of social interaction have gone unchallenged--or been explicitly indulged--as religion sought to achieve reformations..." (awkward and confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh" (inconsistent capitalization or formatting in some instances)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh's" (missing apostrophe in some instances)  
- [SPELLING] "Qur'án's" (inconsistent with "Qur'án" earlier)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh's" (missing apostrophe in some instances)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá'u'lláh's" (missing apostrophe in some instances)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Mendicancy, slavery, autocracy, conquest, ethnic prejudices and other undesirable features of social interaction have gone unchallenged--or been explicitly indulged--as religion sought to achieve reformations..." (confusing logic and unclear connection between ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing punishment in sacred texts to the role of religion in social reform is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "So it has been throughout all of the religious dispensations..." (vague and lacks clear reference to what "it" refers to)  
- [LOGIC] "The issue is not the past, but the implications for the present." (sudden shift in focus without sufficient explanation)  
- [LOGIC] "The exigencies of the new age of human experience to which Bahá'u'lláh summoned the political and religious rulers..." (complex sentence structure makes it difficult to follow the main idea)  
- [LOGIC] "Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, We, have rather might of choice Wine the the and unsealed fingers with power." (nonsensical and breaks the logical flow of the text)  
- [LOGIC] "Through His revelation, the principles required for the collective coming of age of the human race have been invested with the one power capable of penetrating to the roots of human motivation and of altering behaviour." (vague and lacks clear connection to previous ideas)
