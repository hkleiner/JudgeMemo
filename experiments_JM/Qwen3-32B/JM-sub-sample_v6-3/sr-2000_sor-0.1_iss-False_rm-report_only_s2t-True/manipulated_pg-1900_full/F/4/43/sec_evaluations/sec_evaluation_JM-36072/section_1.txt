- [LOGIC] "The linked are his and caricature side to message men his great; who by and, not epigoni age weakest is, make his man it great his ridiculous." (incoherent and unclear)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from abstract historical analysis to detailed descriptions of English society without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The garden each like a street typical modern, a it allotments a open, up village small of with field, round divided an was and cottages area." (confusing and lacks clarity)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Industrial Revolution to the description of pre-industrial English society is abrupt and lacks logical connection.
