- [LOGIC] The sentence "In with the letter sought importance earlier we Tangutans which the and Kanchenp'u opportunities had, nomadic many for to assuring myself the of introduction of escort of vain Khirgis in of promised and Kalmucks visits, paid I during other tribes." is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from describing the journey to a confusing, disconnected sentence about the letter and previous visits.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "About km a sharply the height, the considerable us hills a from around crossed we eleven defined guardhouse rose and to crest." is unclear and lacks logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the journey to the monastery is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
