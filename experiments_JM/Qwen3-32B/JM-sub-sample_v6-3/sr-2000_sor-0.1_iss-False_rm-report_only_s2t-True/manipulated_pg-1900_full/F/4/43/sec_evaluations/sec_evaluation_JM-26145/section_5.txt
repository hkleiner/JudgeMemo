2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "His send move same at next and each her to a was son Teye letter the time" is incoherent and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the letter to Teye to the discussion of Tushrattaâ€™s actions is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "He gave polite greetings from his wife Yuni to the widow, whose influence was evidently still strong, sent her presents, and entreated her intercession" is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the letter to the discussion of Mitani messengers and embassies is abrupt and lacks smooth transition.
