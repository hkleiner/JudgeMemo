1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Still others in of her listened her slippers for hand she sounds holding awake" is grammatically incorrect and incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "Chair-courtyard bear forth bearers those came her within the journeys upon to" is grammatically incorrect and incoherent.
- [SYNTAX] "From over a mysterious the groping expression from strings after the wandering came blind of some walls musician" has awkward and confusing syntax.
- [SPELLING] "intricate lacery" should likely be "intricate latticework" or similar.
- [SYNTAX] "It vibrated on the heart of Kuei Ping, calling her beyond the confines of the compound she had entered as a bride two months earlier" has awkward phrasing.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from Kuei Ping's wedding to her sneaking out of the compound at night with little transitional context.
- [STRUCTURE] The final sentence "Chair-courtyard bear forth bearers those came her within the journeys upon to" is disconnected from the rest of the narrative and lacks clarity.
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Square across the entrance gateway, placed so that evil spirits flying in to bring disaster would be flung back" is confusing in its structure and meaning.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the wedding feast to Kuei Ping's nighttime exploration is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph begins with a poetic description of moonlight but ends with an incoherent sentence that breaks the flow.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
