1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Bishop Luidhard, whose name should always be linked with that of St. Augustine, appears to have died soon after the arrival of Pope Gregory's mission, and his remains were eventually placed in a golden chest in the church of Saints Peter and Paul, afterwards St. Augustine's." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The zeal and enthusiasm of the band of missionaries began to bring in many converts." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome and to shake itself free from monasticism and the various forms of idolatrous worship which grew up in the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church;" (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association of Canterbury with ecclesiastical control, for if in the slow grinding of the wheels of Time there should cease to be a State Church in this land, the organization of the churches holding to the Elizabethan form of worship will no doubt continue to be centred and focussed at Canterbury." (run-on sentence and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Even if it were possible to state that parts of the walls were Roman, it would not be an easy matter to say whether the building were older than the two early Christian churches of North Cornwall, preserved through the ages by the drifting sand of that exposed coastline;" (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "When the site, about halfway between St. Martin's and St. Augustine's, was excavated in 1901, it was found to possess a nave about 47 feet long by 26 feet wide, with an apsidal chancel nearly the same width and depth separated from the nave by four Roman columns, and Mr. W.H. St. John Hope, of the Society of Antiquaries, who carried out the operations with Canon Routledge, has suggested that this may be the first church built by Augustine out of Roman materials ready to hand, while the larger one, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, a little to the west, was slowly being constructed." (run-on sentence and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Archbishop victorious Alphege way killed Danes in gave excesses, and by the was at drunken brutal carried, who Greenwich their fashion off to prisoner." (completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence "Archbishop victorious Alphege way killed Danes in gave excesses, and by the was at drunken brutal carried, who Greenwich their fashion off to prisoner." is completely incoherent and disrupts the logical flow of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple topics (e.g., the history of churches, the conversion of Ethelbert, the Danes' attack) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "But and of year their, landed this that the in trusted a 597 Christianizing, a, be--famous for found topographical of for in the of had Ebbsfleet Augustine--England Bede on detail Saxon, where landmark previously may island character Horsa if the haven Hengist vessels." is completely unclear and disrupts the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The text references events and figures (e.g., Ethelbert, Augustine, St. Martin's) without always providing sufficient context for a reader unfamiliar with the subject.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of the churches to the Danes' attack is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
