- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about the narrator becoming a pupil feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
- [CLARITY] The final lines "Wherein the narrator becomes Kuei Pingâ€™s pupil..." are confusing and lack context.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping's life story to the narrator's experience is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
