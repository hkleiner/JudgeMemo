Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Near Confederate’ spirited, Burgess Mill engagement was took heavy a opposition and met place."  
- [SYNTAX] "The failure of Union Generals Hancock of the II Corps and Warren of the V Corps to coordinate the efforts of their respective columns..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Confederate’" (incorrect possessive form)  
- [SYNTAX] "The slackening of hostile action was used to good advantage by Union and Confederate alike..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The enlisted men of both armies, however, remained largely unaware of the strategy of their commanders." (redundant phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed battle descriptions and broader historical context without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about "special artists" is inserted abruptly and is not clearly connected to the preceding or following content.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "The failure of Union Generals Hancock of the II Corps and Warren of the V Corps to coordinate the efforts of their respective columns..." is confusing due to its length and structure.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Battle of Hatcher’s Run to the daily life of soldiers lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the "special artists" feels disconnected from the broader narrative of the campaign.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
