2) Coherence Issues:

- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical references, literary analysis, and abstract philosophical ideas without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph is confusing and lacks a clear progression of ideas, especially with the sentence about "National false nations to missions become are false when only them."  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of national missions to the final philosophical conclusion is abrupt and lacks logical connection.
