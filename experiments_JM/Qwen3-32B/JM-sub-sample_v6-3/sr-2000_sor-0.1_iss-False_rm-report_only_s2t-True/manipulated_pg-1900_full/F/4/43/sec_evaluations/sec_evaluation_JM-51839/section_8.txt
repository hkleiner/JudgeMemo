Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "He Oak Grove buried is in cemetery" (subject-verb agreement and word order issues)
- [SPELLING] "Nacogdoches school board" (missing apostrophe in "school board's")
- [SYNTAX] "The sum allocated by the board has been used discreetly" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "new window frames and panes with new lumber added supporting the antiquated structure" (awkward and unclear phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "Let us be awakened to this opportunity" (unusual and awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from historical information about El Camino Real to Masonic Lodge to Texas' Monument to a Great Empresario to Old Nacogdoches University Building without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about rebuilding the university building feels disconnected from the preceding historical content
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the text is unclear - it appears to be a collection of historical facts without a unifying theme or narrative
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the different chapters or sections of the text
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear introduction or conclusion that would help frame the content

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
