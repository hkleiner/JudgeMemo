- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Veronese's death and legacy feels disconnected from the preceding detailed discussion of his works.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Veronese the remaining to privilege had rare young of end the" is incoherent and disrupts the narrative flow.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Veronese's international fame to his death is abrupt and lacks logical connection.
