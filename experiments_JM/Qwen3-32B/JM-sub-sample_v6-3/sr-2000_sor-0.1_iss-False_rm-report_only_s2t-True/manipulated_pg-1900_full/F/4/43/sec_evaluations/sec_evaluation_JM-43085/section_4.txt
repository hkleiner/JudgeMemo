Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The was artist all ideal with fully and at by had admirably, this command resources time his imbued his." (This sentence is grammatically incoherent and unreadable.)  
- [SPELLING] "bigness" (used in a context that may be unconventional or possibly a typo, though it could be intentional.)  
- [SYNTAX] "The arrangement of the milieu, the scrupulous devotion to realism that we noted in the opening lines of this study, the prodigious anxiety to give to every one of his personages such play of physiognomy, such expression, glance, and gesture as would best reveal their character and help us to know them better,--all these things combine and harmonize to produce an effect of remarkable power." (Cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure.)  
- [LEXICON] "individual bigness" (awkward phrasing that may confuse the reader.)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The arrangement of the milieu, the scrupulous devotion to realism that we noted in the opening lines of this study, the prodigious anxiety to give to every one of his personages such play of physiognomy, such expression, glance, and gesture as would best reveal their character and help us to know them better,--all these things combine and harmonize to produce an effect of remarkable power." (Misuse of em dash and lack of clarity in punctuation.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] "The was artist all ideal with fully and at by had admirably, this command resources time his imbued his." (This sentence disrupts the logical flow of the text and is incoherent.)  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the discussion of Meissonier's artistic development to the quote from Th√©ophile Gautier is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "The arrangement of the milieu, the scrupulous devotion to realism that we noted in the opening lines of this study..." (Reference to "the opening lines of this study" is unclear without the full context.)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of Meissonier's success to the detailed analysis of "A Smoker" is not smoothly connected.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The was artist all ideal with fully and at by had admirably, this command resources time his imbued his" is not logically connected to the surrounding text and appears to be a fragment or error.
