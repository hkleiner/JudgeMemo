- [LOGIC] The reference to "the his additional easy became become Serbia the Roumania in, weak prey only, will trophies nations as and to just past Belgium War enemy" is incoherent and does not logically connect to the rest of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the previous section to the current one is abrupt and lacks a clear logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "Ostrich politics" is not clearly explained, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.
