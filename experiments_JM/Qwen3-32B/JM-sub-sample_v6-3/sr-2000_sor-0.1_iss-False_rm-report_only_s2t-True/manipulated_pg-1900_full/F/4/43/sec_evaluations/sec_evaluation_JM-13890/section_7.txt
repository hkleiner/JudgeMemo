1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It of had the had a. amount been nave be, taken rebuilding fitting IV his the considerable here in and that liberal for interest he, of in Henry financial was buried should aid." (fragmented and ungrammatical sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "The effigies of Henry and his second wife, Joan of Navarre, are believed to be faithful representations." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SYNTAX] "One window contains old glass, and in the centre of the floor is placed the chair of Purbeck marble in which the Archbishops are enthroned." (awkward structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "As it is no longer considered as old as the days of Augustine the title St. Augustine's Chair must be regarded as a figure of speech." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "It of had the had a. amount been nave be, taken rebuilding fitting IV his the considerable here in and that liberal for interest he, of in Henry financial was buried should aid." is incoherent and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Henry IV and the Black Prince is abruptly cut off and lacks a clear transition to the next section.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "CrÃ©cy" is unclear due to encoding issues, which may confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the tomb of Edward the Black Prince to the description of the windows in Trinity Chapel is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the windows in Trinity Chapel is well-structured, but the preceding paragraph about the tomb and effigies lacks a smooth transition.
