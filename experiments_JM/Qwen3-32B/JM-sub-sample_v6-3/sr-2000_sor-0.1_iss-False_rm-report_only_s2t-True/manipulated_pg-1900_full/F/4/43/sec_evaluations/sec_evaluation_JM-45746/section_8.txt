- [SYNTAX] "The high school of to-day is called upon to serve..." has awkward phrasing.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from discussing vocational guidance programs to a story about a parent criticizing the school, without clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the mayor's visit is disjointed and difficult to follow due to poor sentence structure.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about changing conditions in social and industrial life is vague and lacks specific examples to support the argument.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
