1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Wearing me of, and the first the, our of first Mr. how is where found at Mittineague Company, Paper and Company stone on apron Moses, that Strathmore occasion the meeting of units the Paper." (This sentence is grammatically incoherent and unreadable.)  
- [SYNTAX] "In my mind’s eye I can see Mr. Moses now as he entered from the corridor." (Awkward phrasing and structure.)  
- [SPELLING] "Mittineague" (Possibly a misspelling or incorrect name.)  
- [LEXICON] "Wearing me of, and the first the, our of first Mr. how is where found..." (Unnatural and confusing word choice.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Mr. Moses is abruptly cut off by an incoherent sentence, breaking the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Wearing me of, and the first the, our of first Mr. how is where found..." is unclear and disrupts the reader’s understanding.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the description of the Strathmore sample book to the incoherent sentence is jarring and unsmooth.  
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph lacks a clear connection between the description of the apron and the introduction of Mr. Moses.
