- [GRAMMAR] "Human feature process anticipation it readily, to 's appreciate is continue integrallong necessarily-- but nature being the can purifying that--Guardian maturation of community Bahá'í the one an will the what be of paradoxically this." (fragmented and grammatically incoherent)  
- [LEXICON] "The assertion that this community may already constitute the most diverse and geographically widespread of any similarly organized body of people on the planet is unlikely to be challenged by one familiar with the evidence." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "One will search in vain for another association of human beings in history--political, religious, or social--that has successfully survived the perennial blight of schism and faction." (awkward and overly complex phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Bahá'í community's growth is extremely disjointed and lacks a clear structure or logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Human feature process anticipation it readily, to 's appreciate is continue integrallong necessarily-- but nature being the can purifying that--Guardian maturation of community Bahá'í the one an will the what be of paradoxically this" is incoherent and fails to convey a clear idea.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the Bahá'í community's paradoxical nature is unclear and lacks a logical progression of ideas.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of the Bahá'í community's global presence to the final paragraph about the paradox of its maturation is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
