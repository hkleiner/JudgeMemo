Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was exasperating to think of the public spirit at Egypt, and contrast it with the state of things at Pleasant River." (should be "contrast *it* with" or "contrast *that* with")  
- [GRAMMAR] "so much so much so that fat old Mrs. Potter..." (repetition of "so much")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It would ’a’ be’n so mortified I believe I’d ’a’ said..." (dialectal phrasing is acceptable, but inconsistent with standard English)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I wo n’t there you shed, there you myround it int, hencoop the Mis ai..." (fragmented, incoherent sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "MisMis wo be’ Mis I, relation the’ you youand there sisters!”" (fragmented, incoherent sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The ever baby disfigured her for, but life escaped with was." (awkward and incorrect phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Her mother, partly to conceal her own wounded vanity, and partly to shield the timid, morbid child, kept her out of sight as much as possible" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Forty—that is rather old to be interesting, but age is a relative matter." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from Aunt Hitty’s planning of a funeral to Lyddy Butterfield’s backstory, with no clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The fragmented and incoherent dialogue at the end ("I wo n’t there you shed...") disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the funeral planning to Lyddy’s childhood accident is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Lyddy’s age and "language of passion" feels disconnected from the preceding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "He shall daily joy dispense..." at the start of Chapter IV is abrupt and lacks integration with the preceding text.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Lyddy month her Edgewood a property first had in few as owner during very callers" is incoherent and lacks clarity.
