Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The decision at which Millet p√®re had arrived was prompted by a drawing..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "certainly the young Millet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen..." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "betwixt" (archaic and uncommon word usage)  
- [LEXICON] "fervid admiration" (somewhat awkward collocation)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "He saw more good in frequenting the museums and making copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to the advice of his teacher."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Millet's early artistic development to his father's illness and return to the farm (lack of smooth transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Millet's artistic journey and personal life without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "The incompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike out in his own way" (vague reference to "these two men")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Millet's return to Cherbourg to his time in Paris without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on Delaroche and the academic style is dense and lacks clear progression  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
