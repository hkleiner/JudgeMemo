2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Not a commercial ago need were of long greatly in we teacher." is incoherent and disrupts the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "This to weeks me the extra work alone new and later two position I very to had was helpful my given worth proved." is incoherent and breaks the narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the young woman with "dress sense" is abruptly followed by a discussion of general education, creating a jarring shift in topic.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "One such has teachers be the chief usually of in found weaknesses of been to English." is unclear and disrupts the reader's understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on teacher qualifications to the anecdote about the young man seeking a promotion is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
