- [SPELLING] "which-every" (should be "which every")
- [SYNTAX] "To make this bald statement and omit to mention the ceremony attending it would be misleading; for not only were Henry I. and David of Scotland present, but Canterbury saw such a gathering of dignitaries of Church and State with their splendid retinues that the historian found nothing to compare with it but Solomon's dedication of the Temple!"
- [GRAMMAR] "Becket announced by who couch, and knights him friends was he his his conversation on shoulder dinner and the was to, seated just he talking, the whose with and pointedly had when monk sat four his continued leaning on were finished."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the description of the Norman cathedral to a disjointed paragraph about the city's development and then to Becket's murder without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Becket's murder is fragmented and lacks a clear narrative flow, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the knights' first interview with Becket is confusing and lacks clarity in describing the actions and dialogue.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the cathedral to the events surrounding Becket's murder is abrupt and lacks contextual connection.
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the city's development is incoherent and appears to be a jumbled collection of phrases without a clear message.
