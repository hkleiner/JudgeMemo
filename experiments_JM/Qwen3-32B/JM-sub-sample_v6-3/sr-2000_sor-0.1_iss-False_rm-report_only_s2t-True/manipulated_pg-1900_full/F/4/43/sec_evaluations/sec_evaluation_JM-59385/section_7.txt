Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Fuh Kueias twinkled he down humor Tang at eyes looked â€™s with Ping." (Fragmented and ungrammatical sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "Fuh Kueias" (Likely a typo or miswritten name)  
- [SYNTAX] "She read, too, in the repeated calls from his household for their return more than just the desire to enforce old traditions." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "Wherein there is patience and tenderness and understanding and a return to a little home village" (Stilted and poetic phrasing that disrupts flow)  
- [SYNTAX] "Wherein twenty-seven slow years are added one upon another" (Unnatural phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the procession to the poetic interlude ("Wherein there is patience...") is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between narrative and poetic interludes without clear transitions, disrupting the flow.  
- [CLARITY] The final poetic lines ("Wherein twenty-seven slow years are added one upon another") are vague and do not clearly connect to the preceding narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of Fuh Tang's death to the emotional aftermath is abrupt and lacks sufficient emotional buildup.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
