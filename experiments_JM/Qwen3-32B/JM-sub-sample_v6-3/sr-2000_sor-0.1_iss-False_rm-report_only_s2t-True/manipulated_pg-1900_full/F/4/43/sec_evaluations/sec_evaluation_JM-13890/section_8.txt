2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing the windows to the crypt and then to the undercroft, with no clear connection between these ideas.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph lacks a clear progression of ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's intent.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of the first paragraph is obscured by grammatical errors and incoherent phrasing.  
- [TRANSITION] There is no smooth transition between the first paragraph and the rest of the text, which discusses the crypt and historical context.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence is incoherent and fails to connect with the preceding content.
