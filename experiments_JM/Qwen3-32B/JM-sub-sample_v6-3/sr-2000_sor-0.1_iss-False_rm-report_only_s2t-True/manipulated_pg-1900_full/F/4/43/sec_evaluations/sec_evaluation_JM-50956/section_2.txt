- [GRAMMAR] "General: Sacrificethis march" (fragmented and ungrammatical)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the in defeat who Samsonov East designedly recital that of in fatal about General Samsonov days, German and to, of from Rennenkampf failed final command he three, this only that army--be Germans the--of the two forgotten within events, Russians 's with aid, on destroyed Russia two Ludendorf the 1914 should' commences Samsonov the, corps had of front was sonov."

- [SPELLING] "Roumania" (archaic spelling; modern spelling is "Romania")  
- [SPELLING] "demoralized" (misspelled as "undemoralized")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps of the first three years of the War, maps which speak only of two principal fronts, the French and the Russian, and no other--to grasp the significance..." (awkward phrasing with excessive dashes)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is difficult to understand how a serious-minded military leader can stoop to employ, in a supposedly serious work, methods fit for the yellow press, such as accusing Russian generals of treason, etc., etc." (awkward phrasing and repetition of "etc.")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia towards the end of the War are obscuring the true historic role of Russia in the sanguine World struggle." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "sanguine World struggle")  
- [SYNTAX] "It is just as simple to understand that during that period, when the enemy was most powerful and undemoralized, when he was operating with his best troops, that the most difficult and responsible part of the problem had to be performed." (awkward phrasing and repetition of "when")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It only statement never Russian six in his brought a corps 250,000 and that force or CHAPTER with under Prussia proved event." (incoherent and lacks logical connection to the rest of the text)  
- [LOGIC] "General: Sacrificethis march the in defeat who Samsonov East designedly recital that of in fatal about General Samsonov days, German and to, of from Rennenkampf failed final command he three, this only that army--be Germans the--of the two forgotten within events, Russians 's with aid, on destroyed Russia two Ludendorf the 1914 should' commences Samsonov the, corps had of front was sonov." (incoherent and lacks logical connection to the rest of the text)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from discussing the role of Russia in the war to a fragmented and incoherent section about General Samsonov and Ludendorf, then returns to a more coherent discussion.  
- [CLARITY] "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps of the first three years of the War, maps which speak only of two principal fronts, the French and the Russian, and no other--to grasp the significance..." (confusing and unclear phrasing)  
- [CLARITY] "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia towards the end of the War are obscuring the true historic role of Russia in the sanguine World struggle." (unclear reference to "sanguine World struggle")  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of Ludendorf's memoirs to the fragmented and incoherent section about General Samsonov is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the fragmented section back to the coherent discussion of the war is also abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
