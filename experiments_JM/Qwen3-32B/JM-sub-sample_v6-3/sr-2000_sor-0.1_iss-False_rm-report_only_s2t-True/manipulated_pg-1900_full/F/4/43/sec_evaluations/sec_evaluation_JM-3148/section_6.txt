2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Aunt Hitty's perspective to Lyddy's actions and then to her emotional response to music, with minimal transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of Lyddy's house-furnishing and her emotional transformation is somewhat disjointed from the earlier narrative about Aunt Hitty's observations.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of Anthony Croft and his music feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear transition from the previous section about Lyddy's home improvements.  
- [LOGIC] The inclusion of the poetic quotation at the end is somewhat disconnected from the narrative flow and lacks a clear integration into the story.  
- [CLARITY] The dialect and informal phrasing used by Aunt Hitty can make the narrative less clear and harder to follow for some readers.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Lyddy's emotional response to the music is somewhat abstract and lacks a clear progression of thought.  
- [CLARITY] The final poetic quotation is not clearly explained or connected to the narrative, making its inclusion somewhat confusing.
