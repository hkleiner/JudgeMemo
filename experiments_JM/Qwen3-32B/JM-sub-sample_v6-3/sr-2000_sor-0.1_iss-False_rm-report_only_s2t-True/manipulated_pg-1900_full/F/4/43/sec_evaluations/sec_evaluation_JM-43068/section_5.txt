Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "portrait he had whose painted" (word order error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "One from knew another was day to to what never going one happen" (fragmented and incoherent sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "Winnower" (should be "The Winnower" with "The")  
- [SYNTAX] "The struggle betwixt reaction and property on the one hand, and lawlessness and revolution on the other, was being waged with grim determination" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The issue was for long in the balance" (word choice could be clearer)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The year 1848 was not an encouraging one for a painter who was standing on the threshold of his career" (sudden shift in tone and focus without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] "One from knew another was day to to what never going one happen" (disrupts the logical flow of the paragraph)  
- [CLARITY] "He painted a portrait of the recently deceased mayor" (unclear how this connects to the broader narrative of Millet's artistic development)  
- [TRANSITION] "Meanwhile Millet was occupied with subjects which he thought would appeal to the general public" (sudden shift in focus without clear transition from the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "The Barbizon of 1850 was a very different place from the Barbizon of to-day" (confusing phrasing and unclear connection to the preceding section)
