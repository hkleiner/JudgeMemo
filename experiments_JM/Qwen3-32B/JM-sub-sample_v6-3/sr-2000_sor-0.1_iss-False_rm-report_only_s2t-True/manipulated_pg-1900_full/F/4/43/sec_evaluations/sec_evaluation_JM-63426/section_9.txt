- [GRAMMAR] "Before final retirement I managed to lay out a new Delineator, a new Sunday magazine for the Herald Tribune (about 1925), and a lay-out suggested by early New England news-sheets for the Yale Daily, and ... well, I guess thatâ€™s about all."
- [GRAMMAR] "But this is an age of lay-outs, and in this new photographic process with the use of photographic enlargements, there are possibilities for display composition of any required size, and great variety, presenting intriguing possibilities for the creative designer and typographer."

- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The connection between the author's personal experiences and the broader discussion of design opportunities is sometimes unclear.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as the one about the wire being written and sent.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Chicago conference to the author's later career and reflections is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The author's reflections on past and present design conditions are presented in a somewhat disjointed manner.
