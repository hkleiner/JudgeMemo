2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Unlooked-his to: ripen decorate needy friend company an, talent poverty Trimolet to a obtained artist windfall before time to in real for he had, with who his opportunity succumbed had fans." is incoherent and lacks logical progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph is a jumbled, fragmented sentence that fails to convey a clear idea or narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The transition from Meissonier's early struggles to his eventual success is abrupt and lacks sufficient explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Meissonier's illustrations to the final incoherent paragraph is jarring and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph appears to be a corrupted or incomplete sentence that does not logically follow from the preceding content.
