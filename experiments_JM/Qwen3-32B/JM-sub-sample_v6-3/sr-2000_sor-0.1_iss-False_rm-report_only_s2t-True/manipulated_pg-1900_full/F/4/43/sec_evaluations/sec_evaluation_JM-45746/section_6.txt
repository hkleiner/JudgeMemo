1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I all for to in well then closets, and the and put to an that the before and orderly he in had if manner, be it books we say reported some suggested the listened what supplies teachers might shelves arranged work."  
- [GRAMMAR] "He shelves mine his sure no good do was time, the that that would be and and would wasted."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The principal in the smaller school as well as in the larger must give greater attention to the use of intelligence tests as an aid in classifying the pupils so that they can be better graded according to their ability."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The use of tests and measurements has demonstrated the wide range of abilities that can usually be found in different pupils of the same grade."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The teacher with from thirty-five to forty-five pupils must handle the work of her room more or less in groups, which often fails to reach the retarded or the accelerated pupil."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The entire class suffers from such a procedure. It is unfair to the ninety per cent of pupils of average ability to have one fourth of the teacher's time given to the other ten per cent of the pupils in the room."  
- [GRAMMAR] "The 'ninety and nine' who 'can do' are more important to save than the one lost sheep who may never be able 'to do' if saved."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the janitor's cooperation to a discussion of teacher questionnaires and administrative practices without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on the janitor and the section on the principal's meetings with teachers are disjointed and lack a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph beginning with "I all for to in well then closets..." is incoherent and lacks logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the janitor's story to the discussion of the principal's meetings is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on the "exceptional child" is difficult to follow due to fragmented sentences and unclear reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "The use of tests and measurements has demonstrated the wide range of abilities that can usually be found in different pupils of the same grade" is confusing in its phrasing.
