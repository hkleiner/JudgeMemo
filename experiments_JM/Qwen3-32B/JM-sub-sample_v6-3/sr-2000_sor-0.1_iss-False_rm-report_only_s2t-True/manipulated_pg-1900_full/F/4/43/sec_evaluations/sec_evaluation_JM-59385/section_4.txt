1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It as that to told, feet return the waiting in where morrow Tang Ping flowers the Kuei scattered the the was of, their under blown that petals walked Fuh they he his magnolia upon must courtyard were bruised work."  
- [GRAMMAR] "Wherein memory she a of among Kuei and virtue time Ping crown is had the ’sthe a was of rejoicing people of son the born of great his is who known name the perpetuate her and would there"  
- [GRAMMAR] "This as to skirt and eyes that the back full for her fluttered white its room the a Kuei struggled Ping before of surroundings stiff foreign consciousness."  
- [SPELLING] "hutung" (possibly a non-standard term, but used in context)  
- [SYNTAX] "The in rich months were that followed happiness."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's internal thoughts to a disjointed description of Fuh Tang's final words, making the sequence confusing.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about the child's birth and the months that followed is abruptly cut off with "The in rich months were that followed happiness," which disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The final lines "Wherein memory she a of among Kuei and virtue time Ping crown is had the ’sthe a was of rejoicing people of son the born of great his is who known name the perpetuate her and would there" are incoherent and do not contribute to the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the birth of the child to the final lines is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
