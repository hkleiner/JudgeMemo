- [LOGIC] "At Sacrificing, of preparation, without the without Jeroboam a the coveted Fragonard, pupil with Idols being prize Academy his "and won to twenty." (nonsensical and disconnected from the narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from Fragonard's artistic training to political events (e.g., Damiens' assassination) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry..." (confusing explanation of artistic process)  
- [TRANSITION] "Meanwhile the quarrels between priests and parliaments had grown very bitter." (sudden shift to unrelated political context)  
- [LOGIC] "He escaped the taint of learning to see through the eyes of others..." (vague and abstract phrasing that disrupts narrative flow)
