- [SPELLING] "thebe"  
- [SPELLING] "favouritebe"  
- [SPELLING] "taketh" (archaic but not incorrect, but inconsistent with modern English)  
- [SYNTAX] "He that hath such friends, grave or gay, needeth not to care whether he be rich or poor..." (archaic phrasing that disrupts fluency in modern context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "He things restored is not a vain legacies come be or best is of say in, his can seems for also for the he to his has sold, family with if dream expended has be houses rich, when usury worst collection and gathering not thebe for I passing which conscience he to wronging may ever something anodynes their, which all for his make afflicted sons he his will?" is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "One been he has, at rascal so to him and present as he least and be present that, certain it and him a next birthday better to make his the and to bookman can in may a thing that believes to likes good, delightful it book order person when address himself it is show the man treasure he orders a that have sent remembered will perhaps loves—that own in one—day to." is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "For day hindrances his beating reads bookman the, Quixote for snowdrift his pleasure sleet with of in there morocco of is, Payne there March a because taketh no is the dearer Don the garden, more while and are he the—favouritebe day, of if, and if the on the—a certain colour relish _fireside the_ binding window ’s red be him is volume the weather a sunshine." is incoherent and lacks logical structure.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text contains several abrupt shifts in tone and structure, especially between the incoherent sentences and the more coherent, reflective passages.  
- [CLARITY] The archaic phrasing in some parts (e.g., "He that hath such friends...") disrupts the clarity and consistency of the narrative.
