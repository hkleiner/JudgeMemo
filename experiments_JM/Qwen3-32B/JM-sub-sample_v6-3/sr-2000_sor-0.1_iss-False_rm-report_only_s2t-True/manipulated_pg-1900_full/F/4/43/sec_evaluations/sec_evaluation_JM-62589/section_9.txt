2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the confrontation between Shirtliffe and Morley to the description of the environment without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph abruptly shifts to a new scene with "It’s Molly!" without clear connection to the previous narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The line "He’s connected was thought." is unclear and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The line "Another he; upright effort and time stood this." is confusing and does not logically follow the previous sentence.  
- [LOGIC] The line "The and making trees wind among the bleak gaunt swept them moan creak." is incoherent and does not contribute to the narrative.
