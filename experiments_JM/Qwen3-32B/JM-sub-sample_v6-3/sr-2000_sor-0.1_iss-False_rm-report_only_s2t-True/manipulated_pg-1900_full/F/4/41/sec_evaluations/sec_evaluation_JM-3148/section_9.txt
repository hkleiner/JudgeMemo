2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Lyddy’s emotional prayer to the next chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts from Lyddy’s internal monologue to a description of Davy’s recovery and Anthony’s life without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "praise our fructifying sun" is unclear and disrupts the flow of the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Lyddy’s emotional state to the description of Davy’s visits and Anthony’s violin playing lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Almira Berry and the melodeon feels disconnected from the previous emotional depth of Lyddy’s prayer.
