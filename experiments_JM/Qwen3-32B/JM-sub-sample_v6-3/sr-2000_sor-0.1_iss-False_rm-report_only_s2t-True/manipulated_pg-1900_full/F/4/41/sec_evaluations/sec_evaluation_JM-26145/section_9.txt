2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing Ugarit to the political conditions in the Tell el Amarna period without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences reference prior context (e.g., "Tushrattaâ€™s letters") without sufficient explanation for a reader unfamiliar with the full text.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references such as "the two may be identical with the king of Tana" lack clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., from letters to political conditions) disrupt the flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section is dense with historical references and lacks clear organization, making it difficult to follow the main narrative.
