2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and complex, with long, unbroken sentences that make it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or require prior knowledge to fully understand (e.g., references to Malory, Spenser, and specific literary works).  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts between discussing Tennyson's poetry, Victorian values, and broader historical and philosophical themes, sometimes without clear transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, especially when moving from one topic (e.g., Tennyson's views on morality) to another (e.g., the political and social disillusionment in *Locksley Hall*).
