2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing the dinner to the dance without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the "rigodon" dance is somewhat confusing due to the complexity of the figures being described without visual context.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative of the waltz and the author's partner is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the dance to the description of the Filipinos' attire is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from describing the attire to the economic and domestic life in the Philippines is not clearly connected.  
- [CLARITY] The explanation of the servant chain is somewhat confusing due to the rapid succession of events and unclear pronoun references.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Manila feels disconnected from the previous discussion of domestic life and servants.
