2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from literary analysis to a whimsical description of bookmen and their habits, with no clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The passage about bookmen and their rearranging of books is loosely connected to the earlier discussion of Scott and Thackeray, creating a disjointed narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of books as "famous people" is somewhat abstract and not clearly tied to the main theme.  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the ideal holiday feels abrupt and disconnected from the preceding content.
