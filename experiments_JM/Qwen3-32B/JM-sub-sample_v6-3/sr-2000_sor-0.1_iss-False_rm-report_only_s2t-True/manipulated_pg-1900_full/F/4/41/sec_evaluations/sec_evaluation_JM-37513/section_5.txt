- [LOGIC] Some arguments are introduced without sufficient explanation or context, making it difficult to follow the reasoning.  
- [CLARITY] The distinction between "ground," "cause," and "condition" is not consistently clarified, leading to ambiguity.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Spencer's ideas to broader philosophical questions is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the "primitive fire-mist" and its relation to modern scientific understanding is not clearly resolved or explained.
