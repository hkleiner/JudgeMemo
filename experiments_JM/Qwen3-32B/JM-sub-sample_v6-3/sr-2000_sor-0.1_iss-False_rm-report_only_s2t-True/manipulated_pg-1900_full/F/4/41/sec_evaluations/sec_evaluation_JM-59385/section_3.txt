2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts from the wedding ceremony to Kuei Ping's nighttime exploration without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Kuei Ping stepping outside the compound feels disconnected from the preceding wedding narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in Peking" is awkwardly inserted and disrupts the flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the wedding feast to Kuei Ping's nighttime wandering is abrupt and lacks logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new setting and action without sufficient setup or explanation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
