2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (e.g., Habiri, Sutu, Egyptian military, Babylonian letters) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are loosely connected, making the flow of ideas less clear (e.g., the shift from military expeditions to the behavior of Syrian and Canaanite officials).  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Nimmuria" and "Napkhutia" is confusing without prior context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the military section to the discussion of letters is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Kadashman-Beo" appears to be a typo, but it disrupts the logical flow of the text.
