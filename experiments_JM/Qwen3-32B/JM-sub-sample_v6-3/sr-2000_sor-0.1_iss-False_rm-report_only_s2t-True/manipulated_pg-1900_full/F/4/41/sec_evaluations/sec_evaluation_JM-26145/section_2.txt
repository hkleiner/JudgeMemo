2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from religious reform to administrative details of officials and then to the political situation in the provinces, with few transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Akhenaten’s religious reforms and the administrative and political issues in the provinces is not clearly explained.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as the one beginning with "The letters zfford abundant evidence..."  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the religious context to the discussion of tribute and Bedawìn tribes is abrupt and lacks logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of phrases like "The doctrine... was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypy" is unclear due to poor phrasing.
