- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on crime and punishment is dense and lacks clear segmentation, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain multiple clauses, reducing clarity and readability.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of historical religious practices to modern implications is abrupt and lacks sufficient explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the role of religion in shaping moral consciousness is occasionally weakened by the lack of clear cause-and-effect relationships.  
- [CLARITY] The use of archaic or poetic language (e.g., "The remedy the world needeth...") can obscure the meaning for some readers.
