2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping’s internal struggles to descriptions of the city and sunrise, with little transition.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Kuei Ping’s spiritual awakening and the mundane details of the city is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the poison of the poppy stilled into pleasantness the dreams of Fuh Tang" is vague and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping’s decision to leave to her journey and spiritual reflection is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift to the sunrise and the city waking up feels disconnected from the emotional and spiritual journey of the character.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the winds grew colder and winter came upon them" is repeated in a fragmented format, which disrupts the flow.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph, where Kuei Ping returns to her family, feels rushed and lacks a clear resolution to her internal conflict.
