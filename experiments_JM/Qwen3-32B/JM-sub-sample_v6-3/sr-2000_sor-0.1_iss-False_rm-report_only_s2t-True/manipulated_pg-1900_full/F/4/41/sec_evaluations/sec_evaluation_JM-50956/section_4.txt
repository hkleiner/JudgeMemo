- [LOGIC] "when the Russians had compelled them to have 43 divisions in the field, that is, to treble their forces on the Russian front, to the detriment of their Frenvh front" (awkward and unclear logical progression)  
- [CLARITY] "the Russian Army renderd the Allies, in the critical days of 1915, assistance that was not less important and serious than that of the days of the Marne and Ypres" (awkward phrasing and unclear comparison)  
- [CLARITY] "Russia, by diverting upon herself, towards the close of 1914, all the efforts of the Central Powers, thereby offered France and England the opportunity for a whole yesr to prepare for the prosecution of the War" (awkward phrasing and unclear connection)  
- [CLARITY] "the true ally, Russia, certainly aided by diverting upon herselfvall the German reserves in 1915 and giving the Allies a whole year of respite in whicu to create new armed forces" (awkward phrasing and unclear connection)  
- [CLARITY] "Not one single German operation in France could obtain full development, and inevitably spent itself just because of lack of reserves which were always opportunelymswallowed by the Russian front" (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)
