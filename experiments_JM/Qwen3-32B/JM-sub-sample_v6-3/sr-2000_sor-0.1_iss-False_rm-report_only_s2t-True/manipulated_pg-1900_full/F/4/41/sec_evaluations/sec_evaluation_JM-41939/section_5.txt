2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts in narrative focus from the Legion of Honour ceremony to the Universal Exposition of 1867 without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the art school is inserted as a parenthesis, which disrupts the chronological flow of the narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Muss Rosa Bonheur" is unclear without context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the art school to her installation at By is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the war of 1870 appears at the end without a clear link to the preceding content.
