2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Fragonard's artistic development to political events involving the king and Damiens.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Damiens' assassination of the king is abrupt and not clearly connected to Fragonard's story.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Fragonard's time in Rome to his artistic awakening is somewhat abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "Rome was not his grave" is metaphorical and may be confusing without context.  
- [LOGIC] The explanation of Boucher's advice is somewhat unclear and lacks a clear connection to Fragonard's artistic development.
