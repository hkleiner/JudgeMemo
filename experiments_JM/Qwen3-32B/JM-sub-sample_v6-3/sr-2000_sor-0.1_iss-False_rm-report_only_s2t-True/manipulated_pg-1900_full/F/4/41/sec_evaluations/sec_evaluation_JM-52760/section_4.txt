2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from technical details of the mine to the battle plan and troop movements without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences reference events or decisions (e.g., Burnsideâ€™s last-minute changes) without sufficient context for clarity.  
- [CLARITY] The timeline of events is occasionally confusing due to abrupt shifts in focus.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the mine to the explosion and its aftermath is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph ends mid-sentence ("Meanwhile, the lot of the Northern soldiers was rapidly becoming unbearable.") without resolution.
