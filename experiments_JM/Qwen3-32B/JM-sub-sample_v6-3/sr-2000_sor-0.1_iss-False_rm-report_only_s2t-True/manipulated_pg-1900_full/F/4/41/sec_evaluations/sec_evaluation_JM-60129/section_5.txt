2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing the journey to detailed architectural descriptions without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some descriptions of the monastery and its surroundings are repetitive and lack clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally lacks clarity in describing spatial relationships (e.g., "the central square connecting these four buildings, which lack their inner walls").  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between the description of the monastery and the religious practices of the lamas.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the YÃ¶gur lamas and their practices feels disconnected from the preceding architectural descriptions.
