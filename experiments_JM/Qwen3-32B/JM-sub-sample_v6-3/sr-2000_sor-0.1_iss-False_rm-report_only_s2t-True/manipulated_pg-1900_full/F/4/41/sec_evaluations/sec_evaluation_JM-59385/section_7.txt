- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's internal reflections to descriptions of the procession and then to the future.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or lack clear referents, such as "the real contrast between him and the handsome gallant man."  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping's reflections to the description of the procession is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The meaning of the repeated lines "Wherein... home village" and "Wherein... twenty-seven slow years" is unclear and disrupts the narrative flow.
