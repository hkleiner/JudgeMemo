2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a list of events in chronological order, which is coherent in structure, but lacks transitions between entries.  
- [CLARITY] Some entries are very brief and lack context, making it difficult to understand the significance of certain events.  
- [LOGIC] The repetition of the year 1890 and 1954 without clear distinction between the events is slightly confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Mr. Bradley’s early life is disconnected from the preceding list of events and feels like an abrupt addition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
