- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or require inference, such as "the figure in the carpet traceable or describable only for husbands and wives."

- [LOGIC] The sudden introduction of Drayton Deane and his role in reviewing the book is not clearly explained in the context of the current section.
