2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and complex, with long sentences that may obscure the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are abstract or vague, such as "the cumulative learning of the ages" and "the true Physician is debarred from administering the remedy," which may hinder clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the critique of materialism to the discussion of global integration is abrupt and lacks a clear connecting thread.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Bahá'í perspective to the broader implications of global integration is not smoothly executed.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces the topic of mass migration and refugees but ends abruptly without completing the thought or connecting it to the broader theme.
