2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] The final section about the narrator becoming a student of Kuei Ping feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative
- [CLARITY] The ending is abrupt and confusing, with the phrase "Wherein the narrator becomes Kuei Ping’s pupil and is filled with wondering questions and is witness to a dream come true in its threefold parts" that doesn't clearly connect to the preceding text
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping's life story to the narrator's experience is abrupt and lacks context
