2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple topics (literature, religion, social class, imperialism) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some ideas are introduced abruptly and not fully explained (e.g., "the worst that can be said of it is that it encouraged a temper of sentimental brutalism").  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of certain phrases is ambiguous or unclear (e.g., "the answer depends on yourselves").  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing literature to social and political changes is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about the future of English civilization is somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion.
