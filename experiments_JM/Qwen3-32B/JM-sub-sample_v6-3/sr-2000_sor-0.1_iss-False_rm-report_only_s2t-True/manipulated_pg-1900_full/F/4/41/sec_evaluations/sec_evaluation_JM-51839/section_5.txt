2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] Some sentences reference events or people without sufficient context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the history of Nacogdoches.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph listing the nine flags is somewhat disjointed and could benefit from clearer organization or explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical narrative to the section on historical sites is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph listing the nine flags is repetitive and could be more clearly structured to avoid confusion.
