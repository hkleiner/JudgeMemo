- [LOGIC] The final section about Skylemore and "Rob Roy" feels disconnected from the rest of the text  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear narrative arc or unifying theme, making it feel like a collection of loosely connected anecdotes  
- [CLARITY] Some references (e.g., "Rob Roy") are unclear without additional context  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the trip and the relationships between characters are not clearly established  
- [TRANSITION] Transitions between locations and topics are abrupt and lack smooth connections  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the story of the dog to the historical Border Clans is jarring and lacks context
