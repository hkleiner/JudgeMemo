2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Robert's personal experience to a general description of the army's movements without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative abruptly shifts from the battle to a reflection on Robert's past and future without clear motivation.  
- [CLARITY] The final lines address the reader directly and shift to a poetic tone, which is jarring and lacks clear connection to the preceding narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the battle to the British sentinels and the final poetic lines is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Molly" as a drummer is introduced without prior context, making it confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The final lines are overly poetic and lack clear narrative purpose, making the ending feel disjointed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
