2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different events and time periods without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some statements are made without sufficient context or explanation, such as the sudden shift to discussing Romania without clear connection to the prior discussion of Russia's role in 1916.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is occasionally unclear, especially in the way it shifts blame and discusses the effectiveness of military strategies without clear cause-and-effect explanations.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the "Salvation of Roumania" chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the preceding content.
