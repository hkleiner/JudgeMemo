2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and complex, with long, nested sentences that may obscure the logical flow for some readers.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are abstract or highly theological, which may make the meaning less accessible to readers unfamiliar with Bahá'í terminology or concepts.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt, especially when shifting between historical, theological, and philosophical arguments.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the "Covenant" and the role of religious figures is logically sound, but the dense phrasing and occasional lack of clear signposting may hinder clarity.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
