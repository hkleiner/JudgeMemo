- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt or unclear, especially between the Seattle principal's report and the chapter on the janitor.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing extra-curricular activities to the janitor's role is not clearly connected, creating a disjointed narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, reducing clarity and making the main points harder to grasp.
