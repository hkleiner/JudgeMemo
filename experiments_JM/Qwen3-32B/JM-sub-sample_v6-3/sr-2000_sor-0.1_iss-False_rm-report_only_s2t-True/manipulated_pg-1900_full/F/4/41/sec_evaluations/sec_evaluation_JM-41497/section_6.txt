2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing Reynolds' treatment of women and children to his portraits of men without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences reference specific paintings or people without sufficient context for a reader unfamiliar with the subject  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "To satisfy the claims of Reynolds' brush it was absolutely necessary that his sitters should have character, even if it was a bad ine" is confusing due to the typo and unclear phrasing  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the fading of Reynolds' paintings feels disconnected from the preceding discussion of his portraits of men
