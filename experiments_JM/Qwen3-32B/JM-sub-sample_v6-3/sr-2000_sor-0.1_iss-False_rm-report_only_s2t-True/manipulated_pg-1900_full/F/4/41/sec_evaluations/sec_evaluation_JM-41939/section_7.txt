- [GRAMMAR] "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing the painting to the artist's death and funeral without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The section moves abruptly from the painting "The Threshing of the Grain" to the artist's old age and death, with little connection between the ideas  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the artist's final painting to her death is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative flow  
- [CLARITY] "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity" is vague and could be clearer  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
