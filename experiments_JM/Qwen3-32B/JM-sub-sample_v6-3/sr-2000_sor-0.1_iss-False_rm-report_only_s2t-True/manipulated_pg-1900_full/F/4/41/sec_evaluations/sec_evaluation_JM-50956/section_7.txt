2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a dense, continuous argument with minimal paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt, especially between paragraphs discussing different years and events.  
- [CLARITY] The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the war and military strategy, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.  
- [LOGIC] Some cause-and-effect relationships are implied but not clearly explained, such as how Russia's actions directly led to the outcomes described.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraphs shift from historical analysis to speculative future implications without clear signposting.
