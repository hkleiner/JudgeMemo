- [GRAMMAR] "The favorable publicity won by the use of these 'old-fasuioned' types on Strathmore papers, convinces me..." (subject-verb agreement)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Moses gave me what I am now sure was much good business advice--but, alas, I was temperamentally unfitted to listen and learn and, knowing nothing about finsnces, was eventually overwhelmed and broke ubder the strain..." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)

- [GRAMMAR] "You are on your way to Scribner’s. A few moments later we find you seated..." (awkward transition and inconsistent tense)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from the growth of the Wayside Press to the interlude in New York without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The section about the Christmas number of Century and the DeVinne Press is disconnected from the main narrative about the Wayside Press.  
- [LOGIC] The interlude in New York is presented in a disjointed, almost theatrical style that contrasts sharply with the earlier narrative, making the transition jarring.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the Christmas number and the DeVinne Press is unclear in its connection to the rest of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next, especially in the transition to the New York interlude.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative becomes confusing when it shifts to a more stylized, almost fictionalized account of the author's visit to Scribner’s and Richard Harding Davis.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the business narrative to the New York interlude is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
