2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in focus between Corvick, Gwendolen, and Vereker without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is dense and at times confusing due to the rapid introduction of multiple characters and their motivations.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or lack sufficient context, such as "the chase for which I myself had sounded the horn."  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between different scenes or reflections, such as the shift from Corvick and Gwendolenâ€™s intellectual pursuit to the chessplayer imagery.  
- [LOGIC] The metaphor of the chess game is introduced suddenly and is not clearly connected to the preceding narrative.
