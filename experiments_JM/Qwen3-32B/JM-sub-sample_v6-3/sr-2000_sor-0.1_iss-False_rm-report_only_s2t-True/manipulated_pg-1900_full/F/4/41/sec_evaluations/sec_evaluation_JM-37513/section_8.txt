2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The concept of "gravitative knowledge" is introduced in a way that blurs the distinction between scientific and metaphorical language, making it difficult to follow the argument.  
- [CLARITY] The use of the term "knowing" in a non-literal sense (e.g., "the earth knows the sun") is ambiguous and lacks clear definition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples (e.g., billiard balls, plants growing toward light) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about awareness and cognition is presented in a circular manner, with unclear distinctions between different types of knowledge.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "cognitive process implies relatedness to what we call, rather loosely, prior experience" is vague and lacks specificity.  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of "self-awareness" in cognition is abstract and lacks a clear logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "cortical process" and "psycho-physical parallelism" is introduced abruptly and is not clearly connected to the broader argument.
