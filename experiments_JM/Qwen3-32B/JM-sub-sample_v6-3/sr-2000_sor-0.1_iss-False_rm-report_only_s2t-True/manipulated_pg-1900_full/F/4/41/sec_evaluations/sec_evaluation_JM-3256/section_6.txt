2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the bookman's self-deception to the idea of giving a book as a birthday present to himself (confusing transition)  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the bookman's self-presentation of a book to a broader reflection on the value of books without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Emerson and the quote feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding narrative about the bookman's life  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of books as friends is introduced but not clearly developed or connected to the earlier narrative about the bookman's vices and virtues  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different narrative modes (first-person narrator, the bookman's perspective, and philosophical reflection) without clear transitions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
