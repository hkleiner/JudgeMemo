2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] The shift from the emotional narrative to the educational system in the Philippines is jarring and lacks a logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the "baile" event is disconnected from the previous narrative, making the overall structure feel disjointed.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the emotional farewell scene and the educational narrative is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from one event (the farewell) to another (the town description) without clear transitions or context.
