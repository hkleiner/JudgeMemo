2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the superintendent's experiences with school boards to the chapter on school activities is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (manual training, athletic associations, literary societies) without clear transitions or unifying themes.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are vague or lack specificity, such as "I could give many illustrations of teachers who have 'found themselves' through being associated with student enterprises."  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the superintendent's personal experiences to general advice about school activities is not clearly signaled.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes introduces new ideas without sufficient context, such as the mention of a "literary society" without explaining its relevance to the broader discussion.
