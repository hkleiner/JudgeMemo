2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Fragonard's artistic development to political intrigue in Paris, with no clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The political events in Paris are detailed at length, but their connection to Fragonard's life and work is unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative jumps between Fragonard's artistic journey and unrelated political developments, making the overall flow disjointed.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on Fragonard's return to Paris to the section on Boucher and the new critics is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The High Priest Coresus" and its critical reception is introduced without sufficient background or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the painting "Les hazards heureux de l'Escarpolette" is introduced with minimal context, making it feel disconnected from the broader narrative.
