- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without clear transitions or connections to the previous content.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally lacks clarity in how ideas are presented, especially in the transition from one administrative concern to another.  
- [TRANSITION] The flow between the sections on professional leadership, administrative practices, and personal relationships is not smooth, making the overall structure feel disjointed.
