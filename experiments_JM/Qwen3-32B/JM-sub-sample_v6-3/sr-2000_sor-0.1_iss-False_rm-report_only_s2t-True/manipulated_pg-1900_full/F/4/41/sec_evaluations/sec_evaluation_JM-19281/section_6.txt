2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple religious traditions and scriptural references without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the central argument.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences introduce ideas that are not clearly connected to the preceding or following content, such as the shift from Bahá'u'lláh to the Bhagavad-Gita.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of phrases like "the one discerns and articulates the values unfolding progressively through Divine revelation" is vague and ambiguous.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of religion to the comparison with science is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link.  
- [LOGIC] The phrase "It is, therefore, an inadequate recognition..." is introduced without sufficient prior explanation or context.
