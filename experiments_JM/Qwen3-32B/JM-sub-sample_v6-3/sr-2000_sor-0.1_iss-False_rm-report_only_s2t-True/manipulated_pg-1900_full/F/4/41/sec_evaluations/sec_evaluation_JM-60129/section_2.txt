- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or unclear, such as "the whole is finished off by a large metal ornament" without clear reference.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the head-dress is detailed but lacks a clear sequence, making it hard to visualize.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from describing the Sarö Yögurs' clothing to their economic conditions is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the author's equipment and craniometer feels disconnected from the rest of the text.
