2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and highly abstract, making it difficult to follow the logical progression for readers unfamiliar with the philosophical context.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and contain nested clauses, reducing clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and empirical references without clear transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin abruptly without clear links to the previous content.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The use of technical terms (e.g., "noumenon," "cognitive relatedness") is consistent, but their meanings are not always clearly explained.
