2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Fragonard's death to broader historical and artistic commentary without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph jumps from Fragonard's death to a generalized reflection on French art and history without clear connection to the preceding narrative  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex and abstract, making the meaning difficult to follow (e.g., "skomking over the dangerous deeps of its mighty significance")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, especially between the narrative of Fragonard's life and the broader historical commentary  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
