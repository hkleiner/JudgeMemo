- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different types of meetings (teachers' meetings, school board meetings) without clear progression or connection.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, making it difficult to follow the main point.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the chapter on teachers' meetings and the chapter on meetings with the school board is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The example of the failed superintendent is introduced and resolved without clear connection to the broader discussion of effective meetings.
