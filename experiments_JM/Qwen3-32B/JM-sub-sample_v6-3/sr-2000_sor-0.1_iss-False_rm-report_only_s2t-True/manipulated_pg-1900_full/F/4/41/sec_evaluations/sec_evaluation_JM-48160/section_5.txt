2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the soldier’s behavior to the narrator’s personal reflections on war without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "taubes" (German aircraft) appears abruptly without prior context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the narrator’s experience to James M. Beck and Owen Johnson is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the narrator’s personal journey to the description of the American officer and driver is disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the Marquise d’Andigné and her absence is introduced without clear relevance to the main narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the automobile trip to the narrator’s self-deprecating reflection on being a "mascot" is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the roads and camions feels disconnected from the earlier narrative about the narrator’s experiences.
