  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from Fragonard's artistic development to political events involving the king and Damiens.
    - [LOGIC]:

        • The transition from Fragonard's time in Rome to his artistic awakening is somewhat abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The phrase "Rome was not his grave" is metaphorical and may be confusing without context.
