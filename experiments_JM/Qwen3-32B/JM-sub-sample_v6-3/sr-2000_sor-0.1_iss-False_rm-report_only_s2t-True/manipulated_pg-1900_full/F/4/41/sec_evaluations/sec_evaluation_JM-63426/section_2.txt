2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the protagonist's personal journey to historical context about the Iron Ore and its legal issues with Theodore Roosevelt, which is not clearly connected to the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the protagonist's work at the print shop to the description of the Peninsula Record and the decision to switch jobs is abrupt and lacks clear motivation.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the Iron Ore job printer" and the protagonist's feelings about him is unclear in context, as the reader is not given enough background on the printer's role.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the protagonist's work at the print shop to the description of the town's vulnerability to "traveling fakers" is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative connection.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden description of the editor shooting a kerosene tank is jarring and not clearly tied to the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "kn ’85 a man’s wages" is unclear and confusing in context.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the protagonist's work at the print shop to the description of the atelier in Chicago is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative bridge.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "you are no master of tint-cutting" is vague and lacks context for the reader.
