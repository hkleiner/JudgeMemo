- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or require excessive inference to understand (e.g., "the best things I had said in it became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there")  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is dense and complex, with multiple layers of dialogue and internal reflection that may confuse the reader  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between scenes (e.g., from dinner to Vereker’s visit to the narrator’s room) without clear signposting
