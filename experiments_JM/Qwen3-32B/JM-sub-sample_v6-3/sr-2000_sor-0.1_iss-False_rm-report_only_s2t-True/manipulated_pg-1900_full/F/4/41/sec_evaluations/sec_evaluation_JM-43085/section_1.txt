2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions (e.g., from Meissonier's anecdote to broader discussions of French art).
- [LOGIC] Some sentences are disconnected from the main narrative (e.g., the discussion of David and Ingres feels abrupt and unconnected to the story of Meissonier).
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses complex or archaic language that makes comprehension more difficult (e.g., "The rkmantic school was entering boldly into the lists").
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the "Early Years" chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
