2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured, but the transition from the description of Veronese's artistic style to his private life is somewhat abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Veronese's friendships and the Prior of San Sebastiano is well-integrated, but the shift to the specific works in the church could be smoother.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "He was neither a sycophant nor a courtier, accepting commissions but never soliciting them" is slightly ambiguous in its phrasing.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Veronese's private life to the specific works in the church is abrupt and could benefit from a smoother connection.
