2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a list of historical sites and figures with minimal transitions between entries, making it feel fragmented.  
- [CLARITY] Some entries are very brief and lack context, making it difficult to understand the significance of the sites or individuals.  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from one site to another without clear connections or a unifying narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section is organized as a list of entries, but the lack of headings or clear separation between entries reduces readability.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are incomplete or lack necessary information, such as the sentence about "General Sam Houston was baptized into thevRoman Catholic church in May, 1833," which lacks a subject for the verb "was baptized."
