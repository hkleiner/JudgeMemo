2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple historical events and locations without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences introduce new ideas abruptly without sufficient context or connection to the previous content.  
- [CLARITY] The dense historical information and multiple references to churches and figures make the narrative difficult to follow at times.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the early Christianization of Canterbury to the later development of churches lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the Danes and Alphege feels disconnected from the preceding detailed architectural and ecclesiastical history.
