2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense, with multiple ideas introduced and developed without clear segmentation, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt, especially when shifting from historical context to philosophical reflection.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is complex and occasionally ambiguous, especially in the final paragraphs where abstract concepts are discussed without sufficient elaboration.  
- [TRANSITION] Some sentences begin with new ideas without clear reference to the previous ones, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
