2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple narrative threads (e.g., Assyrian relations, Alashia, Mitani, Tushratta) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some references (e.g., "Napkhuria," "Tushratta," "Teye") are unclear without prior context, making it difficult to follow the relationships.  
- [CLARITY] The letter from Tushratta to Teye is dense and repetitive, with unclear logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the letter to the analysis of the characters is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces character analysis and speculation without clear connection to the preceding narrative.
