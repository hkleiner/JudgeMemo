2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from describing hospital conditions to personal anecdotes about a woman with a floating kidney, with little transition.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from the woman with thirteen children to the description of the Hôpital Central with minimal connection.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Dr. Blake" and his invention is introduced abruptly without prior context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the woman’s story to the description of the Hôpital Central is abrupt and lacks logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Frenchman married to an American girl is introduced without clear connection to the previous discussion of French noblesse and their financial struggles.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph shifts from describing the Frenchman’s situation to an appeal to readers of the *Times*, with little explanation or transition.
