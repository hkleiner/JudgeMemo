2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense, with multiple ideas introduced in a single sentence, making it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt, especially between the discussion of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings and the description of the Bahá'í community.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of certain phrases is unclear due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as "the planet's heterogeneous populations could set out together on the discovery of their nature as a single human race."  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the concept of unity and the practical implications of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings is not always clearly articulated.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Bahá'í community is long and lacks clear sub-division, making it hard to follow the progression of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces new ideas about the Bahá'í community's unity without clearly linking them to the previous discussion of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings.
