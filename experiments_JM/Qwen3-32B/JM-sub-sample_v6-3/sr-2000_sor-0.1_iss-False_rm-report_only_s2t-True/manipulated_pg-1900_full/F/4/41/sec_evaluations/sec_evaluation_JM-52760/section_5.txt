2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the battle at the crater to a broader strategic overview without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the Union encirclement continues the narrative but lacks a clear connection to the preceding section.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly dense and contain multiple ideas, making it difficult to follow the progression of events.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the battle at the crater to the broader campaign context is abrupt and lacks smooth linkage.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
