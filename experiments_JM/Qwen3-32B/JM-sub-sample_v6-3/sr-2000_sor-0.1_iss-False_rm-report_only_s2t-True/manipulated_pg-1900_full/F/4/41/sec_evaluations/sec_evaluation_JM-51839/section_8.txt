2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a series of historical markers and facts without a clear narrative thread connecting them.
- [LOGIC] The transition from one historical figure or location to another is abrupt and lacks explanation of relationships.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are unclear or lack context, such as "Site marked by the State of Texas" without specifying what site.
- [TRANSITION] The text jumps between different topics (e.g., Masonic Lodge, El Camino Real, Nacogdoches University) without smooth transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The structure is disjointed, with each section appearing as a separate entry rather than a cohesive whole.
