2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is long and dense, with multiple ideas introduced in rapid succession, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, especially when shifting from descriptions of the studio to her travels and then to her reputation.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of her menagerie is repeated in different contexts without clear connection or progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from her studio in the Rue d'Assas to her travels in Scotland is not clearly signaled, causing a minor disconnect.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the French and English appreciation of her work is somewhat disjointed from the preceding and following content.
