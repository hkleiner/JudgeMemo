2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road to the Battle of the Crater without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the Crater is introduced with minimal context, making it difficult to follow the connection to the previous discussion of Union strategies.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "8,000 lbs." at the end of the text is unclear and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Union's general strategy to the specific mining operation is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
