Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "thr" instead of "the"  
- [GRAMMAR] "let what may come of it" – awkward phrasing, should be "let what may come of it" is acceptable but "let what may come of it" is slightly awkward  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Knowing that, let what may come of it" – missing comma after introductory phrase  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The metaphor of thoughts as "children born to him" is somewhat abstract and may be confusing without more context  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Spencer's role in the past to the idea of thoughts as "children" is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear logical connection  
- [CLARITY] "Not as adventitious therefore will thr wise man regard the faith that is in him" – the sentence structure is complex and slightly confusing  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
