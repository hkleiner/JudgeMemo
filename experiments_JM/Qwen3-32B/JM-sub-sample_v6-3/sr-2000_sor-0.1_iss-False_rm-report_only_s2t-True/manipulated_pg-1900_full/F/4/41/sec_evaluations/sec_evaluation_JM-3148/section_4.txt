- [CLARITY] The connection between Anthony’s internal monologue and the introduction of Mrs. Butterfield’s death is unclear  
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the chapter heading and the new section is abrupt and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of Aunt Hitty and her funeral planning feels disconnected from the previous section about Anthony  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are overly complex or ambiguous, making the narrative harder to follow (e.g., “potential genius for ever needs an angel of deliverance to set it free”)
