2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's internal conflict to the wedding ceremony without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The final section about the wedding feels disconnected from the earlier narrative about her decision and emotional conflict  
- [CLARITY] The fragmented ending with "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Pihg becomes a member of the family of Chia" disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the wedding preparations to the final line is abrupt and lacks coherence  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
