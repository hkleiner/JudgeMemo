2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from architectural description to historical anecdotes without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences reference prior context (e.g., "as already stated") that is not visible in the current segment, creating confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The contrast between medieval and modern perspectives is occasionally unclear or abrupt.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between descriptions of different architectural features and historical figures.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the tomb of Edward the Black Prince feels disconnected from the broader narrative flow.
