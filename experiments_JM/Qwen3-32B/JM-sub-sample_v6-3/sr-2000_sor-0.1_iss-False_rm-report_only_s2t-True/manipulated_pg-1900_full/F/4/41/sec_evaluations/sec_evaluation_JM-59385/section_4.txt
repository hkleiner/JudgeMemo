2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's internal thoughts to the birth of the child with minimal transition  
- [LOGIC] The final section about the child's birth and Miss Porter's visit feels disconnected from the earlier narrative about Kuei Ping's struggle within the compound  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time points and events without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The final lines "Wherein a son is born and there is great rejoicing" are abrupt and lack context  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family tribunal to the birth of the child is unclear and jarring  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
