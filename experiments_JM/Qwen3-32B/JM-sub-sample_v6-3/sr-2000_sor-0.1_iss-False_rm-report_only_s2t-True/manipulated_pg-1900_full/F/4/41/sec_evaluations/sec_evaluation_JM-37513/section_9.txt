2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text is dense and abstract, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas without prior context.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraphing is inconsistent, with some ideas abruptly shifting without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The use of complex and technical terminology (e.g., "cognitive relatedness," "physico-chemical basis") may obscure meaning for readers unfamiliar with the subject.  
- [TRANSITION] Some sentences begin with new ideas without sufficient connection to the previous sentence, creating abrupt shifts.  
- [LOGIC] The argument moves between philosophical concepts and scientific hypotheses without always clarifying the relationship between them.  
- [CLARITY] The repeated references to Spencer and his theories are not always clearly explained in relation to the author's own position.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion is somewhat abrupt and lacks a clear summary of the main argument.
