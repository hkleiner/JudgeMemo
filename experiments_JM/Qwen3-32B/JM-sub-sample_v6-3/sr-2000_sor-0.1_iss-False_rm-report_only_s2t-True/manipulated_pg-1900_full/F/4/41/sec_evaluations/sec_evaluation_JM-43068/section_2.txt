2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a long, continuous narrative with few clear paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas.  
- [LOGIC] Some transitions between ideas are abrupt, especially when shifting from one painting to another or from artistic analysis to biographical details.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of certain phrases is unclear due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which hinders comprehension.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Millet's artistic philosophy to his early life is not clearly marked, making the connection between the two sections less smooth.
