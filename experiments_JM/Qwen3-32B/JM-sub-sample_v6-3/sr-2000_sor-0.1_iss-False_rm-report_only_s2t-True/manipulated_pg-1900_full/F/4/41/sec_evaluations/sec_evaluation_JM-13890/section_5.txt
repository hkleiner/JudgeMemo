- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical events and architectural details without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Henry II's penance and the subsequent fire at the cathedral is not clearly explained.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the rebuilding of the cathedral is confusing due to the rapid shift between architects and styles.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the cathedral's construction to the mention of Prior Chillenden's work is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Canterbury's decline and its historical significance is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear narrative thread.
