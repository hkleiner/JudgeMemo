2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the Du Barry's rejection of Fragonard's work to the narrative of Fragonard's marriage with little transitional explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Du Barry's story to the GÃ©rard family in Grasse is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the old culture was gone" is vague and lacks elaboration.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Du Barry's influence on the king to the description of Fragonard's marriage is jarring and lacks smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Fragonard's marriage and its influence on his art is introduced without sufficient context or explanation of how it relates to the previous narrative.
