2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly between different historical events and locations without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts from the history of the Old Stone Fort to unrelated topics like the Missions and Presidio, the Stage Stand, and the Grave of William Goyens, with no clear connection or progression.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, making it difficult to follow the main point.  
- [TRANSITION] There is a lack of transitional phrases or sentences to guide the reader through the different sections.  
- [LOGIC] The final section about the Goyens family cemetery feels disconnected from the rest of the text and is introduced without context.
