2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and complex, with long, nested sentences that make it difficult to follow the logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or unclear, such as "the cardinal error of Spencer is to take experience already allotted as given."  
- [LOGIC] The argument shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples without clear transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Spencer to Bergson is abrupt and lacks a clear connecting thread.  
- [LOGIC] The text occasionally introduces new ideas without sufficient explanation or context, such as "the evolved which is a result" and "evolution itself, which is the act."  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the intellect provides only a world of symbols" is not clearly elaborated.  
- [LOGIC] The distinction between "cause" and "conditions" is introduced but not clearly resolved.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the cardinal error of Spencer" is not clearly defined or explained.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Spencer's transfigured realism" and "M. Bergson's transformed realism" without sufficient elaboration.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the evolved" and "evolution" is not consistently clarified.
