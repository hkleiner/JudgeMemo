- [SPELLING] "fourpence-halfpenny" (archaic term that may be unfamiliar to modern readers)
- [LEXICON] "trifle with literature" (ambiguous phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "he desired to create an atmosphere, and so he proposed with a certain imposing air that we should visit what he called 'my library.'" (long, complex sentence)
- [GRAMMAR] "As he was to preside at a lecture I was delivering he had in his courtesy invited me to dinner" (missing comma)
- [SYNTAX] "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "and his fastidiousness to ignore a friend in a fourpence-halfpenny edition" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "The bookman, like the poet, and a good many other people, is born and not made" (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues:

- [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is complex with multiple nested examples and references
- [CLARITY] Some references to specific books and authors may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the context
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the first anecdote to the colonial squatter story is abrupt
- [LOGIC] The comparison between the colonial squatter and modern readers is somewhat disjointed
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Mystery of a Hansom Cab" and "John Inglesant" may be confusing without context
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between different types of examples (anecdotes, literary references, personal observations) without clear organization
- [LOGIC] The conclusion about bookmen and their reading habits feels somewhat disconnected from the earlier examples
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Mark Rutherford" at the end is abrupt and lacks context
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear paragraph breaks that would help organize the different ideas
