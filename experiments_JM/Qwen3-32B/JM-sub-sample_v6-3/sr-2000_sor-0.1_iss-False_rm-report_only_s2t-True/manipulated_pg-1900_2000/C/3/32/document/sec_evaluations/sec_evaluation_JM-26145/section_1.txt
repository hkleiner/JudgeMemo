- [GRAMMAR] "about 1380 the stuff by Amenophis IV." – missing preposition and unclear reference.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the stuff speech of Babylon served as the language of diplomacy" – unclear use of "the stuff speech."  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Assyrian system of cuneiform may have originated in a stuff." – vague and grammatically incorrect.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors" – awkward phrasing and unclear structure.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the well-filled harem, the cultivation of 'wisdom' (which practically, no doubt, was tantamount to what we should call 'preciosity');" – run-on sentence and awkward phrasing.  
- [SPELLING] "fellahìn" – inconsistent spelling (should be "fellahin" or "fellahin").  
- [SPELLING] "fruited abroad" – incorrect word usage.  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" – repeated use of "a thing" instead of specific terms.  
- [SYNTAX] "The terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors" – awkward and confusing syntax.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of "a thing" and "the thing" without clear context or definition.  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently references "a stuff" and "the stuff" without explanation, making it difficult to follow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different topics (e.g., tablets, kings, scribes) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the tablets and the Egyptian court is not clearly established in the flow of the text.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the tablets and their significance is not consistently explained throughout the text.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the tablets to the discussion of the Egyptian court is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [CLARITY] The use of terms like "House of the Sun" and "Manakhbiria" is not explained, making the text less accessible.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "Pharaoh" but later notes that the term is not used in the documents, which is confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The role of scribes and the nature of the cuneiform script is not consistently explained.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the religious reform of Amenophis IV. and the tablets is not clearly made.
