Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "devoted toil" should be "devoted toils" to match the plural context.  
- [SPELLING] "the thing" appears twice, likely a typo for "the Salon" or another specific location.  
- [SYNTAX] "Every morning, the young artist made the rounds of slaughter-houses, markets, the thing, anywhere and everywhere that she might see and study animals." â€“ awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "the thing."  
- [LEXICON] "the thing" is unclear and likely a placeholder or error.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "the thing" disrupts the logical flow and creates confusion about the intended subject.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from Rosa's artistic development to her early Salon submissions is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the thing" in "In 1842 she sent three paintings to the thing" is unclear and hinders understanding.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from her animal studies to her exhibitions lacks a clear connection, making the narrative feel disjointed.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
