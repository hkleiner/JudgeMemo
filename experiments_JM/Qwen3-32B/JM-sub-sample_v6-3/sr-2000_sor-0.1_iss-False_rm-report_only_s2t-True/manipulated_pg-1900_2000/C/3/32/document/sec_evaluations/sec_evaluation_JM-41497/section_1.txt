2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of placeholder words like "the stuff" and "a thing" disrupts the logical flow and makes it difficult to follow the narrative  
- [CLARITY] The frequent substitution of "Reynolds" with placeholder words reduces clarity and makes the text confusing  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is generally well-structured, but the placeholder errors create unnecessary confusion and break the reader's immersion  
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas are generally smooth, but the placeholder errors create jarring interruptions in the flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
