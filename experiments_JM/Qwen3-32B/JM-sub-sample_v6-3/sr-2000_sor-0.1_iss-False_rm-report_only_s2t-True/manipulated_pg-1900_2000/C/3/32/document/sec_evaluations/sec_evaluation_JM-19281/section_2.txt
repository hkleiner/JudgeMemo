Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the collapse of a stuff an age of international peace had dawned" (context reference, not current section)  
- [SYNTAX] "The thing sectarian conflicts, apparently unresponsive to the patient arts of diplomacy, have re-emerged..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the collapse of a stuff an age" (likely a typo or missing word)  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling, not incorrect but may be inconsistent with American English if that is the intended style)  
- [SYNTAX] "The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum." (somewhat awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The thing sectarian conflicts..." (awkward phrasing that disrupts logical flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing the revival of spiritual search to discussing the migration of believers to sects (lack of smooth transition)  
- [CLARITY] "The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum." (vague reference to "the phenomenon" without clear antecedent)  
- [TRANSITION] Jump from discussing New Age movements to the Bahá'í perspective without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development has left no doubt." (unclear what the "no doubt" refers to)
