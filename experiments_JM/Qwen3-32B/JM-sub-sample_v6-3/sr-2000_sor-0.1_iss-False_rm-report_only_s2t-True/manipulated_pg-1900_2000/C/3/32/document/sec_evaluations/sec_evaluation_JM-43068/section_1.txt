- [GRAMMAR] "He further saw that work, although they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life liveable to them" (awkward phrasing and unclear pronoun reference)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "the birth of a thing" and repeated use of "the thing" throughout the text (confusing and illogical references)  
- [LOGIC] "the wonderful series of pictures in a thing" (lacks logical connection to the subject)  
- [LOGIC] "under the thing painter's influence" (unclear reference to a painter, disrupting logical flow)  
- [LOGIC] "He further saw that work, although they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life liveable to them" (confusing logic and unclear connection to the subject)  
- [LOGIC] "He shared their struggles in their most intense and poignant form" (vague and lacks clear connection to the narrative)  
- [LOGIC] "It must be remembered that modern life, particularly as lived in great cities such as the thing or Paris" (confusing reference to "the thing")  
- [LOGIC] "He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has heard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of every grade of society are so familiar" (confusing and disjointed from the main argument)  
- [LOGIC] "The only softening influence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing this moment of the angelus for depicting them" (confusing and lacks clear logical progression)  
- [LOGIC] "Brilliancy of technique and extraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey some message, will inevitably find its own level" (confusing and lacks clear logical connection to the main argument)  
- [LOGIC] "It may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet will never occupy a very high position in the world of art" (sudden shift in tone and argument without clear transition)
