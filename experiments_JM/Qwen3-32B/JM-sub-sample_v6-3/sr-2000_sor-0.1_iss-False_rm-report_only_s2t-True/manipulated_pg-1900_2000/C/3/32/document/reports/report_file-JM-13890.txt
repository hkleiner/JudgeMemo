        • "the city of the men of Kent" (awkward phrasing)

  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Repeated use of "the stuff" and "the thing" without clear meaning disrupts logical flow
        • Sudden shift from historical narrative to speculative future about the Church in the last paragraph
        • The final paragraph about the future of the Church is disconnected from the main historical narrative
        • The reference to "a stuff Martin's" is confusing and lacks context
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "It took the thing nearly nine centuries to make up its mind..." is unclear and confusing
        • "the zeal and enthusiasm of the band of missionaries began to bring in many converts" is vague and lacks clarity
        • "the organization of the churches holding to the Elizabethan form of worship will no doubt continue to be centred and focussed at Canterbury" is awkward and unclear
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between historical events and speculative or ambiguous statements without clear transitions
