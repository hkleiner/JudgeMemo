Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" appears multiple times, likely a placeholder or error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "In whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures" is awkward and passive.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." has a run-on structure.  
- [SPELLING] "the stuff" appears multiple times, likely a placeholder or error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The ecclesiastical language of the orthodox Slavs, is only just intelligible..." has incorrect punctuation.  
- [SPELLING] "the services of the Buddhists in the stuff are either in Sanscrit or in ancient Chinese" has unclear and likely incorrect phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "We may join in hoping that again in a thing Hebrew may recover..." has a placeholder or error.  
- [GRAMMAR] "In any Roman Catholic church in a thing to-day..." has a placeholder or error.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "a thing" and "the stuff" disrupts the logical flow and makes the text confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The text references historical and religious examples without sufficient context, making it difficult to follow for a general reader.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the biography of Arthur Davis to the broader discussion of ritual languages is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Hebrew and other ritual languages is occasionally unclear and lacks a consistent argumentative thread.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the roses of Jericho" is metaphorical but not clearly explained in the context of the argument.  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of Germanism and its relation to the idea of a "Chosen People" is introduced suddenly and lacks a smooth transition.
