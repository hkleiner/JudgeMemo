        • "the courtesy of 'the miserable place to the pleasure of their honorable guests'" (awkward phrasing)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it" (awkward sentence structure)
        • "Now and then someone came from beneath one of the heavy curtain-like doors that closed a shop, and slipped along the silent street" (awkward phrasing)

        • "The girl, holding the jewels thus in her hand that she might feel their nearness..." (awkward phrasing)

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift to "It was graduation day" at the end without clear connection to the previous narrative
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The transition from the jewelry shop scene to the memory of the mission school is abrupt and lacks clear connection
        • The connection between Kuei Ping's experience at the jewelry shop and her memory of the mission school is not clearly established
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The narrative jumps between different time periods (present at the shop and past at the school) without clear transitional markers
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The purpose of the mission school memory is unclear in relation to the main narrative about the Street of Precious Pearls
