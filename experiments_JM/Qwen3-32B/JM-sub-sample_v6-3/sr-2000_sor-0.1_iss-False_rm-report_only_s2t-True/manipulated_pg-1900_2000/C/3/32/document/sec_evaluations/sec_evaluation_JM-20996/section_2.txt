Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling added no little to the discomfort of the situation" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "leggins" (incorrect spelling, should be "leggings")  
- [SYNTAX] "There were Japanese, and East India merchants from the stuff and Calcutta" (confusing phrasing, "from the stuff" is unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "Calcutta" before "and, finally"  
- [LEXICON] "the current of Manila's life when flowing at its height" (vague and awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator's personal experience (wet clothing) to a historical account of Manila without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the bridge and the people is well-structured, but the transition to the notice at the end is abrupt and lacks context  
- [CLARITY] "from the stuff and Calcutta" is unclear and disrupts the logical flow of the sentence  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the notice posted in the quarters is disconnected from the previous description of Manila's daily life  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
