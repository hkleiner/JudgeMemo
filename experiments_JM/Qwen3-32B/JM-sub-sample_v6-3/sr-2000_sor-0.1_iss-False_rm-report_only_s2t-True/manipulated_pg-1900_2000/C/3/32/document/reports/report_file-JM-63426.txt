    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window" is awkwardly structured.
        • "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and 'borrow' packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler" is overly long and confusing.
    - [SPELLING]:

        • "stuff" is used repeatedly without clear meaning.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "devil" is used in a non-standard or archaic way without explanation.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing punctuation in "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The transition from the narrator working at the print shop to the description of a soap-selling "faker" is abrupt and lacks context.
        • The description of the "faker" and the market wagon seems disconnected from the main narrative about the narrator's early career.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The timeline and progression of the narrator's work experience is somewhat disjointed and lacks clear transitions.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The term "devil" is used without explanation, which may confuse modern readers.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the narrator's work history to the description of the "faker" is jarring and lacks a logical connection.
