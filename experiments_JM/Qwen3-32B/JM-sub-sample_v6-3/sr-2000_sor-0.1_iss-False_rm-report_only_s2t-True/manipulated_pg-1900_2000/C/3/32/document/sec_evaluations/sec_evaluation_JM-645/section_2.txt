Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "it")  
- [SYNTAX] "He showed how much he was when before us all Lady Jane wanted to read something aloud." (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." (repetition of "it" and unclear antecedent)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "You _haven’t_ seen it? Then you must." (missing comma after question mark)  
- [SYNTAX] "He did this half an hour later—I saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room." (awkward transition and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." (unclear connection between actions)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from Lady Jane's enthusiasm to Vereker's reaction without clear transition.  
- [CLARITY] "He showed how much he was when before us all Lady Jane wanted to read something aloud." (confusing phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dinner scene to the dialogue between Vereker and Miss Poyle is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] "If the author was 'only me' the thing didn’t seem quite so remarkable." (confusing logic and unclear reference to "the thing")
