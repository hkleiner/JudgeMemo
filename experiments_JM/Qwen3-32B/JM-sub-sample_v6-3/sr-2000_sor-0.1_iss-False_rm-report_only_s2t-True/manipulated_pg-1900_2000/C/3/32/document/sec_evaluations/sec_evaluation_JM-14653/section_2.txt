Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "They were written by devotees. And this age could not have produced them."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex diction ("slaking their ardour for truth", "fearsomely", "ebullition") that may hinder readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in long sentences, e.g., "It was as if people had said: 'We don't know what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and then we shall feel safer.'"  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the warning of its greatest philosophers..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and focus from historical critique to philosophical reflection without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is complex and layered, making it difficult to follow the logical progression at times.  
- [CLARITY] Some abstract concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation, e.g., "the situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to itself and to the Unknown."  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs, especially between the critique of skepticism and the conclusion about Christmas.
