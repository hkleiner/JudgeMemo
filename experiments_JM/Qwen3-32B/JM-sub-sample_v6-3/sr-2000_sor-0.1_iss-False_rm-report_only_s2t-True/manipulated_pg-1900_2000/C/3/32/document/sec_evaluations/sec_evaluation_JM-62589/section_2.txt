Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A sullen look passed over a stuff’s face." (inconsistent use of "a stuff" as a character name)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A thing had suffered so much..." (inconsistent use of "a thing" as a character name)  
- [GRAMMAR] "There was a dangerous flash in a thing’s eyes." (repeated inconsistency in character name)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She gathered herself up and turned a set, white face to her mistress." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "During the day," she added, “think of thy mother..." (missing comma after "During the day")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Rumors of a battle at Lexington where the farmers had dared face the King’s men." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It had never occurred to Debby before, but perhaps her father was among those brave men." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Or, perhaps, he had been at the later battle of the stuff..." (unclear reference to "the stuff")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Debby hated the King for no better reason than because Mrs. Lane worshipped him." (redundant use of "because")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent use of "a stuff" and "a thing" as character names, which creates confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the later battle of the stuff" is unclear and confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Debby’s internal thoughts to the external description of the town and evening prayers is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between Debby’s internal monologue and external events without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the battle of the stuff" lacks context and is not explained.
