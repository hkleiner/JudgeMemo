Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "We had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared" (awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "He regarded us curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then set off down the street at a good pace" (run-on sentence) - [LEXICON] "We ploughed on" (uncommon phrasing that may confuse readers) - [PUNCTUATION] "We had overrun our quarry. He had just emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main street, looking fearfully over his shoulder." (missing comma after "hiding place")
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden transition from the chase to the question about the Dogs' Home feels abrupt - [STRUCTURE] The ending with the man disappearing into a villa feels disconnected from the narrative about finding a dog - [CLARITY] The reference to "Moltke" and "Sedan" may be obscure to modern readers without context - [TRANSITION] The shift to the golf course and the final conversation feels disconnected from the previous chase narrative
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
