Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he consorted with many other men who made some mark in the world of thought" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the thing" (likely a typo or placeholder)  
- [SYNTAX] "he was brought into contact--witness the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought when he established himself in the thing" (confusing and incomplete reference)  
- [LEXICON] "the man in the street" (redundant phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene" (awkward and unclear structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Reynolds' personal life to a general commentary on artists and their intellectual limitations  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Reynolds' human weaknesses is loosely connected to the preceding discussion of his friendships  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Reynolds' personal flaws to a comparison with modern figures ("There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,'...")  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the thing" is unclear and disrupts the flow  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new idea about the atmosphere of Leicester Square without clear connection to the previous discussion
