Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "We however who have witnessed..." (awkward phrasing and missing comma)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" (non-standard spelling; should be "wagons-loads")  
- [SYNTAX] "a most mischievous bit of legislation, like the similar expedients of the last three years" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the famous system of doles out of the rates, in augmentation of wages" (confusing and archaic phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "We however who have witnessed..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the war's impact on intellectual life to the condition of the working class without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on over-population and the role of economists is loosely connected to the previous discussion about the war and its aftermath  
- [CLARITY] "the new wheat fields of the stuff and the sheep walks of Australia" (unclear reference to "the stuff")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing the famine in Ireland to the broader topic of family size and social ambition  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph on progress and Macaulay lacks a clear connection to the earlier discussion of war and social conditions
