- [LEXICON] "The latter had been a trifle curt" (vague reference to "the latter")  
- [SPELLING] "a part of the whole which made up the unit of her family" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other" (typo: "a thing and West" should be "East and West")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The latter had been a trifle curt" (unclear reference to "the latter")  
- [CLARITY] "The utter futility of attempting to make a thing and West understand each other" (confusing phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "The engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life" (sudden shift in focus)
