- [GRAMMAR] "the stuff" (repeated multiple times, likely a placeholder or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing" (repeated multiple times, likely a placeholder or error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the thing nearly nine centuries to make up its mind" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Bishop of the stuff" (likely a placeholder or error)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SPELLING] "a stuff Martin's" (likely a placeholder or error)  
- [SYNTAX] "It took the thing nearly nine centuries to make up its mind..." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the zeal and enthusiasm of the band of missionaries began to bring in many converts" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Repeated use of "the stuff" and "the thing" without clear meaning disrupts logical flow  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from historical narrative to speculative future about the Church in the last paragraph  
- [CLARITY] "It took the thing nearly nine centuries to make up its mind..." is unclear and confusing  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical events and speculative or ambiguous statements without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] "the zeal and enthusiasm of the band of missionaries began to bring in many converts" is vague and lacks clarity  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the future of the Church is disconnected from the main historical narrative  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "a stuff Martin's" is confusing and lacks context  
- [CLARITY] "the organization of the churches holding to the Elizabethan form of worship will no doubt continue to be centred and focussed at Canterbury" is awkward and unclear
