Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The thing shalt suck the milk of nations" (awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "the thing")  
- [SPELLING] "a thing" (repeated and unclear, likely a placeholder or error)  
- [SYNTAX] "It would be indeed strange if a thing, which Napoleon wittily described as 'hatched from a cannon-ball,' should be found really resembling Jud√¶a..." (cumbersome and confusing sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "a thing" (repeated multiple times without clear meaning, likely a placeholder or error)  
- [SYNTAX] "And it is by this canon that we must interpret the concept of a Chosen People, and so much else in our Scriptures." (awkward phrasing and unclear connection)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "a thing" is used repeatedly without clear definition, disrupting logical flow and comprehension  
- [CLARITY] The text references historical and religious figures and events without sufficient context, making it difficult to follow for a general reader  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing biblical passages to modern examples (e.g., Vehaeren, Maeterlinck, an Englishwoman) is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing religious texts to modern political sentiments is jarring and lacks smooth transition  
- [LOGIC] The argument about interpreting the Bible by "Life alone" is introduced without sufficient explanation or connection to the preceding content  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
