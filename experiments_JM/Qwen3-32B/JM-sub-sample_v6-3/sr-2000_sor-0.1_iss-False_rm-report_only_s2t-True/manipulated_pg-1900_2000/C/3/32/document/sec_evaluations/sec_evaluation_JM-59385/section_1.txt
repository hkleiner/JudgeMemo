1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "Turning off from the Da Mou Lui or the stuff, the name common to the main street..." (awkward phrasing with unclear reference to "the stuff")
- [SYNTAX] "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it" (awkward sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "Lend light, lend light" (repetition may be intentional but is stylistically odd)
- [LEXICON] "swaying tapestried box-like chairs" (awkward word choice and phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "Now and then someone came from beneath one of the heavy curtain-like doors that closed a shop, and slipped along the silent street" (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "Kuei Ping caught herself thinking, and then flushed at what she thought her irreverence" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "The head of the shop and his partners flicked their long-stemmed pipes from sleepy lips and rose, as though from deep meditation..." (awkward phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "the courtesy of 'the miserable place to the pleasure of their honorable guests'" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "Wong Lui had placed his best before them" (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "The girl, holding the jewels thus in her hand that she might feel their nearness..." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift to "It was graduation day" at the end without clear connection to the previous narrative
- [LOGIC] The transition from the jewelry shop scene to the memory of the mission school is abrupt and lacks clear connection
- [TRANSITION] The narrative jumps between different time periods (present at the shop and past at the school) without clear transitional markers
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the mission school memory is unclear in relation to the main narrative about the Street of Precious Pearls
- [LOGIC] The connection between Kuei Ping's experience at the jewelry shop and her memory of the mission school is not clearly established

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
