Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The claim had evoked violent hostility from the Muslim clergy, who taught that the process of Divine Revelation had ended with Muá¸¥ammad; and that any assertion to the contrary represented apostasy, punishable by death." (awkward semicolon usage and complex structure disrupts flow)  
- [SYNTAX] "The two jobbers are kicked." (unclear meaning and grammatically odd)  
- [LEXICON] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [SPELLING] "washing-up a Gordon press" (unusual phrasing, possibly missing preposition or article)  
- [SYNTAX] "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and 'borrow' packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler." (run-on sentence with unclear structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the child's school experiences to a detailed historical claim about the Muslim clergy and Divine Revelation (contextually confusing and unrelated)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the child's life and unrelated historical or journalistic details without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] "The two jobbers are kicked." (unclear reference and meaning disrupts narrative flow)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the child's work at the print shop to the description of a soap-selling "faker" is abrupt and lacks contextual connection  
- [LOGIC] The mention of a "kerosene flare" and "guns and fishing rods" in the final paragraph introduces elements that are not clearly connected to the main narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
