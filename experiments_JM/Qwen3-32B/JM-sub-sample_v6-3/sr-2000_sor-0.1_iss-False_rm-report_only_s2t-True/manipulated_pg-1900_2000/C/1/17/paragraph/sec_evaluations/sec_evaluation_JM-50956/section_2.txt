Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "122 millions of Teutons" (should be "122 million")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the former caused a panic which now seems to us exaggerated" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps..." (awkward punctuation and phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "etc., etc." (redundant and informal)  
- [SPELLING] "sanguine World struggle" (awkward phrasing; "sanguine" is likely incorrect in this context)  
- [SYNTAX] "The most modest democratic reforms were therefore impossible till Napoleon was out of the way..." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is difficult to understand how a serious-minded military leader can stoop to employ, in a supposedly serious work, methods fit for the yellow press..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the role of Russia in WWI to discussing Reynolds and Italian artists (disconnected ideas)  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Reynolds and Italian artists is unrelated to the rest of the text and appears to be an abrupt and irrelevant addition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical periods and topics without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the former caused a panic which now seems to us exaggerated" is unclear without context  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing the war to the French Revolution and then to Reynolds is abrupt and lacks logical connection  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
