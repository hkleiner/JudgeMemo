Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers, notably by Carlo Ridolfi." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Veronese's parish church, of the register of deaths wherein the decease of the great painter is entered as having occurred the 19th of April, 1588..." (awkward and overly complex phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The future genial painter of wondrous fantasy yielded himself without a murmur to the rude but salutary exigencies of technique." (cumbersome and archaic phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "Strange caprice on the part of an artist who was destined to show so much dexterity in execution and lavishness in decoration, his tastes turned towards the most severe and least imaginative of masters..." (awkward and overly wordy)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." (incorrect punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to a discussion of George III and political corruption, which is unrelated to Veronese and disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Reynolds and Goldsmith is entirely disconnected from the subject of Veronese and appears to be an extraneous addition.  
- [CLARITY] The transition from Veronese's early life in Verona to the unrelated historical and biographical digressions is abrupt and confusing.  
- [TRANSITION] The text abruptly shifts from Veronese's artistic development to a discussion of 18th-century England and then back to Veronese, creating a disjointed reading experience.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
