(awkward phrasing and punctuation)
- [GRAMMAR] "But the days passed, and no spirit having stirred the venerated bones of the wonder-working saint" (awkward phrasing and missing verb)
- [GRAMMAR] "The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift, that he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what he wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of stating what he desired to state" (awkward phrasing and complex sentence structure)
- [GRAMMAR] "was therefore enabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have taken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry" (awkward phrasing and complex sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "PalÃ¦olithic" (inconsistent spelling with accent mark)
- [SPELLING] "CÃ¦sar" (inconsistent spelling with accent mark)
- [GRAMMAR] "The occasion has encouraged publication of this brief introduction to Bahá’u’lláh’s life and work" (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical periods and topics (Thomas Becket, Boucher, Reynolds, Canterbury history) without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Thomas Becket to discussing Boucher and then to Reynolds, with no clear connection between these topics
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh appears disconnected from the rest of the text with no explanation of its relevance
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between the different sections and topics discussed in the text
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes discusses complex historical and artistic concepts without sufficient explanation for general readers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
