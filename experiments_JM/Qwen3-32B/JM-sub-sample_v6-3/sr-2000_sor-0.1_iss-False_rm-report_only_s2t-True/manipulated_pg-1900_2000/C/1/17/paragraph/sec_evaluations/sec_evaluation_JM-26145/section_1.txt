2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing the Tell el Amarna tablets to discussing Bahá’u’lláh’s writings, with no clear connection or transition.

- [CLARITY] The text introduces Reynolds and his contributions without explaining how this relates to the broader context of the Tell el Amarna tablets or Egyptian history.  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing the Egyptian court and administration to Reynolds and then back to the tablets, creating a disjointed narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next, especially between the sections on the tablets, Bahá’u’lláh, and Reynolds.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Reynolds and the Royal Academy is out of place and does not contribute to the overall narrative about the Tell el Amarna tablets.  
- [CLARITY] The text introduces Reynolds and his contributions without sufficient context or explanation of his relevance to the topic.  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing the religious reform of Amenophis IV to Reynolds and the Royal Academy, with no clear connection.
