Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)  
- [SYNTAX] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (sudden, out-of-place instruction)  
- [LEXICON] "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (irrelevant to the narrative and disrupts flow)  
- [SPELLING] "tapestried" (uncommon and possibly misspelled; should be "tapestried" or "covered in tapestries")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." (awkward placement of commas)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (completely out of context and disrupts narrative flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] "No uncertainty surrounds the nature of the generating impulse." (abrupt and disconnected from the preceding narrative)  
- [TRANSITION] "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." (sudden and irrelevant reference to Leicester Square, with no clear connection to the story)  
- [CLARITY] "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." (unclear and confusing statement with no clear relevance to the narrative)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
