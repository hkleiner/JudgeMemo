        • "a sort of low-necked body" (unclear phrasing, likely should be "garment" or "dress")

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from describing Filipino clothing to discussing Reynolds' art with no clear transition
        • Another abrupt shift from art discussion to the founding of Manila
        • Another abrupt shift from Manila's history to the narrator's experience on the bridge
        • Another shift back to art history with Boucher and Lemoyne
        • Final shift to the group's stay in Manila with no clear connection to previous content
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The text jumps between different topics (Filipino clothing, art history, Manila's history, the narrator's experience) without clear connections
        • The art history segments seem disconnected from the rest of the text about Manila
        • The final paragraph about the teachers' notice appears incomplete and disconnected from the rest of the text
