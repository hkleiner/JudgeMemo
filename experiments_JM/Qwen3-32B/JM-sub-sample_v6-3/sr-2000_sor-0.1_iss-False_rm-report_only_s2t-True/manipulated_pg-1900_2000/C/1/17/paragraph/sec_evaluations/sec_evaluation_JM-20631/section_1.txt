Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures" (passive voice and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "recondite" (correct spelling, but may be considered obscure or difficult for some readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "He would receive no payment for any of his religious work or writings." (simple but repetitive phrasing in context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Use of em dashes without consistent style or clarity in some sentences  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Hebrew to a scene involving "the infant François" and "genial banter" without clear connection to the main topic  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from a eulogy of Arthur Davis to a broader discussion of ritual languages and then to a seemingly unrelated anecdote about "the infant François"  
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about "the infant François" is confusing and appears to be a non-sequitur in the context of the rest of the text  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the discussion of Hebrew and ritual languages to the anecdote about "the infant François"  
- [LOGIC] The final chapter begins with a strong thesis about the "Chosen People" but lacks a clear connection to the preceding chapter  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
