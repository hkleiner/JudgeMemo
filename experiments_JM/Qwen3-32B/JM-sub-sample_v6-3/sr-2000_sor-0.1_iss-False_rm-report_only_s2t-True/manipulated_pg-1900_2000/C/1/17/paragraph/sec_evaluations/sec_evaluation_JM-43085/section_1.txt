Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "One day--it was neither in war time nor during manoeuvres--on a July morning" (awkward punctuation and phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "manoeuvres" (British spelling used in what appears to be an American English text)
- [SYNTAX] "In the streets of Teheran, Western observers were appalled by scenes of Bábí victims blown from cannon mouths, hacked to death by axes and swords, and led to their deaths with burning candles inserted into open wounds in their bodies" (long, complex sentence with multiple actions that is difficult to follow)
- [LEXICON] "The whole artist, whose work we are about to study side by side with his life, is summed up in this anecdote" (awkward phrasing)
- [PUNCTUATION] "Roman characters, Roman costumes, Roman virtues,--such was the ideal" (inconsistent punctuation with em dash)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a story about Meissonier observing a cavalry exercise to a completely different scene in Teheran with Bábí victims
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narrative styles - first a narrative about Meissonier, then a more analytical section about his artistic philosophy, then back to a biographical narrative
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the anecdote about Meissonier and the section about Bahá’u’lláh's experience in Teheran
- [CLARITY] The connection between the Teheran scene and Meissonier's artistic philosophy is not clearly explained
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing Meissonier's early life to making comparisons with Delacroix and Ingres without clear transitions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
