Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Let us spend five minutes in picturing to ourselves the English nation in a condition of stable equilibrium, as it was in the eighteenth century." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá’u’lláh" (not an error, but the presence of non-standard characters may be distracting depending on formatting)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "as if it had been in a bottle strongly corked" (uncommon metaphor that may confuse readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the list of battles and engagements (e.g., "WILDERNESS    MAY 5-7, 1864" lacks proper formatting or punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to discussing Bahá’u’lláh and his vision in the middle of a military history text (disconnected from the main topic)  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on Bahá’u’lláh is out of place and disrupts the logical flow of the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the prologue to the "UNION STRATEGY 1864" chapter without clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "upper arm of the movement" is vague and unclear in context  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "Sherman" at the end of the "UNION STRATEGY 1864" section is confusing without prior introduction  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
