Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "whether he were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short or not" (awkward and incorrect use of subjunctive and semicolon)  
- [SYNTAX] "he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like the three years' conventional Italian study..." (awkward phrasing and unclear syntax)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation in complex sentences  
- [LEXICON] "pictures which, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or hang in galleries under other names" (awkward and overly wordy phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the author of such a book is one 'who has enriched the human mind...'" (cumbersome and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and em dashes in the literary passage  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Boucher's artistic development to a general discussion of classic literature and books (no clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the discussion of classic literature to the French Revolution and its impact (lack of logical progression)  
- [TRANSITION] No clear transition between the literary analysis and the historical discussion of the French Revolution  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor-heavy passage about books as "Cathedrals" and "merchantmen" is abstract and lacks clear connection to the preceding or following content  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about the guards and prisoners appears disconnected from the preceding discussion of literature and history  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
