1) Fluency Issues:

- [SPELLING] "mis-handling" (hyphenation inconsistency)  
- [SYNTAX] "The father, a financial fellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute..." (awkward structure and unclear phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "scurrilous street songs" (ambiguous reference without context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The pleasures of the table may have claimed him when he reached middle age..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "free liver" (colloquial and unclear phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was always perfect master of his self-control..." (missing article "a")  
- [GRAMMAR] "To shut off permanently the supplies that streamed along the railroads..." (awkward word order)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the Battle of Petersburg to a narrative about a girl-child in Paris (no clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition from military history to a biographical narrative about Reynolds and Boucher  
- [CLARITY] "The father, a financial fellow, one Poisson..." (unclear reference to Poisson and his relevance)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt return to the Battle of Petersburg after the unrelated narrative about Reynolds and the girl-child  
- [LOGIC] "Jeanne Antoinette Poisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs..." (unclear reference to "Jane" and its relevance)  
- [STRUCTURE] The section about Reynolds and Boucher interrupts the flow of the military narrative without clear purpose
