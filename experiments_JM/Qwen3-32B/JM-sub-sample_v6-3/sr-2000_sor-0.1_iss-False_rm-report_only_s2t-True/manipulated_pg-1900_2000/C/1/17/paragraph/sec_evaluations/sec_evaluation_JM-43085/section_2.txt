Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Be one's tastes never so modest, it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet..." (awkward phrasing and inversion)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had the virtue of recognising his mediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of mediocre artistry..." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt..." (redundant phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." (missing comma after introductory phrase)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from discussing Reynolds to Nicolas Boucher and then to Meissonier, with little transitional clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different artists and historical contexts without clear signposting or logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the French Revolution and the development of art is vague and lacks a clear causal link.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Meissonier's early struggles to his first exhibition is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
