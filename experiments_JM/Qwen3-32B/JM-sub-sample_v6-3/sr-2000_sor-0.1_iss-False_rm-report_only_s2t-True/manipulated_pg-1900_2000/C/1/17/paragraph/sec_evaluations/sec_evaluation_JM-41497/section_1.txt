Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he was born under a fortunate star, and Nature gave him as a birthday present a rare mixture of talent, industry, and common-sense, together with a sober judgment that could not be turned aside by passion or emotion" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (archaic spelling, not an error but may be distracting for modern readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "Thus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling, for he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous disposition." (awkward structure and redundancy)  
- [LEXICON] "He was always perfect master of his self-control" (missing article "a")  
- [SYNTAX] "A musican knows that the laws of harmony and counterpoint are not fixed..." (misspelling of "musician")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The dream passage is introduced abruptly and lacks clear connection to the surrounding discussion of Reynolds' life and art.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between Reynolds' biography, artistic influences, and broader historical context without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the river of civilisation reaching a stretch of rapids" is metaphorical but lacks sufficient explanation for clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Reynolds' personal life to the broader historical changes in the 18th century is abrupt and lacks logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence "Many artists remain painters all their lives" is disconnected from the preceding content and feels like an incomplete thought.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
