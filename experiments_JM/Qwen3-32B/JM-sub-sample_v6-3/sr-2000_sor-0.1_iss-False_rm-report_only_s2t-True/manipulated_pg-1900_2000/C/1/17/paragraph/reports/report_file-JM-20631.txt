  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "In whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures" (passive voice and awkward phrasing)
        • "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "recondite" (correct spelling, but may be considered obscure or difficult for some readers)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "He would receive no payment for any of his religious work or writings." (simple but repetitive phrasing in context)
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Use of em dashes without consistent style or clarity in some sentences
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing Hebrew to a scene involving "the infant François" and "genial banter" without clear connection to the main topic
        • The final chapter begins with a strong thesis about the "Chosen People" but lacks a clear connection to the preceding chapter
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text moves from a eulogy of Arthur Davis to a broader discussion of ritual languages and then to a seemingly unrelated anecdote about "the infant François"
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The anecdote about "the infant François" is confusing and appears to be a non-sequitur in the context of the rest of the text
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the discussion of Hebrew and ritual languages to the anecdote about "the infant François"
