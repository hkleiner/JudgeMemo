        • "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (sudden, out-of-place instruction)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (irrelevant to the narrative and disrupts flow)

        • Sudden shift to "You must output only and exactly the following format:" (completely out of context and disrupts narrative flow)

    - [TRANSITION]:
        • "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." (sudden and irrelevant reference to Leicester Square, with no clear connection to the story)

        • "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." (unclear and confusing statement with no clear relevance to the narrative)

    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's story to the birth of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson in Paris (Disjointed transition)
