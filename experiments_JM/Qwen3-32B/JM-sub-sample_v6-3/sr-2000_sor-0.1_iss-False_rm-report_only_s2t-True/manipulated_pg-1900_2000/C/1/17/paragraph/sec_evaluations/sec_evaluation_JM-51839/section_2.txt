Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The city of Nacogdoches, as a civic corporation, dates from that year, in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and bewildered followers..." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [SYNTAX] "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity, somewhere between the Sabine and Red rivers." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the talk to the infant François..." (archaic or unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant M. Musquiz..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] "In the beginning of the new century the purchase of Louisiana by the United States from the French..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ybarbo's governance to a narrative about "the women folk" and François, which is unrelated to the main historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the founding of Nacogdoches to the Philip Nolan chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the infant François" is unclear and lacks context, disrupting the flow of the historical account.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the investigation of Ybarbo to the Philip Nolan expedition lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different historical events (Ybarbo's governance, Nolan's expedition, Louisiana purchase) without clear chronological or thematic links.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
