- [SPELLING] "sauv conduit" (misspelled as "sauv" instead of "sauf")  
- [SYNTAX] "If you bring even one letter to society, either in France or any European capital, all doors are open to you..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe, and long since came to the conclusion that all American embassies feel they are created for is to look solemn and important and give receptions." (awkward and grammatically incorrect structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Down to the year of the Italian journey the young painter's life had been quite uneventful." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was in these circumstances, and faced with the prospect of His own imminent death, that Bahá’u’lláh received the first intimation of His mission:" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "You must see something besides Meaux (I flatly refused to go to Rouen), and if I would make out a list of other names they would do their best to get me the necessary permission." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize..." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "There are also three or four cemeteries, one new, and filled only with the identified dead—officers, of course; and older graveyards half filled before the war." (awkward phrasing and structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the author's attempts to enter the war zone to a detailed biography of a 18th-century painter (Reynolds) with no clear connection to the main narrative  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to a description of Boucher and his painting with no clear connection to the main narrative  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to a description of the Bábí victims in Teheran with no clear connection to the main narrative about France in 1916  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics (the author's attempts to enter the war zone, historical figures, and unrelated war atrocities) without clear transitions or explanations  
- [CLARITY] The text references "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" and other organizations without sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with the subject  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about the author's attempts to enter the war zone is interrupted by unrelated historical and biographical information  
- [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between the author's personal narrative and the inserted historical/biographical information
