1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It had not always been such a sad life as Debby had last known with her father." (awkward phrasing)

- [SYNTAX] "I will tell thee of my home. Perhaps we’ll write a letter, they may like to see thee, little lass." (confusing structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Save him, dear, he was a fine man once." (ambiguous phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The untold story was never finished or asked for." (awkward and unclear)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Bahá’u’lláh’s writings forbid the aggressive proselytism through which many religious messages have been widely promulgated." (complex and awkward sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the priority which the Bahá’í community gave to the establishment of groups at the local level throughout the entire planet militated against the early emergence of large concentrations of adherents in any one country or the mobilization of resources required for large-scale programs of public information." (long and complex sentence with poor flow)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She gathered herself up and turned a set, white face to her mistress." (awkward phrasing)

- [CLARITY] The connection between the historical and philosophical content and Debby's personal story is unclear.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the historical section to the new chapter is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps from Debby's childhood to a new chapter with a dialogue, without clear progression or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the historical and philosophical content is unclear in relation to the main narrative about Debby.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from Debby's internal thoughts to a new chapter with a dialogue is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next, especially between the philosophical content and the personal story.
