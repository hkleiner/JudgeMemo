Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the years which immediately followed His departure from Persia, Bahá’u’lláh gave priority..." (sudden shift in subject and tone, inconsistent with the rest of the text)  
- [SPELLING] "Bahá’u’lláh" (while not incorrect, it is an unusual name that may distract readers unfamiliar with it)  
- [SYNTAX] "The sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done, there was exchange of compliments..." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [LEXICON] "tipstaff to the king's majesty" (archaic or obscure phrasing that may confuse modern readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "is not godfather Prévost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of things?" (confusing and grammatically awkward sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unrelated shift to "Bahá’u’lláh" and Bábí community in Baghdad (completely unrelated to the narrative about Rosa Bonheur)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh disrupts the flow and logical progression of the text  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh is unclear in its relevance and purpose within the section  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition or explanation connects the paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh to the rest of the text
