Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The French arms were knowing defeat." (incorrect verb tense)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French armies wheresoever he gave them battle." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "wheresoever" is archaic and may be distracting to modern readers  
- [SYNTAX] "He further saw that work, although they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life liveable to them." (awkward and confusing structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Well might heads be shaken solemnly." (archaic phrasing that is unclear in context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "Political power was in the hands of a genuine aristocracy, who did more to deserve their privileges than any other aristocracy of modern times."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Millet's artistic development to a historical account of the English aristocracy and their role in fighting Napoleon.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Millet's artistic style, historical context, and unrelated political commentary without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the English aristocracy is disconnected from the main topic of Millet and his peasant paintings.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing Millet's "Man with the Hoe" to a philosophical discussion of art and technique is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the importance of understanding the landscape to appreciate Millet's work is somewhat disconnected from the earlier historical and biographical content.
