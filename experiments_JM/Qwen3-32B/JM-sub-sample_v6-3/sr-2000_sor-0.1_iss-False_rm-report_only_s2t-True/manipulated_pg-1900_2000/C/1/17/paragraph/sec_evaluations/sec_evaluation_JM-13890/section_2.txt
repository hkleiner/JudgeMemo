Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Up to the year 597 this Saxon capital, of practically all south-eastern England, was completely heathen, saving only the King's Frankish wife Bertha and Bishop Luidhard..." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "He even provided them with quarters in Canterbury, and in the old church of St. Martin outside the city, where Queen Bertha had been in the habit of worshipping with her chaplain, Augustine and his monks began to preach..." (cumbersome and confusing sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [LEXICON] "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" (awkward and overly poetic phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome..." (cumbersome and wordy)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the introduction about Bahá’u’lláh to a historical account of Canterbury and early Christianity (disconnected ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical details and broader reflections without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] "It seems unlikely that the influence of the queen and her good chaplain should have been entirely without results..." (vague and ambiguous phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the historical narrative to the speculative discussion about St. Martin's church (lack of smooth connection)  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about St. Martin's feels disconnected from the broader narrative about Canterbury's ecclesiastical history  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
