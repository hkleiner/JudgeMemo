  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing teacher qualifications to Reynolds' life in England with no clear connection.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The section on Reynolds feels disconnected from the broader theme of teacher preparation and application.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The final sentence "She had taught for two years and realized the need of further specialization in her chosen field. To obtain this training, she had spent a year's time." is vague and lacks context.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • No smooth transition between the teacher application section and the Reynolds anecdote.
