- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and inconsistent punctuation in complex sentences  
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories." (awkward structure and unclear connection)  
- [LEXICON] "We however who have witnessed the succession of economic crises which attend and follow a great war ought not to forget..." (wordy and archaic phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" (non-standard spelling)  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and topics without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the historical context of the working class and Bradley’s work is not clearly established
