Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." (Awkward phrasing and unclear connection between clauses)  
- [LOGIC] "In the streets of Teheran, Western observers were appalled by scenes of Bábí victims blown from cannon mouths, hacked to death by axes and swords, and led to their deaths with burning candles inserted into open wounds in their bodies." (Graphic and abrupt description with unclear purpose in the narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from a family narrative to a historical and cultural description of Teheran and Bábí victims.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the family narrative to a historical anecdote about Bahá’u’lláh.  
- [SPELLING] "Teheran" is an older or non-standard spelling; "Tehran" is more commonly used.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained shift from a family narrative to a historical and cultural description of Teheran and Bábí victims.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text abruptly transitions from a family story to a historical anecdote about Bahá’u’llah, with no clear connection or context.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Bahá’u’lláh" and the Bábí victims is unclear in its relevance to the rest of the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the family narrative to the historical anecdote is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [CONTEXT] The mention of "Bahá’u’lláh" and the Bábí victims appears out of context and disrupts the flow of the family story.
