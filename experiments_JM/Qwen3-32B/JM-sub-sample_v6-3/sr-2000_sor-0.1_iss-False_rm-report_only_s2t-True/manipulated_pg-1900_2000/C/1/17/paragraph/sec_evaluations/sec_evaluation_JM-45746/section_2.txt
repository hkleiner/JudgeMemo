Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have no preference, for I am as good in one as I am in another." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted..." (awkward and overly wordy)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [LEXICON] "He had met with two unfortunate accidents." (word choice could be improved to "experienced" or "suffered")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had met with two unfortunate accidents. In Minorca..." (missing transition between sentences)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing teacher qualifications to Reynolds' life in England with no clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section on Reynolds feels disconnected from the broader theme of teacher preparation and application.  
- [CLARITY] The final sentence "She had taught for two years and realized the need of further specialization in her chosen field. To obtain this training, she had spent a year's time." is vague and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] No smooth transition between the teacher application section and the Reynolds anecdote.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
