Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "ol which" instead of "of which"  
- [GRAMMAR] "has in North Kansu an E-W direction" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we crossed one of the innumerable etape stations which faithfully follow its course all the way..." (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we rode past the first of the scattered dwellings of the Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu" (redundant phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I dismounted to get a nearer view of three women who were busy in the yard of the house" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The lamas, on their arrival, appeared somewhat surprised at our intrusion but though the first meeting was rather cool, the ice soon was broken" (awkward phrasing and passive voice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "we may walk for a few miles by the side of a river, noting its shallows and its rapids..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "If they were to do nothing else, the effects which Bahá’u’lláh’s life and writings have already had should command the earnest attention..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Lemoyne's studio" (sudden shift in context and style)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in context and style at the end with the mention of "Lemoyne's studio" and "Boucher accounted his fortune made" (irrelevant to the rest of the text)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh seems out of place and unrelated to the rest of the narrative  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of the Yögur village to the philosophical reflection on history and then to the Bahá’u’lláh paragraph  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Shykshatva," "Tshulma," and "Shtsha-ryzyk" is unclear without context  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Industrial Revolution and French monarchy is somewhat disconnected from the main narrative about the Yögur people  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
