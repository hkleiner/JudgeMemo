Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The latter had been a trifle curt." (Ambiguous reference to "latter")  
- [SYNTAX] "The engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life." (Cumbersome phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The utter futility of attempting to make East and West understand each other had stilled her lips..." (Word choice is slightly awkward)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house of one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child..." (Awkward and passive construction)  
- [SPELLING] "mis-handling" (Hyphenation inconsistency)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's story to the birth of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson in Paris (Disjointed transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Jeanne Antoinette Poisson feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative (Lack of integration)  
- [CLARITY] "The latter had been a trifle curt." (Unclear reference to "latter")  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping's decision to the mention of Madame Yen and the pearls is abrupt (Lack of smooth connection)  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Miss Porter and the American girl is followed by a detailed backstory about Madame Yen and the pearls, which lacks a clear narrative link (Disjointed ideas)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
