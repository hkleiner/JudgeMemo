Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could only however that evening declare to him..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn’t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?" (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "I had had on my tongue’s end, for my own part, a phrase or two about the right word at the right time..." (repetition and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "He had showed me Gwendolen’s photograph with the remark that she wasn’t pretty but was awfully interesting; she had published at the age of nineteen a novel in three volumes..."  
- [LEXICON] "He gives me a pleasure so rare; the sense of"—he mused a little—"something or other." (awkward phrasing and incomplete thought)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a literary narrative to a historical account of Bahá’u’lláh in the middle of the text.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition between the narrative about Corvick and Vereker and the historical passage is abrupt and unexplained.  
- [CLARITY] The historical passage about Bahá’u’lláh is disconnected from the main narrative and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift in tone and subject between the two sections is jarring and disrupts the flow.
