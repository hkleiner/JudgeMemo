Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "They were written by devotees. And this age could not have produced them."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "It is due to the labours of a set of idealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything except their ideal."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex vocabulary that may hinder readability for some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and long sentences that may disrupt the flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Christmas hymns to the impact of 19th-century philosophers and scientists.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the critique of the age of scepticism to the mention of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph introduces a new idea (Bahá’u’lláh’s writings) without sufficient context or explanation.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the discussion of Christmas, the age of doubt, and the conclusion about the Christmas spirit.
