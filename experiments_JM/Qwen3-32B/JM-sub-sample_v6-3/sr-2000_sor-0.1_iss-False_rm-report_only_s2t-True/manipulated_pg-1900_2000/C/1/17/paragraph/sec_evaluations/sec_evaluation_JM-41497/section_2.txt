- [LEXICON] Ambiguous or unclear phrasing in "There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene..."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "eighteenth" in "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical."  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Reynolds' personal weaknesses to a comparison with modern figures ("There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,'...")  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph is long and meandering, making it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Reynolds' personal life to a general commentary on biography and public perception  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Lion Comique" and "lady of the music halls" is unclear without additional context
