  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "A biosensor activated with a pulse." – incomplete or misplaced sentence.
        • "The AI assistant adjusted the lights." – abrupt and out of context, likely a misplaced or inserted sentence.
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "tapestried" – uncommon and possibly incorrect word usage.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" – awkward phrasing, unclear meaning.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "biosensor" and "AI assistant" – anachronistic and inconsistent with the historical narrative.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden and unexplained mention of "A biosensor activated with a pulse" and "The AI assistant adjusted the lights" disrupts the narrative flow.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The transition from the detailed description of the jewelry shop to the memory of the mission school is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The phrase "crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" is unclear and does not logically fit the context.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.
