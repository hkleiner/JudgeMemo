Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "So it came about--'twas in that year..." has an awkward and archaic phrasing that disrupts modern fluency.  
- [SYNTAX] "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honor√©, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days." is overly complex and convoluted.  
- [LEXICON] "burst with the shy youth into the studio" is awkward and unclear in phrasing.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas and em dashes disrupts the flow.  
- [SYNTAX] "whilst his mother poured out in the rough accent of Provence the tale of the genius of her son--stole, too, a stealthy scrutiny..." is a run-on sentence with poor structure.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but phrasing issues affect fluency.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between events and descriptions without clear transitions (e.g., from the mother's actions to the studio details).  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and lacks paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, reducing clarity (e.g., the sentence about Boucher's studio and Fragonard's future).  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Fragonard's training to the political events at the end is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Damiens stabbing the king feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about Fragonard.
