Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The 3D printer finished the replica" is a sentence fragment and lacks context.  
- [SYNTAX] "At home education was spreading, liberty was increasing, and the light taxes were raised with an ease." – awkward phrasing and incomplete thought.  
- [LEXICON] "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." – "going concern" is an unusual and jarring term in this context.  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" is an archaic or incorrect spelling; the modern form is "wagon-loads."  
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories." – awkward and confusing structure.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The 3D printer finished the replica" is abrupt and unrelated to the surrounding historical content.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing the effects of war on intellectual life to the condition of the working class, with little transition.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of the 3D printer to the working class and economic conditions is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [CLARITY] The final sentence, "the light taxes were raised with an ease," is unclear and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Macaulay supplies some of the best examples" is vague and lacks elaboration or connection to the surrounding text.
