- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained mention of "A biosensor activated with a pulse" and "The AI assistant adjusted the lights" disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the detailed description of the jewelry shop to the memory of the mission school is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" is unclear and does not logically fit the context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.
