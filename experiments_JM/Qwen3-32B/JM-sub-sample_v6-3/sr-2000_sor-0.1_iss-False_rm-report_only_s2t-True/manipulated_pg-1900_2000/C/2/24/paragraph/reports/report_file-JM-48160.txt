Issues:
  Fluency Issues:

        • "A storage cloud expanded its archive" is a grammatically incomplete and contextually irrelevant sentence.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "I have now been on a number of trips outside of Paris and invariably these stations are packed with men in uniform" has a run-on structure that disrupts flow.

        • No spelling errors detected.

    - [CLARITY]:
