Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was one incarnate Why and How; one brooding wonder and interrogation point." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was generally put under the teacher’s desk for punishment." (passive voice disrupts flow)  
- [LEXICON] "It was a dark close, sultry spot..." (confusing use of "close")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "“_I see a pig_. _The pig is big_. _The big pig can dig_”;" (inconsistent punctuation and formatting)  
- [SPELLING] "There was no spirit in Edgewood bold enough..." (no spelling errors, but awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Anthony's childhood antics to his general laziness and philosophical musings without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Jump from the boy's school behavior to his self-education in the woods with no clear connection  
- [CLARITY] "He was one incarnate Why and How..." is abstract and lacks clear context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the boy's behavior in school to his mother's perspective and knowledge of nature  
- [LOGIC] The philosophical questions are disconnected from the narrative flow and character development  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
