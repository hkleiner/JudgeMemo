Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." (irrelevant and jarring sentence with no connection to the historical context)  
- [SYNTAX] "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it." (awkward use of em dashes and phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The king altered his throne-name, “Amen-hetep,” to “Akhen-Aten,” “The glory of the Sun’s Disk”; his young daughters..." (overuse of quotation marks and inconsistent punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." (completely out of context and disrupts the historical narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed historical analysis and a single modern-sounding sentence, creating a jarring shift in tone and subject.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the historical narrative to the sentence about voice-activated controls is abrupt and illogical.  
- [CLARITY] "The official world promptly broke with the old religion." (vague and lacks explanation of what "broke with the old religion" entails)  
- [LOGIC] "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished." (confusing phrasing that could be interpreted as contradictory)
