- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "He proclaimed 'the gradual growth of all things by natural processes out of natural antecedents'"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Spencer's personal reflections to a broader philosophical debate without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear progression between the discussion of Spencer's contributions and the abstract philosophical conclusion  
- [CLARITY] Vague and abstract statements like "the Unknowableâ€”save the Ultimate Reality in which subject and object are united" hinder clarity  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Spencer's life and work to the final philosophical conclusion without sufficient connection  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of ideas about evolution and law without clear resolution or synthesis
