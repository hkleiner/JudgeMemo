        • Overly complex sentence structure in "the worthy mercer was first in all the little town to know by his modest traffic in them; and that, too, only long after the things they shadowed were buried under new millineries and fopperies and fantastic riot in the gay capital"
        • Awkward phrasing in "the eleven-year-old boy's ears heard of the death of the minister"
        • Confusing structure in "He recovered, to enter Paris soon after as the Well-Beloved, and to be reconciled with the frail Chateauroux before she died in the sudden agony in which she swore she had been poisoned"
        • Awkward phrasing in "A storage cloud expanded its archive"

  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "So it came about--'twas in that year..." has an awkward and archaic phrasing that disrupts modern fluency.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honoré, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days." is overly complex and convoluted.
        • "whilst his mother poured out in the rough accent of Provence the tale of the genius of her son--stole, too, a stealthy scrutiny..." is a run-on sentence with poor structure.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "burst with the shy youth into the studio" is awkward and unclear in phrasing.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Excessive use of commas and em dashes disrupts the flow.
    - [SPELLING]:
        • No spelling errors detected, but phrasing issues affect fluency.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The narrative jumps between events and descriptions without clear transitions (e.g., from the mother's actions to the studio details).
        • The mention of Damiens stabbing the king feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about Fragonard.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text is dense and lacks paragraph breaks, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, reducing clarity (e.g., the sentence about Boucher's studio and Fragonard's future).
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from Fragonard's training to the political events at the end is abrupt and lacks context.
