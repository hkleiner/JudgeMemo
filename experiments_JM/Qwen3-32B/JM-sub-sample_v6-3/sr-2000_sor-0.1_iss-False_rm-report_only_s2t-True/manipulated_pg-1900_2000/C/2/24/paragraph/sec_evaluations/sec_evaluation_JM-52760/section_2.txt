Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The surveillance drone made no sound" is an isolated sentence that appears out of context and disrupts the historical narrative.  
- [SPELLING] "Jordon Point" is likely a misspelling of "Jordan Point."  
- [SYNTAX] "A signal booster amplified the stream" is vague and lacks context, making it syntactically disconnected from the surrounding text.  
- [LEXICON] "The infantry contented itself with a menacing demonstration" uses "contented" in a non-standard way, which may confuse readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "Maj." in "Maj. Gen. W. F. 'Baldy' Smith" disrupts the flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The surveillance drone made no sound" is an anachronism and does not logically fit in a historical account of the Civil War.  
- [STRUCTURE] The sentence "A signal booster amplified the stream" is similarly anachronistic and disrupts the logical flow of the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the Dimmock Line to the Battle of Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the stream" in "A signal booster amplified the stream" is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to understand its relevance.  
- [CONTEXT] The text references "the stream" without prior definition, leading to confusion about what is being amplified.
