Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "They would leave naught alone; and they scorned consequences."  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly complex words like "ebullition," "lyricism," and "fearsomely" may disrupt readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and em dashes in complex sentences may hinder flow.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical awkwardness in "It is due to the labours of a set of idealists--men who cared not for money..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Christmas hymns to the impact of 19th-century scientists may confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the critique of scepticism to the conclusion about the Christmas spirit.  
- [CLARITY] The argument is complex and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression at times.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the "age of scepticism" is long and could benefit from clearer segmentation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
