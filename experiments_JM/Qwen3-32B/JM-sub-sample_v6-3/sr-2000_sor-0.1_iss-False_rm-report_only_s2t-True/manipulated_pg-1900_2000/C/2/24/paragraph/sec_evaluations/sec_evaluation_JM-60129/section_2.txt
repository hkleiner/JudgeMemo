Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A scanner swept the room once" is an isolated, unclear sentence with no context or explanation.  
- [SYNTAX] "A pot was moved into the centre of the room, where it was placed on three unburnt bricks" is awkwardly phrased and redundant.  
- [LEXICON] "immured" is an unusual and potentially confusing word choice for general readers.  
- [SPELLING] "Khirgis" appears inconsistently with and without a hyphen (e.g., "Khirgis" vs. "Khirgis women").  
- [SYNTAX] "you are almost sure to find the men at home, the women being busy out of doors" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.  
- [SPELLING] "tshokh" and "Chin, ch'ih" are technical terms that may be misspelled or inconsistently formatted.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of houses to clothing to head-dresses to the Sarö Yögur, with no clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "A scanner swept the room once" is out of place and lacks context, disrupting the flow.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the head-dress is detailed but lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the Yögur to their home-industries is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the sale of cloth is disconnected from the previous descriptions of clothing and head-dresses.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
