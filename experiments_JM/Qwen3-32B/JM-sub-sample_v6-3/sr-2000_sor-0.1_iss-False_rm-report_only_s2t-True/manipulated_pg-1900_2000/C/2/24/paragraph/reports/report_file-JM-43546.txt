Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "A wireless charger powered up" is a sentence fragment.
        • "The AI assistant adjusted the lights" is a sentence fragment.
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "laddies" is used consistently but may be considered dialectal or archaic.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened, and quickly leaped over the wall" has a run-on sentence.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing comma after introductory phrases in several sentences.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden mention of "A wireless charger powered up" and "The AI assistant adjusted the lights" disrupts the narrative flow.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text shifts abruptly from a 19th-century Scottish narrative to modern technological elements.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from the story of the puppy to descriptions of Scottish food is jarring and lacks smooth connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The inclusion of modern elements (wireless charger, AI assistant) creates confusion about the time period and context.

Section section_02 (Chars 8029–11889):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "He wanted to enjoy it in Scotland, his own country, however, for the Scotch are very clannish..." (awkward placement of "however")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "He had gone to America when he was a young lad, and had made a great fortune in copper mines." (repetition of "had" is unnecessary and awkward)
        • "Donald never tired of hearing his uncle tell of his life and adventures in the far-away Western States of America, which seemed always to him to belong to another world." (awkward phrasing: "seemed always to him")
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • "So he came back to Scotland, and bought a fine estate with a beautiful house, into which he put handsome furniture and good pictures and books,--everything that could make a home attractive." (misuse of em dash after comma)
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "doggie" (informal and inconsistent with rest of text tone)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from the boys' excitement about their cousins to detailed descriptions of Uncle Alan's estate and adventures, with no clear transition
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The paragraph about Donald rushing home from school and naming the puppy feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about Uncle Alan and the estate
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The mention of "Kelvin House" and the puppy's naming is confusing in context, as it appears unrelated to the earlier discussion of Uncle Alan and the Highlands
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The paragraph about Donald's adventures with Dugald and the gamekeeper is inserted without a clear link to the surrounding text
