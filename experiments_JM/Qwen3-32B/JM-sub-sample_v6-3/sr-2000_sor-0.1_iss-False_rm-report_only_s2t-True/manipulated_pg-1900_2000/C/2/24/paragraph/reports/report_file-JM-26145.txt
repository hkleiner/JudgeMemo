        • The reference to "Pharaoh" and its absence in the Tell el Amarna documents is not clearly explained
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The final paragraph of Chapter I jumps from scribes to the physical characteristics of the tablets without smooth transition

    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • "The king altered his throne-name, “Amen-hetep,” to “Akhen-Aten,” “The glory of the Sun’s Disk”; his young daughters..." (overuse of quotation marks and inconsistent punctuation)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • "The voice-activated controls blinked to life." (completely out of context and disrupts the historical narrative)
        • "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished." (confusing phrasing that could be interpreted as contradictory)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between detailed historical analysis and a single modern-sounding sentence, creating a jarring shift in tone and subject.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from the historical narrative to the sentence about voice-activated controls is abrupt and illogical.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "The official world promptly broke with the old religion." (vague and lacks explanation of what "broke with the old religion" entails)
