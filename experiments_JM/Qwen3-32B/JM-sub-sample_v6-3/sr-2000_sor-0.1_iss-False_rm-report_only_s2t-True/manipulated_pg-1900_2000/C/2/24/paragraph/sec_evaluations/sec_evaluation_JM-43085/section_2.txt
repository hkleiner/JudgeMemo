1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions" is an anachronistic and contextually irrelevant phrase.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." – this sentence is grammatically awkward and confusing.  
- [LEXICON] "The auto-cleaning system activated." – another anachronistic and contextually irrelevant phrase.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" – grammatically incorrect and confusing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "Is there any need of saying that the public failed to distinguish a work which did not sufficiently distinguish itself?" – awkward and confusing phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "A deepfake filter rendered new expressions" and "The auto-cleaning system activated" are completely out of place and disrupt the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps abruptly from Meissonier's artistic development to irrelevant technological references, breaking the logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence about the master working on the ceiling painting and hiring soldiers is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between detailed descriptions of Meissonier's early career and irrelevant, disjointed phrases, making the structure inconsistent.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the historical narrative to the anachronistic phrases is jarring and lacks smooth connection.
