- [LOGIC] The transition from describing the village to the temple is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The legend of Shiche-Hache is introduced without clear connection to the preceding description of the village.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the description of the temple to the administrative structure is abrupt and lacks transitional phrases.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the lamas' written language and their inability to decipher a document is introduced without clear context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the local administration feels disconnected from the earlier descriptions of the village and temple.
