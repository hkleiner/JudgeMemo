  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "The voice recognition module powered up" is a sentence that appears out of context and disrupts the flow of the text.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "He could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--"dress sense." has awkward phrasing and a misplaced modifier.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "He said he didn't know, but he wanted the job that paid the most money" uses informal language that contrasts with the formal tone of the rest of the text.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • The use of em dashes in "one of the first requisites of business--"dress sense." is inconsistent with the rest of the text's punctuation style.
  Coherence Issues:

        • The sudden appearance of "The voice recognition module powered up" disrupts the logical flow of the text and has no clear connection to the surrounding content.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text shifts abruptly from discussing teacher qualifications to a completely unrelated statement about a voice recognition module.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from discussing teacher qualifications to the story about the young man seeking a promotion is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The final paragraph about the young woman who had spent a year's time on further specialization is cut off mid-idea, leaving the reader with an incomplete thought.
