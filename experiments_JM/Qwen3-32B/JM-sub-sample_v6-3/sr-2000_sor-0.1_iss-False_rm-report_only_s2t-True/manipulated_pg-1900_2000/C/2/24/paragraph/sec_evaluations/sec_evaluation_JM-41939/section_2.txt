Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Not long after this, a serious and determined young girl might be seen in the halls of the Louvre..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The students and copyists who regularly frequented the museum, not knowing her name, had christened her 'the little hussard.'" (cumbersome structure)  
- [SPELLING] "The jests and criticisms flung out by passing strangers in regard to her work..." (redundant phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The hours which she did not consecrate to the Louvre, she spent in her father's studio..." (awkward word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "Even at this period she had already grasped instinctively the truth formulated by Ingres..." (awkward sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty, this conscientiousness, without which the most gifted artist remains incomplete." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Whatever gifts he may be endowed with by nature, talent cannot be improvised..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Later on, when she in her turn became a teacher, Rosa Bonheur was able to proclaim the necessity of line-work..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch." (incongruous and irrelevant sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "This is how she came to acquire her clever talent for sculpture which would have sufficed to establish a reputation if she had not become the admirable painter that we know her to have been." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "At last, in 1841, after years of devoted toil, Rosa ventured to offer to the Salon a little painting representing Two Rabbits and a drawing depicting some Dogs and Sheep." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The latter were soon forced to admire the intense relief of her method of painting, living animals transcribed in full action..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Every morning, the young artist made the rounds of slaughter-houses, markets, the Museum, anywhere and everywhere that she might see and study animals." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch." (incongruous and irrelevant to the narrative)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from Rosa's early artistic development to the irrelevant "smartwatch" sentence disrupts the flow.  
- [CLARITY] "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty, this conscientiousness, without which the most gifted artist remains incomplete." (confusing and abstract phrasing)  
- [LOGIC] The sentence about the "smartwatch" is anachronistic and disrupts the historical narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Rosa's artistic development to the irrelevant sentence is jarring and lacks logical connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the "smartwatch" is out of place and breaks the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence about the "smartwatch" is not connected to the rest of the text and appears to be an error or intrusion.
