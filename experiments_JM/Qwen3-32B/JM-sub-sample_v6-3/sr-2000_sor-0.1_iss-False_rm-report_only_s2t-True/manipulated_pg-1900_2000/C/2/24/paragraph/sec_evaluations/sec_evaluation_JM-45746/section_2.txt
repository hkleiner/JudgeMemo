Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The voice recognition module powered up" is a sentence that appears out of context and disrupts the flow of the text.
- [SYNTAX] "He could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--"dress sense." has awkward phrasing and a misplaced modifier.
- [LEXICON] "He said he didn't know, but he wanted the job that paid the most money" uses informal language that contrasts with the formal tone of the rest of the text.
- [PUNCTUATION] The use of em dashes in "one of the first requisites of business--"dress sense." is inconsistent with the rest of the text's punctuation style.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "The voice recognition module powered up" disrupts the logical flow of the text and has no clear connection to the surrounding content.
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from discussing teacher qualifications to a completely unrelated statement about a voice recognition module.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing teacher qualifications to the story about the young man seeking a promotion is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the young woman who had spent a year's time on further specialization is cut off mid-idea, leaving the reader with an incomplete thought.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
