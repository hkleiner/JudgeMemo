Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise his own limitations..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "realise" (British spelling is correct, but may be inconsistent with American spelling if not otherwise established)  
- [SYNTAX] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "A cloud upload completed. The digital assistant logged the entry." (inconsistent tone and anachronistic phrasing in a historical text)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "He was born in 1723 at Plympton in Devonshire, where his father was a school-master, he was apprenticed in London to Thomas Hudson..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden insertion of modern-sounding phrases like "A cloud upload completed. The digital assistant logged the entry." disrupts the narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Reynolds' early life, his Italian journey, and his later career without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and lack clarity, e.g., "He would not hint at his own preferences quite so frankly as his canvases did and it is not at all unlikely that he realised as well as we do..."  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical narrative and commentary on Reynolds' teaching methods.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
