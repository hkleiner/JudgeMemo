- [SYNTAX] "he may be a book huckster or his books may be those without which a gentlemanâ€™s library is not complete" (complex sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "fourpence-halfpenny" (archaic term that may be unfamiliar to modern readers)
- [LEXICON] "trifle with literature" (ambiguous phrasing)
- [PUNCTUATION] "he desired to create an atmosphere, and so he proposed with a certain imposing air that we should visit what he called 'my library.'" (long sentence with multiple clauses)
- [GRAMMAR] "As he was to preside at a lecture I was delivering he had in his courtesy invited me to dinner" (missing comma after introductory clause)

- [LOGIC] The text sometimes makes abrupt shifts in focus (e.g., from discussing bookmen to mentioning a surveillance camera)
- [STRUCTURE] The conclusion about bookmen is not clearly tied to the preceding examples
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "The bookman will of course upon occasion trifle with various kinds of reading" is somewhat ambiguous
- [LOGIC] The comparison between detective stories and classic literature is not fully developed
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Mark Rutherford seems disconnected from the previous discussion
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Mystery of a Hansom Cab" and "John Inglesant" may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with these works
