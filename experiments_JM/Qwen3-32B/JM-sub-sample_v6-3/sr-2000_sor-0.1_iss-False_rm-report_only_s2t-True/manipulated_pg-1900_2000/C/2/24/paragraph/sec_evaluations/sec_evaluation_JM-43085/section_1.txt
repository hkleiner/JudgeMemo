Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "A phone rang from across the room." (incongruous and grammatically misplaced sentence)
- [SPELLING] "1807, of how standing grain looks..." (awkward placement of year)
- [SYNTAX] "The lives of all beloved and admired artists have this in common with fairy tales: they always begin badly and end happily (unluckily, they sometimes end a long time after the death of the principal hero!)" (awkward parenthetical insertion)
- [LEXICON] "The press, the art clubs, not to mention the salons, were all more or less divided between the romantics and the classicists, the innovators and the traditionalists, and fanned the flames of a quarrel which, in view of the worth of the two leaders--one of whom spelled genius and the other perfection--was destined to appear without sanction to the eyes of posterity." (complex sentence with confusing phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden and unexplained reference to "A phone rang from across the room" (incongruous with the historical narrative)
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narrative styles and time periods without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] The comparison between Delacroix and Meissonier is somewhat confusing in its execution
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about Meissonier's childhood to his father's concerns is abrupt

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
