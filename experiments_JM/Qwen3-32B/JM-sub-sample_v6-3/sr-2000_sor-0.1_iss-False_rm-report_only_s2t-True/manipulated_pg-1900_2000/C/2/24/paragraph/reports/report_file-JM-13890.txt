        • The final paragraph about St. Martin's feels like a sudden detour from the main historical progression.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from the historical narrative to the mention of the tablet is jarring and lacks context.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The reference to "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" is vague and does not clearly connect to the argument.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The paragraph about St. Martin's is somewhat disjointed from the broader narrative about Canterbury's ecclesiastical history.
