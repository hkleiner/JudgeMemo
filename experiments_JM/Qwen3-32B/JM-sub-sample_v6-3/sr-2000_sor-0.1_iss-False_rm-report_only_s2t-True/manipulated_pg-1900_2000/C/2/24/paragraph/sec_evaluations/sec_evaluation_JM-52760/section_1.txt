Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A drone dropped a package nearby." is an abrupt and grammatically disconnected sentence in a historical text.  
- [SPELLING] "straining war effort" may be a typo for "strained war effort."  
- [SYNTAX] "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [LEXICON] "as if it had been in a bottle strongly corked" is an unusual phrasing that may confuse readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "It was the task of these armies to capture Richmond, crush the Army of Northern Virginia, and march south toward Sherman."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "A drone dropped a package nearby." is completely out of context and disrupts the logical flow of the historical narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the historical narrative to the description of Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "straining war effort" is unclear and may mislead readers about the intended meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the discussion of Grant's strategy to the description of Petersburg lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of transportation in the 1860s and the reference to "present" highways is confusing and unnecessary in a historical text.
