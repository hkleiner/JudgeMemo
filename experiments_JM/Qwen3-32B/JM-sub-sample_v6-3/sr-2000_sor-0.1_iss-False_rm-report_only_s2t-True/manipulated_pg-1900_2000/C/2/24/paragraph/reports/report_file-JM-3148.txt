Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Inconsistent use of quotation marks and punctuation within dialogue
        • Inconsistent spacing before punctuation marks
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "nunky" appears to be a non-standard or misspelled word
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "The energy grid remained balanced" and "A contactless payment completed" which seem out of place
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "Pag-pag" and "Pag-a-ni-ni’s" appear to be incorrectly hyphenated or misspelled names
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden, unexplained references to "The energy grid" and "A contactless payment" that seem anachronistic for the 19th-century setting
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The story shifts abruptly from a narrative about a blind violinist to these modern references
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The purpose of the strange modern references is unclear and disrupts the narrative flow
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Poor transition between the narrative about Anthony Croft and the anachronistic elements

Section section_02 (Chars 8031–11639):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "He was one incarnate Why and How; one brooding wonder and interrogation point." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "He was generally put under the teacher’s desk for punishment." (passive voice disrupts flow)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "It was a dark close, sultry spot..." (confusing use of "close")
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • "“_I see a pig_. _The pig is big_. _The big pig can dig_”;" (inconsistent punctuation and formatting)
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "There was no spirit in Edgewood bold enough..." (no spelling errors, but awkward phrasing)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from Anthony's childhood antics to his general laziness and philosophical musings without clear transition
        • The philosophical questions are disconnected from the narrative flow and character development
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Jump from the boy's school behavior to his self-education in the woods with no clear connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "He was one incarnate Why and How..." is abstract and lacks clear context
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the boy's behavior in school to his mother's perspective and knowledge of nature
