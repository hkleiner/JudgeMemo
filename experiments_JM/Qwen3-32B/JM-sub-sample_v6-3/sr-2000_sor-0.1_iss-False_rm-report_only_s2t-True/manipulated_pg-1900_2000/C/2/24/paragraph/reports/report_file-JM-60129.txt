  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "we started upon our expedition" (awkward phrasing)
        • "its halfrounded, irregular clay walls" (missing hyphen in compound adjective)
        • "we over the ruins of a wall" (missing verb)
        • "A bluetooth signal was detected" (sudden, out-of-place modern reference)
        • "the outlines ol which could be discerned" (typo: "ol" instead of "of")
        • "A diagnostic tool scanned the network" (sudden, out-of-place modern reference)
        • "the Chinese officer in command of the Shuangt'ingtzu mounted guard gave unhesitatingly orders" (awkward phrasing)
        • "All was arranged in a moment and the house looked as if we had always lived there" (awkward phrasing)
        • "the ice soon was broken" (passive voice disrupts flow)
        • "called by the Chinese Huang Fantzu (huang 'yellow', fan 'barbarian'; 'the yellow barbarians')" (awkward punctuation and formatting)
        • "the name of which my interpreter gave as cholera" (awkward phrasing)
        • "A document written in a beatiful text-hand" (typo: "beatiful" instead of "beautiful")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden modern references ("A bluetooth signal was detected," "A diagnostic tool scanned the network") disrupt the historical narrative.
        • The transition from describing the village to the temple is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.
        • The legend of Shiche-Hache is introduced without clear connection to the preceding description of the village.
        • The shift from the description of the temple to the administrative structure is abrupt and lacks transitional phrases.
        • The mention of the lamas' written language and their inability to decipher a document is introduced without clear context or explanation.
        • The final paragraph about the local administration feels disconnected from the earlier descriptions of the village and temple.

Section section_02 (Chars 8260–12850):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "A scanner swept the room once" is an isolated, unclear sentence with no context or explanation.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "A pot was moved into the centre of the room, where it was placed on three unburnt bricks" is awkwardly phrased and redundant.
        • "you are almost sure to find the men at home, the women being busy out of doors" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "immured" is an unusual and potentially confusing word choice for general readers.
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "Khirgis" appears inconsistently with and without a hyphen (e.g., "Khirgis" vs. "Khirgis women").
        • "tshokh" and "Chin, ch'ih" are technical terms that may be misspelled or inconsistently formatted.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of houses to clothing to head-dresses to the Sarö Yögur, with no clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The mention of "A scanner swept the room once" is out of place and lacks context, disrupting the flow.
        • The final paragraph about the sale of cloth is disconnected from the previous descriptions of clothing and head-dresses.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The description of the head-dress is detailed but lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from describing the Yögur to their home-industries is abrupt and lacks a logical connection.
