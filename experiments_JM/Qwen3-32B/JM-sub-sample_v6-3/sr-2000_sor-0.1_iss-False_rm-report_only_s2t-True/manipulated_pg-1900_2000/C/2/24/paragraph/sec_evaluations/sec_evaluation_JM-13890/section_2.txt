Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "A tablet lit up on the table" is a sentence fragment.  
- [SYNTAX] "if Bede may be trusted for a topographical detail of this character" is awkward and overly wordy.  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" is misspelled (incorrect character encoding).  
- [LEXICON] "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" is overly poetic and slightly unclear.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "As the first church mentioned in history associated with Christian worship St. Martin's..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "A tablet lit up on the table" is abrupt and unrelated to the surrounding historical narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical narrative to the mention of the tablet is jarring and lacks context.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" is vague and does not clearly connect to the argument.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about St. Martin's is somewhat disjointed from the broader narrative about Canterbury's ecclesiastical history.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about St. Martin's feels like a sudden detour from the main historical progression.
