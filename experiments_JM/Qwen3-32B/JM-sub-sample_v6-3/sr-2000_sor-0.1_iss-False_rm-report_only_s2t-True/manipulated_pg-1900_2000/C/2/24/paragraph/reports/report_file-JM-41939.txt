        • "Even at this period she had already grasped instinctively the truth formulated by Ingres..." (awkward sentence structure)
        • "This is how she came to acquire her clever talent for sculpture which would have sufficed to establish a reputation if she had not become the admirable painter that we know her to have been." (cumbersome and overly complex sentence)

    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The transition from Rosa's early artistic development to the irrelevant "smartwatch" sentence disrupts the flow.
        • The paragraph about the "smartwatch" is out of place and breaks the narrative flow.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty, this conscientiousness, without which the most gifted artist remains incomplete." (confusing and abstract phrasing)
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from Rosa's artistic development to the irrelevant sentence is jarring and lacks logical connection.
