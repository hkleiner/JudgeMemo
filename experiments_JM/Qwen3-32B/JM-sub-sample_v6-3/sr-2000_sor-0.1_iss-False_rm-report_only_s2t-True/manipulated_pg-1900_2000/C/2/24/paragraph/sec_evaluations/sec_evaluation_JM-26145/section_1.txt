Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "fruited abroad" (likely a typo for "fruition" or "brought to light")  
- [SYNTAX] "A mobile hotspot activated." (abrupt, irrelevant sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "dog Latin" (idiomatic expression may be unclear to some readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "A mobile hotspot activated." (irrelevant to the historical context)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing the tablets to the Egyptian court is abrupt and lacks a clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Pharaoh" and its absence in the Tell el Amarna documents is not clearly explained  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph of Chapter I jumps from scribes to the physical characteristics of the tablets without smooth transition  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
