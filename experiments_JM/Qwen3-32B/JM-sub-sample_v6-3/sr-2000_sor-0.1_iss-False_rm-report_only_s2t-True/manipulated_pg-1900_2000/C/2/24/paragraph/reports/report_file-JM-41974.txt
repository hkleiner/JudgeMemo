Issues:

    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "A GPS signal recalibrated" appears out of context and is grammatically disconnected.

        • "Caliari" is inconsistently used (once as "Caliari" and once as "Veronese").

    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative shifts abruptly from a historical account to anachronistic technological references.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The use of "Caliari" without clear explanation or connection to the main narrative is confusing.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from the historical narrative to the anachronistic phrases is jarring and lacks any logical or thematic connection.
