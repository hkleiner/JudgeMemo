2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Kuei Ping's memory of graduation to the present moment with Madame Yen is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between past and present without clear markers, making it difficult to follow the timeline.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "The latter had been a trifke curt" is unclear without more context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Kuei Ping's internal conflict to the external scene with Madame Yen and the tea is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the chair-bearers feels disconnected from the emotional and narrative arc of the story.
