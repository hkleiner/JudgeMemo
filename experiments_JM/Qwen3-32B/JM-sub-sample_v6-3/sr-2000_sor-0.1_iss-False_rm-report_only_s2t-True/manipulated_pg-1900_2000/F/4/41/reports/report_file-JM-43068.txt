        • "an exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." (subject-verb agreement)
        • "the same incisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the Dutchmen..." (subject-verb agreement)
        • "The entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to be accounted for,vfirstly..." (punctuation and word order)
        • "the train of thought of the two masters seems to run ipon parallel lines." (word choice and preposition)
        • "It is to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did." (awkward phrasing)
        • "It must never be forgottsn that in considering the oil paintings of Millet..." (awkward phrasing)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between historical context and analysis of Millet's work without clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The argument about Millet's connection to Brueghel and the Dutch school is occasionally unclear or abrupt.
        • The conclusion that Millet will "never occupy a very high position in the world of art" is abrupt and lacks sufficient support from the preceding argument.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are overly long and complex, making the meaning difficult to follow.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from discussing Brueghel to Millet lacks a smooth transition.

        • "how much corn can be raised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how much mutton it will make" (awkward and run-on phrasing)
        • "how the bluss get fainter and fainter" (subject-verb agreement issue)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing Millet's philosophy to a detailed description of "The Sheep Pen" without clear transition
        • The final paragraph about the shepherd and the sunset is rich in imagery but lacks a clear connection to the broader argument about Millet's art
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "He is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him" is vague and confusing in context
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the description of "La Baigneuse" to Millet's philosophical nature
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The paragraph about "The Sheep Pen" is overly long and lacks clear segmentation of ideas
