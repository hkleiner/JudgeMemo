2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between abstract philosophical concepts and specific references without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are convoluted and lack clarity, such as "what more is required to round off the explanation of every thing, save the Unknowable."  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the "Unknowable" is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about the unification of knowledge and the role of Matter, Motion, and Force is presented without sufficient explanation or context.
