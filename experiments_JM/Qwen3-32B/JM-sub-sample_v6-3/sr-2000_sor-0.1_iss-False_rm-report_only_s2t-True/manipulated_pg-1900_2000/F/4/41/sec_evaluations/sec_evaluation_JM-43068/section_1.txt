- [LOGIC] The argument about Millet's connection to Brueghel and the Dutch school is occasionally unclear or abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making the meaning difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Brueghel to Millet lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion that Millet will "never occupy a very high position in the world of art" is abrupt and lacks sufficient support from the preceding argument.
