2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a dense philosophical and theological discussion that may be challenging for some readers to follow due to its abstract nature and complex ideas.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and complex, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas.
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the historical context of materialism to the current resurgence of religious anxiety could be clearer.
- [TRANSITION] The connection between the global crisis in the non-Western world and the current resurgence of religious importance is somewhat abrupt.
