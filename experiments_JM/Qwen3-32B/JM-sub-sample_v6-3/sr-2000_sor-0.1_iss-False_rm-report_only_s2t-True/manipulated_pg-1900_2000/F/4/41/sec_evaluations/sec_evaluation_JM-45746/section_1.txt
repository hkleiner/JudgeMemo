2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narratives (the author's experience and the two young men's experiences) without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The connection between the author's personal experience and the broader discussion about teaching as a profession is not always clear.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making it difficult to follow the main points.
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the first young man's story and the second young man's story is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
