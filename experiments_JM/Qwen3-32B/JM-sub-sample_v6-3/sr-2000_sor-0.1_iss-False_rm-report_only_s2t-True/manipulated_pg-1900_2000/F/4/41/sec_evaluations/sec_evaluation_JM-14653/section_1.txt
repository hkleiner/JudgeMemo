- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing Christmas traditions to discussing children's role in maintaining traditions is somewhat abrupt
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are complex and could be clearer, such as "the peculiarities of our attitude towards Christmas"
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Christmas to comparing it with summer holidays is somewhat jarring without more transitional language
- [LOGIC] The argument about Christmas being originally created for adults rather than children is presented but not fully developed
