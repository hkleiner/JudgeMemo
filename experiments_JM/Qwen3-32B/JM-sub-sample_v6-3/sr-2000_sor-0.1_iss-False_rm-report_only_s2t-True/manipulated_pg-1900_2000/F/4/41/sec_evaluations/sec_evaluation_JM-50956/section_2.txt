- [LOGIC] Repetition of the idea that Russia's early involvement was critical, but not clearly connected to the broader argument  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical events (e.g., the Battle of the Marne, Russian mobilization, Ludendorf's memoirs) without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] The argument about the Moltke plan and its failure is somewhat convoluted and lacks a clear progression
