  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text is a dense philosophical and theological discussion that may be challenging for some readers to follow due to its abstract nature and complex ideas.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are long and complex, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The transition from discussing the historical context of materialism to the current resurgence of religious anxiety could be clearer.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The connection between the global crisis in the non-Western world and the current resurgence of religious importance is somewhat abrupt.

        • The transition from the discussion of social and economic development to the final sentence is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link.
