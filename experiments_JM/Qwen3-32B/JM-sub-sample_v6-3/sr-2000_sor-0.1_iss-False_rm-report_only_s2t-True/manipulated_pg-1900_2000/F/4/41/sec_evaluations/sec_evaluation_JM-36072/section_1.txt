2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is a dense historical analysis with many ideas introduced and developed, but some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt or unclear.  
- [LOGIC] Some historical claims are made without sufficient explanation or context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.  
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses complex or archaic phrasing that may obscure meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without clear links to the previous content, making the flow less smooth.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "the Victorian Age" is introduced late in the text, and the connection to the earlier historical analysis is not always clear.
