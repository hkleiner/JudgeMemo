  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between different narratives (the author's experience and the two young men's experiences) without clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The connection between the author's personal experience and the broader discussion about teaching as a profession is not always clear.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences are overly long and complex, making it difficult to follow the main points.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition between the first young man's story and the second young man's story is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
