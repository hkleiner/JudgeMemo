  Coherence Issues:

        • Sudden introduction of an Earthgirl character without prior setup or connection to main narrative
        • Sudden shift to Sally Englander in the kitchen without clear narrative transition
        • Sudden ending with Sally's question and Englander's response, which feels abrupt and disconnected from the main plot
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Confusing references to "the Polaris" and its status without clear resolution
        • Unclear connection between Ramsey's personal situation and the broader political context of planetarization
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Disjointed narrative flow between different characters and locations
        • Lack of clear progression in the story, with multiple subplots introduced but not fully developed
