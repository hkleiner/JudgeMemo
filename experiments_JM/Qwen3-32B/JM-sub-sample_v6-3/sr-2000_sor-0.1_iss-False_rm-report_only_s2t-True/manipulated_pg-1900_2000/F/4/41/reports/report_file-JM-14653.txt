  Coherence Issues:

        • The argument about Christmas being originally created for adults rather than children is presented but not fully developed
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some phrases are complex and could be clearer, such as "the peculiarities of our attitude towards Christmas"
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from discussing Christmas to comparing it with summer holidays is somewhat jarring without more transitional language
