  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shifts in focus between descriptions of the landscape and the Yögur village without clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Some sentences are disconnected from the main narrative, such as the mention of the lamas' houses and their activities without clear links to the broader context.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous references to "they" and "them" in some sentences, making it unclear who is being referred to.
        • Unclear or confusing phrasing in sentences like "the ruin near the present temple had belonged to a race of people, having tails, whom the Chinese call Kuzurkei."
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from the description of the village to the legend of the Yögurs' origin without a clear narrative link.

  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between descriptions of different aspects (clothing, homes, daily life) without clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The description of the women's head-dress is detailed but lacks a clear progression or explanation of its cultural significance.
        • The mention of selling cloth in Hsuchow and Kanchow is introduced without clear context or explanation of its significance.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The final paragraph about the Sarö Yögur is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear focus.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from describing the Yögur to their clothing and then to their daily life is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.
