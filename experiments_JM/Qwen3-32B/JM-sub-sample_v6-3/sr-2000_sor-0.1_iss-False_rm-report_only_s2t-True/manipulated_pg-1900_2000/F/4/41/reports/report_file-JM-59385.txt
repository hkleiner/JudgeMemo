        • "Kuei Ping had held her breath lest she lose a word while Miss Porter talked, quiet at first, carried away by the marvel of the opportunity, then very still because she knew its impossibility.mFor" (run-on sentence and missing space between "impossibility" and "For")
        • "had given hermthe engagement gifts" (missing space between "her" and "the")

  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The transition from Kuei Ping's memory of graduation to the present moment with Madame Yen is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
        • The final paragraph about the chair-bearers feels disconnected from the emotional and narrative arc of the story.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative jumps between past and present without clear markers, making it difficult to follow the timeline.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The meaning of "The latter had been a trifke curt" is unclear without more context.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The shift from Kuei Ping's internal conflict to the external scene with Madame Yen and the tea is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.
