2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the introduction to the "First Years" chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the register of deaths" to verify Veronese's birth year, but the logic of using a death register for this purpose is unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "He was born at Verona in 1528 and not in 1530, as is asserted by several of his biographers" is confusing due to the lack of explanation for the discrepancy.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Veronese's family background to his artistic training is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The text mentions Veronese's early fascination with DÃ¼rer and Van Leyden but does not clearly explain how this influenced his later work.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "He painted the saintly anchorite defending himself against the blows which the Devil is dealing him with a stick and repulsing the advances of a woman who has been raised up from hell itself to tempt him" is overly complex and difficult to follow.
