2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Millet's philosophy to a detailed description of "The Sheep Pen" without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] "He is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him" is vague and confusing in context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of "La Baigneuse" to Millet's philosophical nature  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about "The Sheep Pen" is overly long and lacks clear segmentation of ideas  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the shepherd and the sunset is rich in imagery but lacks a clear connection to the broader argument about Millet's art
