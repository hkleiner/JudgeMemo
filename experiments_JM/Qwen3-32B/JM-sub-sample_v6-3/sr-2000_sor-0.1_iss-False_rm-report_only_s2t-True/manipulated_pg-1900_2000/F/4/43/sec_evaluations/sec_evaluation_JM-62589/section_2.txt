- [GRAMMAR] "Closing sank window to she began down door and in real the the think near earnest." (Multiple grammatical errors and incoherent phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "She gathered herself up and turned a set, white face to her mistress." (Awkward syntax and phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "The day wore wearily away." (While not a spelling error, the phrasing is awkward and unclear)  
- [LEXICON] "I’ve aired my bed," answered she. (Unnatural word order for modern readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "Closing sank window to she began down door and in real the the think near earnest." (Sentence is incoherent and lacks proper structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Debby’s punishment to her internal thoughts is abrupt and lacks smooth progression.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph begins with a disjointed sentence that breaks the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The line "Closing sank window to she began down door and in real the the think near earnest" is unclear and disrupts the narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Debby’s thoughts about her father to the mention of the battles at Lexington and Bunker Hill is abrupt and lacks contextual connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the battles seems to come out of nowhere and is not clearly tied to Debby’s emotional state or the narrative.
