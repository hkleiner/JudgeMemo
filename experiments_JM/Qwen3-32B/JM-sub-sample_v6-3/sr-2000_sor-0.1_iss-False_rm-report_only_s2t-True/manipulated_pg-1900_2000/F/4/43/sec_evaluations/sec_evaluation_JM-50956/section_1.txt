Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "The population of Germany was 70 million and that of Austria-Hungary 52 million, a total of 122 million persons." (Missing preposition or article for clarity)  
- [SPELLING] "Austro-Hungary" is inconsistently written as "Austro-Hungary" and "Austria-Hungary" in different parts of the text.  
- [SYNTAX] "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army, and three-four times all the forces mustered by the United States." (Awkward phrasing of "three-four times")  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia's present pitiful condition is the result of her self-sacrificing services to humanity." (Awkward and slightly unclear phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph is incoherent and appears to be a jumbled sentence fragment, making it impossible to understand the intended meaning.  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the detailed historical account to the final incoherent paragraph is abrupt and confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "It is of to Russia was which the took to period from during unprepared Russia mobilize it fact forces a, six for months two weeks that armed action" lacks clarity and logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the analysis of Russia's role in the war to the final paragraph is disjointed and lacks a clear connection.
