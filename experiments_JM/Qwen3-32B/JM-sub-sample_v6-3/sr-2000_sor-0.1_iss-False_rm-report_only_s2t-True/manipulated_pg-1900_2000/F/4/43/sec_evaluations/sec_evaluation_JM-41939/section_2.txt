- [SYNTAX] "It was young Rosa Bonheur serving her apprenticeship to art." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "The students and copyists who regularly frequented the museum, not knowing her name, had christened her 'the little hussard.'" (no issue, but awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The hours which she did not consecrate to the Louvre, she spent in her father's studio..." (awkward word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty, this conscientiousness, without which the most gifted artist remains incomplete." (complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Whatever gifts he may be endowed with by nature, talent cannot be improvised..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Later on, when she in her turn became a teacher..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "This is how she came to acquire her clever talent for sculpture which would have sufficed to establish a reputation if she had not become the admirable painter that we know her to have been." (long and complex sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She understood them, she knew them, and loved them." (awkward repetition)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Rosa Bonheur's life and work without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Rosa's early training and her later success is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] The passage is dense with information, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from her training to her early exhibitions is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of her father's mania for changing residences is not clearly connected to the broader narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The description of her menagerie is somewhat disjointed from the main narrative thread.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from her animal studies to her first Salon submissions is not clearly explained.  
- [STRUCTURE] The passage lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next, especially in the middle section.  
- [CLARITY] The sentence about the terra-cotta and the approval of the critics is unclear in its connection to the rest of the paragraph.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about her continued work and dedication is not clearly linked to the earlier part of the text.
