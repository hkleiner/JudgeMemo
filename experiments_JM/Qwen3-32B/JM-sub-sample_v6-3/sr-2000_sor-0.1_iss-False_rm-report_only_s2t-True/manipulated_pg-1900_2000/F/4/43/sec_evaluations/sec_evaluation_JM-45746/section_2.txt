Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted" (awkward phrasing). - [SYNTAX] "He could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (awkward structure). - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of dashes and commas. - [LEXICON] "He said he didn't know, but he wanted the job that paid the most money." (repetition of "he" is acceptable but could be smoother). - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in focus from dress to preparation to application procedures.

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing dress to preparation and then to application procedures. - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the story about the young man seeking a promotion to the young woman's story. - [CLARITY] The connection between the stories of the young man and the young woman is unclear. - [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different topics (dress, preparation, application process) without clear transitions. - [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the young man and woman feels disconnected from the earlier discussion about teacher qualifications.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
