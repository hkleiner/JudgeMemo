Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "We however who have witnessed the succession of economic crises which attend and follow a great war ought not to forget..." (awkward phrasing and incorrect word order)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the light taxes were raised with an ease." (missing article and awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" (non-standard spelling; should be "wagon-loads")  
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories." (cumbersome and confusing sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the famous system of doles out of the rates, in augmentation of wages" (awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the war's impact on intellectual life to the condition of the working class is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the famine and the "doles out of the rates" is disjointed and lacks a clear progression of ideas.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the similar expedients of the last three years" is unclear without context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing over-population to discussing family size and social ambition is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about progress and Macaulay's examples is disconnected from the earlier discussion of famine and social conditions.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
