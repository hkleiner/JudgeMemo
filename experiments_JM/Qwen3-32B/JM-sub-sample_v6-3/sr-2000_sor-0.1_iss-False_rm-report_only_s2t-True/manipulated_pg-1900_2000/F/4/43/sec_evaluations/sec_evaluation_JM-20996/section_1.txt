2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the historical event in 1901 to a description of the Bishop Museum and then to surf-shooting, with no clear connection between these sections.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression, with disjointed transitions between the voyage, descriptions of Honolulu, and the museum.
- [CLARITY] The section about the International Date Line and "Revels of Neptune" is confusing and lacks clear explanation.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the voyage to the description of Manila Bay is abrupt and lacks context.
