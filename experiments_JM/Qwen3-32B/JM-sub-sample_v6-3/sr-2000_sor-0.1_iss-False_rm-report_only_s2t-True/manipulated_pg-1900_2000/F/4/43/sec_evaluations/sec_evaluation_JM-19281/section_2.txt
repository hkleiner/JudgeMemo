Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "On of in the, the hand cause have the peace one perceptions..." (fragmented and ungrammatical sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "to the the for effect also of of tend thenew 's role" (multiple grammatical errors and incoherent phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The phenomenon gather is of forces steadily the product historical that momentum." (incorrect word order and structure)  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling; not necessarily an error, but inconsistent with American English if that is the assumed standard)  
- [LEXICON] "thenew 's role" (unclear and likely incorrect word usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "On of in the, the hand cause have the peace one perceptions..." (incoherent and lacks logical connection to the rest of the paragraph)  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph beginning with "On the contrary" is abruptly followed by a sentence that is grammatically and logically incoherent, disrupting the flow.  
- [CLARITY] "to the the for effect also of of tend thenew 's role society." (meaning is unclear and the sentence lacks clarity)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the paragraph about spiritual search to the paragraph about environmentalism and feminism is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "The phenomenon gather is of forces steadily the product historical that momentum." is incoherent and does not logically follow the previous sentence.
