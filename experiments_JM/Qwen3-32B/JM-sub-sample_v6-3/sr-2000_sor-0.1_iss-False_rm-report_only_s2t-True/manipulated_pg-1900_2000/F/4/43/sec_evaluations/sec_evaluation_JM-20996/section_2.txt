Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "And it life well did if was 's, that, early city credence not the give weone its, to so is for history of he undisturbed quiet." (Severe grammatical errors and incoherent phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "he modeled it after the mediaeval towns of his European home." (Typo: "mediaeval" should be "medieval")
- [SPELLING] "leggins" (Incorrect spelling; should be "leggings")
- [GRAMMAR] "The strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth..." (Incorrect verb form; "pealing" should be "pealing" or "pealing" depending on intended meaning)
- [GRAMMAR] "There were Japanese, and East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all classes and conditions of Filipinos..." (Awkward phrasing and excessive use of "and")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Spaniard and Manila contains a jumbled, incoherent sentence that breaks the logical flow of the narrative.
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the description of clothing to the historical account of Manila is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
- [CLARITY] The sentence about the old wall saving the city is confusing and lacks clear subject-verb agreement.
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the historical account to the description of the bridge and the people is somewhat jarring and lacks smooth transition.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
