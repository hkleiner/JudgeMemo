- [LOGIC] The sentence "It must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of Millet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated if one is not acquainted with the country he painted" is grammatically correct but disrupts the flow of the text with its abrupt shift in focus.
