Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He inclined, just the., steps, in, was father to his walk Amenophis as of IV" (fragmented and grammatically incorrect sentence in preceding context)  
- [SYNTAX] "warlike however his little as son ancestors" (awkward and syntactically incorrect phrase in preceding context)  
- [SPELLING] "Amen-hetep" and "Akhen-Aten" (inconsistent spelling of names)  
- [SYNTAX] "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The official world promptly broke with the old religion" (vague and awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The king altered his throne-name, “Amen-hetep,” to “Akhen-Aten,” “The glory of the Sun’s Disk”; his young daughters received names compounded with “Aten,” whilst the courtiers found it advisable to strike out “Amen,” if this chanced to form part of their own names, and to substitute for it “Ra,” as having more or less the same significance as “Aten.”" (long and complex sentence with poor flow)  
- [SYNTAX] "The doctrine, as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt, that the officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it." (awkward and convoluted sentence structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Abimilki of Tyre apparently even tried to give himself out as one initiated into “the doctrine,” and to represent his city as a servant of Aten." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Neither the royal nor the national pride of Egypt would suffer any such familiarities." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The immediate removal of the Court from Thebes to Tell el Amarna points to a failure of the royal efforts, for the command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished." (confusing logic; the removal is presented as a failure, but the reasoning is unclear)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of religious reform, political implications, and administrative details without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The doctrine, as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt, that the officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it." (confusing and unclear explanation of the scope of the religious reform)  
- [LOGIC] "Abimilki of Tyre apparently even tried to give himself out as one initiated into “the doctrine,” and to represent his city as a servant of Aten." (sudden shift to a foreign official's actions without clear connection to the main narrative)  
- [LOGIC] "Neither the royal nor the national pride of Egypt would suffer any such familiarities." (vague and unclear reference to "familiarities")  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from the religious reform to the list of officials and their roles without clear connection or transition.  
- [LOGIC] "How far the Aten dogma represented real progress in religious thought can be gathered only from the contents of a few hymns remaining on the walls of some of the tombs." (sudden shift to evaluating the religious significance without clear transition)
