        • The meaning of the text is often unclear due to grammatical errors and poor phrasing.

        • "The king altered his throne-name, “Amen-hetep,” to “Akhen-Aten,” “The glory of the Sun’s Disk”; his young daughters received names compounded with “Aten,” whilst the courtiers found it advisable to strike out “Amen,” if this chanced to form part of their own names, and to substitute for it “Ra,” as having more or less the same significance as “Aten.”" (long and complex sentence with poor flow)
        • "The doctrine, as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt, that the officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it."

        • "How far the Aten dogma represented real progress in religious thought can be gathered only from the contents of a few hymns remaining on the walls of some of the tombs." (sudden shift to evaluating the religious significance without clear transition)
    - [STRUCTURE]:

    - [CLARITY]:
        • "The doctrine, as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt, that the officials of Syria and Palestine—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it."
