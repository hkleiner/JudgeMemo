Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It men urged to be will scientific the viewscope widened 's that of Spencer explanation." (Grammatical structure is incoherent and ungrammatical.)  
- [SYNTAX] "Was as that to main contribution he not regarded his it this himself philosophy?" (Sentence structure is jumbled and ungrammatical.)  
- [SPELLING] "viewscope" (Likely a misspelling of "view scope" or "vision scope.")  
- [SYNTAX] "Did he not himself provide a summary, setting forth the sixteen articles of the Spencerian creed..." (Awkward phrasing and unclear syntax.)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He proclaimed 'the gradual growth of all things by natural processes out of natural antecedents'." (Grammatically correct but awkwardly phrased.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It men urged to be will scientific the viewscope widened 's that of Spencer explanation." (Sentence lacks logical connection to the rest of the paragraph.)  
- [STRUCTURE] "Was as that to main contribution he not regarded his it this himself philosophy?" (Sentence is disjointed and does not contribute to the logical flow.)  
- [CLARITY] "It is true that the affairs of the mind give pause and seem to present something of a difficulty." (Vague and unclear reference to "affairs of the mind.")  
- [TRANSITION] "But even here 'specifically stated, the problem is to interpret mental evolution in terms of the redistribution of matter and motion'." (Abrupt transition without clear connection to the previous idea.)  
- [LOGIC] "Are we not again and again bidden, now in forecast, now in retrospect, to look below the surface..." (Overly complex and confusing phrasing that hinders logical progression.)
