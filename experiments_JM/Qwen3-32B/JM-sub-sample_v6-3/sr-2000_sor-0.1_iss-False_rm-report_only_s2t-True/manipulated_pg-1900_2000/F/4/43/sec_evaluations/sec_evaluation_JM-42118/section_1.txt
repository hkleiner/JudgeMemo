(run-on sentence with severe syntax errors)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In as sombre a narrow street as there is in all her dark alleys, on the fifth day of April in the much bewigged and powdered year of 1732..." (awkward phrasing and word order)  
- [LEXICON] "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse" (unusual and confusing word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "the glory of it bathed the lad's eyes and heart for sixteen years, so that his hands got them itching to create the splendour of it which sang within him" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "the nations, weary of war, agreed to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. In this, our artist's sixteenth year, the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years." (awkward transition and phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "She mothered every industry." (unusual and ambiguous phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between the biography of Fragonard and historical events without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the birth of Fragonard to political events in France without clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] The text is often unclear in its intent, especially in the first paragraph, which is fragmented and difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the early life of Fragonard to the political and cultural context of France is abrupt and lacks logical flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Pompadour is long and dense, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas.
