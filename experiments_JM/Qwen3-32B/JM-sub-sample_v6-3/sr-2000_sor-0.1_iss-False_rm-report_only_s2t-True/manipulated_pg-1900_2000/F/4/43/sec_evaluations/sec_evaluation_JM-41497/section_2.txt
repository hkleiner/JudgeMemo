- [SPELLING] "pettish condemnation" (likely a typo or awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Of course the faults of a man and the merits of his work are distinct and stand apart from one another, but we are too apt to look at Reynolds the man in the light of Goldsmith's epitaph, and it is the failing of popular biography to supply popular people with a measure of moral equipment that would make a saint self-conscious."

- [CLARITY] The sentence "Reynolds thought the consorted friendship of Burke great, in, have, many men, this enjoyed atmosphere intimate he of Garrick the mark and extraordinary must receptivity also world, Gibbon mind to made who his him served some of other and with in Goldsmith the advantage." is incoherent and lacks clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Reynolds' personal life to the broader commentary on biography is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence "It to is see they more great as men interesting far lived." is incoherent and does not logically follow the previous content.
