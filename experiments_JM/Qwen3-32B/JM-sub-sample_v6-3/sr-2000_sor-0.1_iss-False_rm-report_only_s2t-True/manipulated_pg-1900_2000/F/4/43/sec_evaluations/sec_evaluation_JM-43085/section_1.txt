- [GRAMMAR] "Such is not destined to be the rôle of Meissonier!"
- [GRAMMAR] "It is true that, by way of ransom, he spent much time in painting vast canvases that today hold but a small place in his life work."
- [GRAMMAR] "The press, the art clubs, not to mention the salons, were all more or less divided between the romantics and the classicists, the innovators and the traditionalists, and fanned the flames of a quarrel which, in view of the worth of the two leaders--one of whom spelled genius and the other perfection--was destined to appear without sanction to the eyes of posterity."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] The text contains a completely incoherent sentence: "battle a really, he with because, not what did he, that decided painted he was certain loftiness none know a!"
- [LOGIC] The sentence "His so so a immense a neither, nor struggle tragic was triumph." is completely incoherent and lacks logical structure.
- [LOGIC] The sentence "Such is not destined to be the rôle of Meissonier!" is abrupt and lacks context.
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions, particularly between the introduction and the early years chapter.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about the father entering Ernest as a druggist's apprentice feels disconnected from the preceding discussion about artistic movements.
