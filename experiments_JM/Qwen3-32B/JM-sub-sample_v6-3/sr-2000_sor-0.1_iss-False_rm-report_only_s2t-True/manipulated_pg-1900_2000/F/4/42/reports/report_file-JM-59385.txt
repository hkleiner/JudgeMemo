        • "as though her touch breathed life into them" should be "as though her touch breathed life into it" (referring to a single jewel)

        • The reference to "mission school" and "graduation day" is unclear in context and lacks sufficient setup
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from the jewelry shop to the memory of the mission school is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative link
