Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had christen her" should be "had christened her"  
- [GRAMMAR] "only drive her" should be "only drove her"  
- [GRAMMAR] "after years of devoted toil" should be "after years of devoted toil" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "sincerity and the vigour of her talent made an impression upon the critics" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is an occasion of great rejoicing both for Rosa Bonheur and for her father" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Rosa's artistic development to her living arrangements and then to her animal studies, with minimal transitional phrases  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about her father's mania for changing residences is somewhat disconnected from the main narrative about Rosa's artistic growth  
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Every morning, the young artist made the rounds of slaughter-houses, markets, the Museum, anywhere and everywhere that she might see and study animals" is repetitive and could be more concise  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from her early studies to her first Salon submissions is abrupt and lacks a smooth progression  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about her menagerie is somewhat out of place and disrupts the flow of the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
