2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the Dimmock Line to the Battle of Petersburg without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different topics (transportation, fortifications, battle) without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] "The very length and size of the fortifications proved to be a disadvantage" is vague and lacks explanation  
- [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about the Battle of Petersburg begins abruptly without clear connection to the previous content
