- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator's work at the print shop to a scene involving a "faker" selling soap with no clear connection to the main narrative  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the soap seller and the "old army game" is unclear and seems disconnected from the main story  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the narrator's work progression to the scene with Mr. Newett and the soap seller is abrupt and confusing
