        • "has am the bankruptcy" (likely a typo for "has as the bankruptcy")
        • "woulded ensure" (incorrect verb form)
        • "attain" (should be "attained" to match past tense)

    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The paragraph on "scientific materialism" is dense and could benefit from clearer segmentation
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "The goal held up as justification of such abuses was the creation of a new kind of society that woulded ensure not only freedom from want but fulfilment for the human spirit." (confusing due to grammatical errors and complex phrasing)
    - [TRANSITION]:
