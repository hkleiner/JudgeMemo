Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "has am the bankruptcy" (likely a typo for "has as the bankruptcy")  
- [GRAMMAR] "woulded ensure" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "attain" (should be "attained" to match past tense)  
- [SPELLING] "fulfilment" (British spelling; acceptable but inconsistent with "fulfilled" in other parts of the text)  
- [SYNTAX] "The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather momentum." (awkward phrasing, could be smoother)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the reawakened interest in religion to the "bankruptcy of the materialist enterprise" without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on "scientific materialism" is dense and could benefit from clearer segmentation  
- [CLARITY] "The goal held up as justification of such abuses was the creation of a new kind of society that woulded ensure not only freedom from want but fulfilment for the human spirit." (confusing due to grammatical errors and complex phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] The reference to Bahá'u'lláh's warning is abrupt and lacks contextual linkage to the preceding discussion  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence "The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development has left no doubt." is vague and lacks a clear conclusion or elaboration  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
