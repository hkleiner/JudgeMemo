Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "caedn’t" (likely a typo for "couldn’t")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he take off" (should be "he took off")  
- [GRAMMAR] "enrich our arts" (missing "ed" for past tense; should be "enriched our arts")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he smash more false fronts" (should be "he smashed more false fronts")  
- [GRAMMAR] "he and the many who followed him were well advanced in the lively morning of a day that isn’t over yet" (awkward phrasing, but not a major fluency issue)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions, making the chronology of Bradley’s life and career somewhat confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Bradley’s early life and his later artistic achievements is implied but not clearly explained, which could leave the reader with gaps in understanding.  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or overly poetic (e.g., "the lively morning of a day that isn’t over yet"), which may obscure the intended meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the introduction to the biographical chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative bridge.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
