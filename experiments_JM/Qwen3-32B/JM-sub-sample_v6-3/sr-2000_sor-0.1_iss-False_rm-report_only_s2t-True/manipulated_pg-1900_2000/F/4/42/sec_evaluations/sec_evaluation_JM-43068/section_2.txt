Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "as his whole thoughts were directed to suppressed any tendencies" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "he was no longer a great artist" (tense inconsistency with previous paragraph)  
- [GRAMMAR] "how much corn can be raise each year" (incorrect verb form; should be "raised")  
- [SPELLING] "m√©nage" (correct spelling, but may be unfamiliar to some readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "the very shape of the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ materially in various districts" (awkward phrasing in previous section, but not in current section)  
- [LEXICON] "he could impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the mirror-like surface of the water" (somewhat verbose phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Another dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he throws off his sadly philosophic mood, he was no longer a great artist" (tense inconsistency and abrupt shift in tone)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the analysis of "La Baigneuse" to the broader philosophical interpretation of Millet is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "He is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him" (metaphorical language may be confusing without context)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing Millet's philosophy to his depiction of the shepherd in "The Sheep Pen" is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] "He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of the sunset, of which he is so often a witness" (contradictory phrasing; he is a witness but feels nothing)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
