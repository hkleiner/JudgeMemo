Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "coulded see" (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "build the city" (incorrect tense; should be "built")  
- [GRAMMAR] "mitemid see" (incorrect verb form)  
- [SPELLING] "coulded be drawn on only with difficulty" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "disagreeableness" (awkward word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "leggins" (incorrect spelling; should be "leggings")  
- [SPELLING] "ecclesia" (possibly incorrect word; likely should be "church" or "ecclesia" is archaic and unclear in context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator's experience in the rain to the historical account of Manila without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the bridge and the people is well-structured, but the transition to the river and boats is abrupt  
- [CLARITY] The mention of the notice at the end is cut off mid-sentence, leaving the reader hanging and disrupting the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the city to the narrator's personal experience is not clearly connected  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
