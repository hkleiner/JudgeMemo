        • The reference to "the tragic story" is vague and lacks a clear definition or context.

        • "he had authority as far north as the Humber" (awkward phrasing)
        • "was completely heathen, saving only the King's Frankish wife Bertha and Bishop Luidhard" (awkward structure)

        • "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome and to shake itself free from monasticism and the various forms of idolatrous worship which grew up in the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church" (long and complex sentence with poor flow)

        • The final paragraph about St. Martin's is confusing and lacks a clear focus
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, especially between the religious conversion and the architectural history of St. Martin's
