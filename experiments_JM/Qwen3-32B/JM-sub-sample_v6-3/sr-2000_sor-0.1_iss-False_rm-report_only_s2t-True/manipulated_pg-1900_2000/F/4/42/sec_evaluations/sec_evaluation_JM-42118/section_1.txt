2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of Grasse to political gossip and back to the boy's life without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts between the boy's life and the political events in France without clear connection or purpose.  
- [LOGIC] The section on the Pompadour and her influence is detailed but feels disconnected from the main narrative about Fragonard.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the chapter on "The Beginnings" to "Rome" is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The text references historical events and figures without sufficient context for a general reader.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative is overly descriptive and meandering, making it difficult to follow the central story of Fragonard's early life.
