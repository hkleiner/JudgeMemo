Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The vital statistics was those of Russia..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "well-know" should be "well-known"  
- [GRAMMAR] "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." (awkward phrasing and inconsistent tense usage)  
- [LEXICON] "The light taxes were raised with an ease." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing overpopulation and famine to "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions..." without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph on "The astonishing progress..." feels disconnected from the preceding discussion on overpopulation and famine  
- [CLARITY] "The only error with which the economists of this time may be charged..." is somewhat ambiguous in its reference  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing economic conditions to "Families are restricted..." without clear linkage  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
