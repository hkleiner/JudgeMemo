1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened, and quickly leaped over the wall." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was carefully holding his muffler, which is wriggling about in the most extraordinary manner." (tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The poor, wee bairn whined, and was so glad when I picked him up, I could not left him there alone, could I?" (tense inconsistency and incorrect verb form "left")  
- [GRAMMAR] "But if no one claims him I can keep him, can't I?" pleaded Don, who have grown dismal at the thought that he might be deprived of his new pet. (tense inconsistency "have grown")  
- [GRAMMAR] "They was, indeed, and they make many different kinds, and they are all good." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "scones, which, if you know anything at all about Scotland, you must have heard of, for they are one of their best-liked dishes; and until you have eat a scone..." (incorrect past tense "eat" should be "eaten")  
- [SPELLING] "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened, and quickly leaped over the wall." (missing comma after "happened")  
- [SPELLING] "He found Donald carefully holding his muffler, which is wriggling about in the most extraordinary manner." (missing comma after "muffler")  
- [SPELLING] "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened, and quickly leaped over the wall." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly from the story of Donald and the puppy to a description of Scottish afternoon tea, with no clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the tea and Scottish food feels disconnected from the main narrative about the puppy and the Gordon family.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Uncle Alan" and "Marjorie's birthday-party" lacks sufficient context for a reader unfamiliar with the broader story.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the story of the puppy to the description of the tea is jarring and lacks a logical connection.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the Clans" and "meeting of the Clans" is vague and lacks explanation for a general reader.
