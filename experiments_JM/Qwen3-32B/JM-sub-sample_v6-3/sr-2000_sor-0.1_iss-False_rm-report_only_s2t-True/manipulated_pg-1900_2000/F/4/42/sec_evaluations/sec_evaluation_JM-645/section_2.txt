- [GRAMMAR] "had been upstairs to changed something" (incorrect verb form "changed" instead of "change")

- [SPELLING] "Itsed a charming article" (misspelled "Itsed" instead of "It's said")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I was happy to be able to did the same" (incorrect verb form "did" instead of "do")  
- [GRAMMAR] "You’red so deep" (misspelled "You’red" instead of "You're")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from Lady Jane's reaction to Vereker's response at dinner without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the man in the paper" and "the article" without clear identification  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences are overly long and complex, making the narrative flow less smooth  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the dinner scene to Vereker's dialogue without sufficient context  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Lady Jane's actions and Vereker's reaction is not clearly explained
