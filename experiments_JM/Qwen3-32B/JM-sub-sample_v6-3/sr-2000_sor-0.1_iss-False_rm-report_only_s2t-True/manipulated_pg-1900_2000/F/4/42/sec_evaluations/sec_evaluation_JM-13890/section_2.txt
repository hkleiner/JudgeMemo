1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "was completely heathen, saving only the King's Frankish wife Bertha and Bishop Luidhard" (awkward structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "when the marriage with the heathen Ethelbert had taken place" (redundant phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "while expressed himself as content with the gods of his forefathers" (missing subject-verb agreement)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Bishop Luidhard, whose name should always be linked with that of St. Augustine, appears to have died soon after the arrival of Pope Gregory's mission" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome and to shake itself free from monasticism and the various forms of idolatrous worship which grew up in the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church" (long and complex sentence with poor flow)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the organization of the churches holding to the Elizabethan form of worship will no doubt continue to be centred and focussed at Canterbury" (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ethelbert's authority to the religious state of the Saxon capital in 597  
- [LOGIC] Jump from Ethelbert's speech to the role of Queen Bertha and her chaplain without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the conversion of Ethelbert to the historical status of St. Martin's church  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas between the Christianization of England and the future of the Church in England  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between historical events and archaeological debates without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] The sentence about Ethelbert's speech is confusing due to missing subject-verb agreement and unclear structure  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, especially between the religious conversion and the architectural history of St. Martin's  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about St. Martin's is confusing and lacks a clear focus
