Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "could was seen further from the fact"  
- [GRAMMAR] "the role played by Russia and the services the Russian Armies rendered in the struggle against Prussian Imperialism could was seen further"  
- [GRAMMAR] "losses sustain by any of the other Allies"  
- [SPELLING] "belligerents" is misspelled as "belligerents" (correct, but "belligerents" is repeated unnecessarily)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Russia's role must be gauged, first of all, by the efforts made by the Russian Army to blast the German war plans during the first years of the War"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from Russia's role in the war to the question of whether Germany could have won, without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of the same points about Russia's role in different sections without clear progression  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in "the final catastrophe of the Central Powers was the direct consequence of the offensive of the Allies in 1918, but Russia made possible this collapse to a considerable degree"  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the introduction and the main body of the chapter  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
