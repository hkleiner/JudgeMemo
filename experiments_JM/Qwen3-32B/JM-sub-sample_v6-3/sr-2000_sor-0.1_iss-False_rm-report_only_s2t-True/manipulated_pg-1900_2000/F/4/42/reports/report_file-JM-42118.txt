  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "the sunburnt feet in the blue waters" (should be "bathes her sunburnt feet in the blue waters")
        • "the high promenades of Grasse--as the worthy mercer was first in all the little town to know by his modest traffic in them" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
        • "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
        • "the small boy with the big head was born in the year after François Boucher came back to Paris from his Italian wanderings on the eve of his thirties and won to academic honour" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
        • "the very soldiery singing mocking songs; when--Louis strutting it as conqueror with the army, got the small-pox at Metz" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
        • "raising the youngest of the daughters of the historic and noble house of De Nesle to was his accepted consort under the rank and honours of Duchess of Chateauroux" (grammatical error)
        • "the king raised Madame Lenormant d'Etioles, a daughter of the rich financier class, to be Marquise de Pompadour, and yield up to her the sceptre over his people" (awkward phrasing and grammatical error)
        • "the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years. From this time, the peace being signed, Louis the Fifteenth laid aside all effort to fulfil the duties of the lord over a great people" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)
        • "She is possessed of a rare combination of talents and accomplishments, and of astounding taste" (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)

        • "the French middle-class ideal of respectability meant no heaven for this youth's goal, no ultimate aim for his ambition" (awkward phrasing)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The text jumps abruptly from descriptions of Grasse to political gossip and back to the boy's life without clear transitions.
        • The narrative shifts between the boy's life and the political events in France without clear connection or purpose.
        • The section on the Pompadour and her influence is detailed but feels disconnected from the main narrative about Fragonard.
        • The transition from the chapter on "The Beginnings" to "Rome" is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.
        • The text references historical events and figures without sufficient context for a general reader.
        • The narrative is overly descriptive and meandering, making it difficult to follow the central story of Fragonard's early life.
