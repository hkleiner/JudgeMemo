Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "is roused to more aggressive measures by the resistance of the powerful priests of Amon in Thebes." (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The king alter his throne-name" (missing verb tense)  
- [SPELLING] "Ai, called Haya in the Amarna letters, was probably a secretary of state, and was once sent as a special ambassador to Babylonia." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The official world promptly broke with the old religion." (vague and awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The doctrine, as the new dogmas were called in inscriptions at Tell el Amarna, was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics in Egypt..." (repetition and wordiness)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the religious reform to the naming of officials and their roles without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between the religious context, political implications, and administrative details without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place is still altogether unfinished." (confusing reference to past and present)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between the religious reform and the list of officials who adopted the new doctrine  
- [LOGIC] The mention of foreign officials and their responses to the reform is abrupt and not well integrated into the main narrative
