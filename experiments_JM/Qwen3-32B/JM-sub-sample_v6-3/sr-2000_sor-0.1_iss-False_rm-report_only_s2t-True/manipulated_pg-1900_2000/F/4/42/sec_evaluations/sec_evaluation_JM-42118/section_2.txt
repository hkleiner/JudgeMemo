Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils" (awkward phrasing and unclear pronoun reference)
- [SYNTAX] "the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' to guide him; the weavers working from the enlargement" (fragmented sentence structure)
- [SPELLING] "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils" (repetition of "enlargement")
- [GRAMMAR] "the artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry" (awkward phrasing and unclear explanation)
- [GRAMMAR] "the State demanding, however, that the artist should work over it sufficiently to signed his name upon it" (incorrect verb form "to signed")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's artistic development to the political context of "quarrels between priests and parliaments" with no clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narrative threads (Fragonard's training, Boucher's career, political events) without clear transitions
- [CLARITY] The explanation of the tapestry-making process is confusing and lacks clear progression
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Fragonard's artistic training to the political assassination of the king is abrupt and lacks context
- [LOGIC] The text mentions "Damiens stabbed the king with a penknife slightly under the fifth rib of his left side" without explaining the significance or context of this event

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
