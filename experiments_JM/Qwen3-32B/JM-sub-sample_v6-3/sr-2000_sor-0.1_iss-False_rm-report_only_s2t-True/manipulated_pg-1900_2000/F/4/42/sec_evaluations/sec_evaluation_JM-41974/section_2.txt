Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "If he wish to paint a Last Supper, it mattered little to him..." (incorrect verb form)
- [GRAMMAR] "History and tradition did not counted with him." (incorrect verb form)
- [GRAMMAR] "whatever it would be, unless around a sumptuous table..." (awkward phrasing)
- [SPELLING] "Caliari" is inconsistently used as both "Caliari" and "Veronese" (though this is contextually appropriate, it may cause momentary confusion)
- [SYNTAX] "He ran the danger of acquiring mannerisms and becoming an imitator." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Veronese's early work in Venice to his personality traits at the end without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from one historical anecdote to another without clear signposting or logical connections between paragraphs
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of Veronese's artistic style to his personal life at the end is abrupt
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about Veronese's private life feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about his artistic development

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
