Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Hebrew is one example among many of a language outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech" (awkward phrasing and grammatical structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The language in which it is framed continues fixed, amid the slowly developing conditions of the workaday world" (missing article and awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "often not fully understand" (missing "understood")  
- [GRAMMAR] "you will found the service conducted in a language" (incorrect verb form; should be "find")  
- [GRAMMAR] "has been learn by them only for the purposes of the liturgy" (incorrect verb form; should be "learned")  
- [GRAMMAR] "To render this possible the work of scholars such as Arthur Davis has contributed" (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Part of the profits that accrued from the publication of 'The Services of the Synagogue' has been devoted" (subject-verb agreement issue; "has" should be "have")  
- [GRAMMAR] "is to was delivered to-day by the most distinguished of lived Jewish men of letters" (incorrect verb form; should be "is to be delivered" and "lived" should be "living")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Arthur Davis to the broader topic of Hebrew as a ritual language without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical examples of ritual languages and the specific case of Hebrew without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of "roses of Jericho" is introduced without sufficient explanation, making it confusing for readers unfamiliar with the reference  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the revival of Hebrew to the claim that it is the only ritual language to have done so is abrupt and lacks sufficient support  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing Arthur Davis's character to the claim that the Jews are a "Chosen People" in the next chapter is abrupt and lacks a clear connection
