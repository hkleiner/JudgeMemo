Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The subject of the book does not entered into the matter" (incorrect verb form)
- [GRAMMAR] "He woulded like to have Massonâ€™s Life too in 6 vols." (incorrect past tense)
- [SPELLING] "He woulded" (incorrect spelling of "would")
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "According to the weightiest of French critics of our time the author...")
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "But . . . de gustibus . . . !" (ellipses usage is unconventional)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Mark Rutherford to Augustine Birrell and George Borrow without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between multiple literary examples (Mark Rutherford, Homer, Virgil, etc.) without clear organization
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing literary criticism to describing books as "houses" and "Cathedrals"
- [CLARITY] The metaphor of books as "humble craft" and "stately merchantman" is somewhat confusing in context
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Milton and Masson's Life feels disconnected from the broader argument

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
