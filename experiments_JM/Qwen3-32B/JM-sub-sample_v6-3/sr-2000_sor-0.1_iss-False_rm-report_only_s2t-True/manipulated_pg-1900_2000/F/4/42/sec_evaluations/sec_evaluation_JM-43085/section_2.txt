Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he have begotten an artist" (context reference, but repeated in current section as "he had to achieve a living" is correct)  
- [GRAMMAR] "it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master is engaged upon his ceiling painting..." (tense inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It must have seemed to him, later on, that he himself had witnessed its close." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In this picture one may find, I will not said in miniature..." (incorrect verb form)  
- [GRAMMAR] "all his paintings am destined to be contained in narrow limits" (subject-verb agreement error)
