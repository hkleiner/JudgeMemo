    - [LOGIC]:

        • The transition from Ramsey's conversation with the Security Officer to his personal financial situation is abrupt
        • The introduction of Sally Englander calling from the kitchen is jarring and seems to jump to a different scene without clear transition
        • The shift from Ramsey and Englander's conversation to Sally's question is abrupt and lacks context
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The meaning of "planetarized the Transfer Service" is not immediately clear
