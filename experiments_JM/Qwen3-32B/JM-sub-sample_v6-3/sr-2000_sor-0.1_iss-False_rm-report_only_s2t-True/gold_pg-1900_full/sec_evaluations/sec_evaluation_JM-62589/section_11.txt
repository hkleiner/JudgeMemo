Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was your own cousin, child, and you took his life!" (awkward phrasing and unclear antecedent for "you")  
- [SYNTAX] "The arms were no longer empty. Hungry, starving Debby rushed to fill her mother’s place!" (sudden shift in sentence structure disrupts flow)  
- [LEXICON] "rascal Jack Martin, and he found there a welcome so loving and true that he disappointed all those who expected only evil of him and became gentleman Jack, and a good foster son..." (repetition of "he" and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "And by and by, when Deborah’s face and form had rounded into perfect maidenly beauty, and the rich brown hair had grown to comely length and waviness, came Doctor Bell to tell his love and doubts." (overuse of commas disrupts readability)  
- [SPELLING] "troublous" (archaic or incorrect spelling in modern context)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Debby’s emotional conflict to the introduction of Jack Martin with no clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps from Debby’s reconciliation with her mother to the arrival of Jack Martin and then to her relationship with Doctor Bell, with little connection between these events  
- [CLARITY] The identity and role of Jack Martin are introduced abruptly and are not clearly explained in the context of the story  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Debby’s emotional state to the arrival of Doctor Bell is abrupt and lacks narrative cohesion  
- [LOGIC] The resolution of Debby’s character arc is somewhat rushed, with little development of her internal conflict or how she reconciles her past with her new life  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
