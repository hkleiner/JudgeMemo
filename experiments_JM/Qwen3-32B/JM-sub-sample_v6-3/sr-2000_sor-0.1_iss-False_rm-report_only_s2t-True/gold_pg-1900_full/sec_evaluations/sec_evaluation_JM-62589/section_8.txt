Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "But,—even while many were frozen—and all endured untold agony..." (misplaced punctuation and awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He could not recross the river. His proud spirit quailed at the thought of retreat, but to engage in another battle just then might mean ruin." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [LEXICON] "Their splendid courage strengthened by their late victory bore them up during the after days of suffering..." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "But"—he was still speaking, though the shouts had drowned, for the moment, his voice, "there is one thing more to do..." (misuse of em dash and quotation marks)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He could not recross the river. His proud spirit quailed at the thought of retreat, but to engage in another battle just then might mean ruin." (sudden shift in logic without clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between multiple events and characters without clear transitions (e.g., from the battle to the council of war to Robert's personal thoughts)  
- [CLARITY] "He saw a still form beside a lonely road, he heard the last words of the dying man..." (unclear reference to the "dying man" and the "still form")  
- [TRANSITION] "And during those long solemn hours a handful of men kept alive the fires in the deserted camp..." (abrupt transition from the council of war to the aftermath)  
- [LOGIC] "He might never find the boy for whom he had searched since he left New England, never know the story!" (unclear reference to "the boy" and "the story")
