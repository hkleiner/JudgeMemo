1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He pressed his hand against the pistol in his pocket, it was safe" (comma splice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would have given anything in his power to have solved the mystery..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was young, and with all the misery life was sweet" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would not touch the damp coat or think any more than was possible, of the wound" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He knew death when he saw it now, and in gentle patience he smoothed the curly hair..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He could remember naught else" (archaic phrasing, though stylistically appropriate)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He stayed behind to beat the drum, didnâ€™t he?" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the confrontation between Shirtliffe and Morley to Shirtliffe's internal thoughts and then to Morley's death, with little transition  
- [LOGIC] The resolution of the conflict between Shirtliffe and Morley is abrupt and lacks sufficient emotional or narrative buildup  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the battle scene to the discovery of Shirtliffe by his comrades is somewhat jarring  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Debby Mason" and the messages to be delivered is somewhat confusing without more context  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Shirtliffe's actions, his internal thoughts, and the external events without clear transitions
