Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he must find Mason; until he had done that nothing mattered." (awkward semicolon usage)  
- [SPELLING] "Floating rumors came now and then to the effect that General Washington was on his way..." (missing comma after "effect")  
- [SYNTAX] "he was stronger than many, more able to undertake a difficult or dangerous task, he then, must exert himself..." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [LEXICON] "he then, must exert himself..." (redundant "then" and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Robert turned from the group, one thought filling his mind; he must find Mason; until he had done that nothing mattered." (overuse of semicolons)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "‘You were long enough in coming, lad,’ he said, ‘I’m nearly frozen. What you doing in those togs?’ he questioned..." (inconsistent quotation punctuation)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "‘Don’t you—don’t you know me?’ the boy asked in a broken voice." (awkward em dash usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Mason’s heroic past to his current state of drunkenness with little explanation  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Robert’s mission, Mason’s condition, and the confrontation with the British officer without clear transitions  
- [CLARITY] The identity of "Captain Morley" is confusing and not clearly resolved  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Mason’s drunken state to the sudden recognition of Robert is abrupt and lacks context  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of a British officer who resembles Robert is not clearly explained or foreshadowed  
- [CLARITY] The relationship between Robert and Mason is not clearly established, making the emotional impact less effective
