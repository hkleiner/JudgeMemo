- [GRAMMAR] "He was a young man, full of ambition and was to return in a week to Philadelphia" (awkward phrasing and inconsistent verb tenses)  
- [SYNTAX] "As he went about his duties, Shirtliffe’s white face haunted him" (confusing subject-verb agreement and phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "A nurse in passing saw him pause, and stopped to say, “Bob’s gone, Doctor Bell.”"  
- [LEXICON] "Fair it was, but not with death’s pallor" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in dialogue tags, e.g., "“Nurse,” he said sharply, “help me bear this—boy—to my tent, I’m going to save—him!”"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the surgeon’s actions to the boy’s recovery without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time points and perspectives without clear markers  
- [CLARITY] The identity of "Debby Mason" is not clearly established until later, causing confusion  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the battlefield to the hospital and then to the emotional resolution  
- [LOGIC] The sudden decision by the surgeon to give up his furlough and care for the boy is not clearly motivated
