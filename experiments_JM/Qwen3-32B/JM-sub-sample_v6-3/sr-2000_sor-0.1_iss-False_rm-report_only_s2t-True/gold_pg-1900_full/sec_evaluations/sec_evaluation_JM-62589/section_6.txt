Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had had neither chance or inclination to change" (incorrect use of "or" instead of "nor")  
- [GRAMMAR] "his words seem to flow unconsciously" (subject-verb agreement issue; "seem" should be "seemed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was none too soon. The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe, with bowed head dashed on, Morley on his return beat, came up to the group" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was trying to capture him"—Shirtliffe’s thoughts had never been clearer, and his words seem to flow unconsciously—" (incomplete sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had promised to wait until his return, under the circumstances he must try and get away" (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had fainted once that day, God keep him from another attack!" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s coming!" he shouted sitting upright in the saddle (missing comma after "he shouted")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The real Morley might return at any minute, Robert did not know he had come and gone" (confusing reference to Robert and Morley; unclear relationship)  
- [LOGIC] "That would mean sure death, and in Robert’s breast lay a secret which would give life and hope to the suffering army of men in General Lee’s command" (sudden shift in focus from Robert's danger to the army's hope)  
- [LOGIC] "He had fainted once that day, God keep him from another attack!" (sudden shift in tone and logic without clear connection)  
- [LOGIC] "He had never known such exhaustion before. A laugh startled him, and he was even more startled to realize that it was his own laugh" (sudden shift in narrative tone and logic)  
- [LOGIC] "He was too weary to open his eyes or to care what became of him, but suddenly a voice from among the others first startled, then stilled his breath" (sudden shift in narrative flow)  
- [LOGIC] "He’s dead, Jack, dead! He was shot by a Britisher who looks so like me, that I have got to find him" (confusing reference to "the other boy" without clear context)  
- [LOGIC] "The men listened until the truth broke upon them. The rumor was indeed true, the siege was over, the new general had come in time to save them!" (sudden shift in narrative without clear connection to previous events)
