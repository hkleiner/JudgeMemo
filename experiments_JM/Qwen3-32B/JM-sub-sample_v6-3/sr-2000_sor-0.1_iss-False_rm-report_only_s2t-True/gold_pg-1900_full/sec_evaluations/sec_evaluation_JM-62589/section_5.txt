Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He is dying! Leave us alone, he comes from my town, I have something to say to him." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Tell her that her father died—like—a—soldier." (overuse of em dashes disrupts flow)  
- [SYNTAX] "I tried for—her sake—but I failed." (awkward use of em dashes and fragmented structure)  
- [SPELLING] "Shirtliffe almost dropped the heavy head upon his arm." (no issue, but awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "Kiss me! Kiss me!" (repetition for effect, but could be considered stylistic rather than fluent)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He is dying! Leave us alone, he comes from my town, I have something to say to him." (sudden shift in tone and unclear reasoning)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the fight to Mason's death and Robert's emotional response is abrupt.  
- [CLARITY] "He was back in the old life with his neglected little girl." (unclear reference to "old life")  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dying man's speech to the evening setting is jarring.  
- [LOGIC] "The listeners could take no chances, however. 'Speak or I’ll fire!'" (sudden escalation in tension without clear cause)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
