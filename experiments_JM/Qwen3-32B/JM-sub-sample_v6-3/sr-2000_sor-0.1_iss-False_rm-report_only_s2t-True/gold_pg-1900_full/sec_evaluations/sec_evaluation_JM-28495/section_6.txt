Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "He is going to visit friends in the north. Aren't you, darling?" (inconsistent pronoun reference) - [PUNCTUATION] "Eileen's brother-in-law--he was Excalibur's master no longer..." (dashes used inconsistently) - [SPELLING] "gaunt man on the sofa" (missing article "the") - [SYNTAX] "He was sent instead to a great manufacturing town in the north..." (awkward phrasing) - [LEXICON] "He grew thin and lathy;" (uncommon word "lathy" may be confusing)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Eileen and Excalibur's plans to the curate's train accident - [STRUCTURE] Jump from London meeting to train accident without transition - [CLARITY] Confusing timeline between Eileen's visit to London and the curate's train journey - [TRANSITION] Abrupt ending with train accident after detailed London visit description - [CONSISTENCY] Unclear connection between Excalibur's actions and "instrument of Destiny" statement
