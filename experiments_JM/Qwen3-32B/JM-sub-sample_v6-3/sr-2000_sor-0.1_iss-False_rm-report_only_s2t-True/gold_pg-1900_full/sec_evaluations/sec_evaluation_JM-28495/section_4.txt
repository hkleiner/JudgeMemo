2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Excalibur's daily walk to the curate's breakfast scene without clear transition. - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed narrative flow between Excalibur's behavior and the introduction of the curate. - [CLARITY] Confusing cause-effect relationship in the curate's explanation of his late breakfast. - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the dramatic entrance of Excalibur to the dialogue between Eileen and the curate.
