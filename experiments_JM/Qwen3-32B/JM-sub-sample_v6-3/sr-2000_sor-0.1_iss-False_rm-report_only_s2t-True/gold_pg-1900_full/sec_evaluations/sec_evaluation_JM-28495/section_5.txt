1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the blast of the newest and most vulgar motor horn, to be precise,--" (misplaced comma and em dash)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "owing to a terrifying noise behind it,--the blast..." (confusing punctuation usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "It emitted long, snaky spirals of some elastic substance, which clogged his teeth and tickled his throat and wound themselves round his tongue and nearly choked him." (cumbersome and run-on sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "Excalibur was the gentlest of creatures, but the most perfect gentleman has his dignity to consider." (awkward phrasing and mismatched subject-verb agreement)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "They looked not so much at Excalibur as through him." (awkward phrasing and unclear punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Excalibur's experiences to the curate and Eileen's conversation without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly moves from Excalibur's perspective to the curate and Eileen's emotional discussion, creating a disjointed flow  
- [CLARITY] The transition from the hare incident to the curate and Eileen's dialogue is abrupt and lacks contextual clarity  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the curate and Eileen's emotional conversation to the decision to move to London is not clearly connected to the preceding events  
- [LOGIC] The curate's detailed explanation about clergy and poverty feels out of place in the context of the story's tone and flow
