1) Fluency Issues:

- [SYNTAX] "We had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared" (awkward transition)  
- [LEXICON] "ploughed on" (slang or archaic phrasing that may confuse modern readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in dialogue tags and after introductory phrases  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrative from following a man to a completely new scene with no clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition to a new chapter (Chapter II) is abrupt and lacks context  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the man being followed is never clearly explained  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the chase to the golf course and the discovery of the dog is jarring and lacks smooth connection
