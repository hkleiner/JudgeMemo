Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was even now in search of the gardener's boy, who would be commissioned to perform the duties of sexton." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "r√¥le" (non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "Gas was administered with a bicycle pump..." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "administered with a bicycle pump" (inappropriate word choice for the context)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was particularly attracted by babies; and being able by reason of his stature to look right down into perambulators..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "damsel" (archaic and potentially confusing word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was a very large shoulder of mutton, but Excalibur finished it in ten minutes." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Joy Day" (unclear reference, possibly a typo or misused term)  
- [SYNTAX] "He could not remember where he had buried the bone!" (sudden shift in tone and phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "hyena-like howls rent the air" (somewhat archaic phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the story of Excalibur and the mutton to the dinner party with Lady Wickham (lack of smooth transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The story of Excalibur's walk through the village is introduced abruptly after the dinner party anecdote (disjointed structure)  
- [CLARITY] "Joy Day" is unclear in meaning and disrupts the narrative flow  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Excalibur's bone-burying behavior to the dinner party is abrupt and lacks logical connection  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the dinner party to the village walk is not clearly connected or explained  
- [LOGIC] The rabbit's behavior is described in a way that is inconsistent with the overall tone and character of Excalibur  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Excalibur's intellect may have been lofty, but his memory was treacherous" is somewhat vague and not clearly supported by the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
