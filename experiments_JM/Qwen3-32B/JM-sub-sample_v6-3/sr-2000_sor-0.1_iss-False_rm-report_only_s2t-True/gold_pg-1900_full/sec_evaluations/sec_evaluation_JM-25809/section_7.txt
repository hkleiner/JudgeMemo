- [SPELLING] "Bime-by," (non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had to climb down sixty feet of ladder, fill his bucket, climb up again and dump it, and so on and so on and so on." (repetition and awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "cussed ol' car" (inconsistent register and spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "There was at once something fascinating and heroic in the rippling glide of the muscles over his broad back, and in the supple swing that sent the pick to join the packed dirt." (cumbersome phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "der crik" (non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "He loved to hunt but he hated to kill." (awkward transition)

- [STRUCTURE] The hunting trip section feels disconnected from the main narrative about tunneling

- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of the evening to the hunting trip  
- [LOGIC] The deer's behavior and Jim's attempt to catch it is confusing and lacks clear motivation  
- [CLARITY] "The next ten seconds was delirium..." (confusing description of the action)
