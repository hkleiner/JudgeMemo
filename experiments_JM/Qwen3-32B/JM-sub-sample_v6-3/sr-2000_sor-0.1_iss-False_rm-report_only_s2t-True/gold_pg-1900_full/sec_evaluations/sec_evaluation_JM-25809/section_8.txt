Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The next ten seconds was delirium" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "sojering" (likely a misspelling of "sojourning" or "sojourning")  
- [SYNTAX] "He'd have gone down the flume, if I hadn't got hold of his bridle" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "red-eye" (unclear without context; could be a slang term or typo)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in dialogue tags and run-on sentences  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the deer fight to Bud's conversation with Jim with no clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the fight and the backstory of Ches without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the lad" and "the inspector" is unclear without prior context  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the fight scene to the mail inspector's story  
- [CONSISTENCY] The shift in tone from action to exposition is jarring and not well integrated  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
