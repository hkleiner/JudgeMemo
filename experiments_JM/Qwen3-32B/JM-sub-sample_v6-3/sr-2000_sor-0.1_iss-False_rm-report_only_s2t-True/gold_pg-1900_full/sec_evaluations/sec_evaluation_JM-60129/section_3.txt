2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text is highly detailed and dense, but the structure is somewhat fragmented, with abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from marriage customs to funeral rites to language).  
- [LOGIC] The transition from describing the physical appearance of the tribe to their customs is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The section on marriage customs is lengthy and detailed, but the flow between sub-topics (e.g., inheritance, marriage arrangements, wedding ceremonies) is not always smooth.  
- [LOGIC] The section on language and vocabulary is introduced abruptly after a detailed description of customs and rituals.  
- [LOGIC] The statistical data is presented without a clear transition from the preceding cultural descriptions, making the shift jarring.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the possible falsification of statistics is introduced without a clear link to the preceding data, making the connection unclear.
