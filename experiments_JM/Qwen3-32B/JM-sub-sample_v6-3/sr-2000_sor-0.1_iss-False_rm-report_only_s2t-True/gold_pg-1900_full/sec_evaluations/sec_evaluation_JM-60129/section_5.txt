Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "some dozens of houses, were grouped" (misplaced comma)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a k'ang heated with coal and dry manure, which is lifted into the room by removing a board or two in the ceiling takes up nearly all the space" (awkward phrasing and missing comma)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The lamas scarlet mantles, highcombed head dresses, staffs and other insignia were lying" (missing article "the" before "scarlet mantles")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The gegen of the monastery, their Shke lama (Great Lama) Buddha's reincarnation, was still a child" (awkward phrasing and missing comma after "Buddha's reincarnation")  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had succeeded the last Shke lama, who died eight or nine years ago, but was only brought to K'anglungssu for the solemnizing of great ceremonies, occuring every sixth and twelfth Chinese moon" (missing hyphen in "occurring" and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Only a small percentage of the lamas are able to read the Tangutan language, they have nothing to do with medicine" (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The sunburnt grass had in the sunshine a warm sandstone colour against which the grey mountain ridge with its dark border of fir-trees stood out effectively" (awkward phrasing and word order)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed descriptions of architecture and rituals without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the temple and its contents is dense and at times confusing, with overlapping details that are hard to follow.  
- [CLARITY] Some terms (e.g., "t'umu," "Stonba," "Shagdur") are introduced without explanation, making the text less accessible.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the temple to the lamas' daily life and then to the author's departure is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph describing the landscape and departure is somewhat disconnected from the preceding detailed descriptions of the monastery.
