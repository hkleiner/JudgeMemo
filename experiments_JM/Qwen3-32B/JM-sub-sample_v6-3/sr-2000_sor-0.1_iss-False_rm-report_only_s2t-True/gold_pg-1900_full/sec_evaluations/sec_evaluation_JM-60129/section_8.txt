- [LEXICON] "The Ta fumu had an exceptionally good ear for foreign languages..." (unclear reference to "Ta fumu")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The navel-string is cut with a pair of scissors or a bit of pottery." (awkward phrasing and missing comma for clarity)  
- [SYNTAX] "The women are often childless, but do not attempt to cure sterility by eating herbs, only by having prayers read." (awkward structure and missing preposition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The first teeth show themselves when the child is about eight months old, and milk-teeth are replaced at eleven years of age." (awkward phrasing and inconsistent verb form)
