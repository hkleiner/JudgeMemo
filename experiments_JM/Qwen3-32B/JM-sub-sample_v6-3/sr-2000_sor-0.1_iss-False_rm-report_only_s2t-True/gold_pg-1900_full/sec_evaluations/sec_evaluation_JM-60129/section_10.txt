Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "imbedded" (should be "embedded")  
- [SPELLING] "reined iu my horse" (should be "reined in my horse")  
- [SPELLING] "tshuavá and sujá" (unusual spelling, possibly non-standard transliteration)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the river forming a wide bend, open to the north, pours its waters..." (awkward phrasing, missing prepositions or commas for clarity)  
- [GRAMMAR] "they precipitate themselves headlong down to the water along the left shore" (awkward and unclear phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the deaf old gentlemen's politeness went so far as to promise me on my next visit (!) five sable skins" (awkward punctuation and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from a farewell scene to a detailed geographical description without clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the valley and river is detailed but lacks a clear narrative thread or purpose, making it feel like a list rather than a coherent journey.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the great Lansor's or Neiman-gol valley" is unclear and lacks context for the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the landscape to the town of Li-yen is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "doukey caravans" is unclear and lacks explanation for the reader unfamiliar with the term.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
