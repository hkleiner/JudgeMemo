- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between descriptions of food, daily life, religious practices, and hunting in a somewhat disjointed manner  
- [CLARITY] "The live stock I saw, was good of its kind." (awkward phrasing and unclear subject-verb agreement)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from describing the tents to the livestock and then to the Dungan revolt without clear connection
