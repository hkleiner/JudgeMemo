- [CLARITY] The legend about the Yögurs' origin is introduced abruptly and is not clearly connected to the rest of the narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The discussion of the Yögur language and its relation to other languages is presented without clear context or explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different topics (e.g., the village, the temple, the lamas, the administration) without clear signposting.
