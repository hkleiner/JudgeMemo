Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The infantry contented itself with a menacing demonstration, but the cavalry attacked up the Jerusalem Plank Road." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The damage done by such raids was quickly patched up, but they were a constant nuisance to the city’s transportation lines." (Ambiguous reference to "they")  
- [SPELLING] "The 55 artillery batteries were consecutively numbered from east to west." (Missing article "the" before "55 artillery batteries")  
- [LEXICON] "The very length and size of the fortifications proved to be a disadvantage." (Word choice could be clearer)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Maj. Gen. W. F. “Baldy” Smith" (Inconsistent quotation mark usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The damage done by such raids was quickly patched up, but they were a constant nuisance..." (Sudden shift in focus from damage to ongoing issues)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The third day of battle was practically a repetition of that of the preceding day." (Repetition and lack of new information)  
- [TRANSITION] "A general assault by the Union forces was ordered for 4 a.m. on June 18." (Abrupt transition from previous events to the next action)  
- [CLARITY] "The area where the left flank of the Dimmock Line anchored on the Appomattox was empty..." (Ambiguous reference to "the left flank")  
- [LOGIC] "The Northern troops came on, crossing the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad west of where the defenders had constructed their new line..." (Confusing spatial reference)
