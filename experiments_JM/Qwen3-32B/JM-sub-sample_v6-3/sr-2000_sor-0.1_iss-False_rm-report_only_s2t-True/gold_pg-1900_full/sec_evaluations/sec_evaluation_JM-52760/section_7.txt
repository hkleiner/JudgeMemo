Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The discouragement of the homesick, who never knew when, or if, they would return to their homes, was a hardship not peculiar to any rank."  
- [SPELLING] "ad libitum" is correctly spelled but may be unfamiliar to some readers, though not a fluency error per se.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some complex sentences, e.g., "The Petersburg campaign was grim business. Amusements could lighten the heart for only a brief time at best."  
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are overly formal or archaic, e.g., "profusion" and "ad libitum," which may slightly disrupt natural flow.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from a general description of the Petersburg campaign to a detailed account of the Fort Stedman attack without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The section on Fort Stedman is well-structured, but the preceding paragraph on the general conditions of the campaign feels disconnected from the detailed battle narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "FORT GREGG, FORT MAHONE, FORT SEDGWICK, FORT FISHER" is unclear in context and lacks explanation or relevance to the surrounding text.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the general overview of the war to the specific battle of Fort Stedman is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
