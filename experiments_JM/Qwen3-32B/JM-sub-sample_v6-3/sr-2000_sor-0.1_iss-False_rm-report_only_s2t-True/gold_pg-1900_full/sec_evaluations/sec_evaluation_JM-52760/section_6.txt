Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The general plan of operations was nearly the same as that used at Peebles’ farm." (possessive apostrophe inconsistency)  
- [SPELLING] "Burgess’ Mill" (inconsistent use of possessive apostrophe)  
- [SYNTAX] "The failure of Union Generals Hancock of the II Corps and Warren of the V Corps to coordinate the efforts of their respective columns..." (awkward phrasing and repetition)  
- [LEXICON] "The slackening of hostile action was used to good advantage by Union and Confederate alike..." (word choice could be clearer)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The enlisted men of both armies, however, remained largely unaware of the strategy of their commanders." (awkward placement of "however")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between detailed battle descriptions and broader strategic overviews without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the description of soldier life and the mention of "special artists" is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the Battle of Hatcher’s Run to the broader campaign summary is not clearly signaled.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph on soldier life is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear focus.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the "special artists" is isolated and not clearly tied to the preceding or following content.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
