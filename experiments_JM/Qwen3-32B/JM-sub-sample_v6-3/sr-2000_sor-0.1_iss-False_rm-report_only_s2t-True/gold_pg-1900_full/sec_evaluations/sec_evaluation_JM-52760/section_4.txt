Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Confederates had learned of the mine by this time and had dug several countermines behind their own lines in an effort to locate the Union gallery." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SYNTAX] "Although digging in the countermines continued throughout July, Confederate fears seemed to lessen during the same period." (awkward parallelism)  
- [LEXICON] "The object was to draw as many of Leeâ€™s soldiers away from Petersburg as possible." (slightly informal phrasing for a historical text)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "The next step in the Union plan was to burrow out into lateral galleries at the end of the long shaft."  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some phrasing is repetitive or awkward.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the description of the tunnel to the Union attack plan without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between the construction of the tunnel and the battle sequence without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the technical description of the tunnel and the military strategy.  
- [LOGIC] The explanation of the Confederate countermeasures is not clearly connected to the Union's subsequent actions.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
