Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "It was discovered at 3 a.m. that the Southern earthworks had been abandoned; an attack was not necessary." (awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "President Lincoln, who had been in the vicinity of Petersburg for more than a week, came from army headquarters at City Point that same day for a brief visit with Grant." (cumbersome sentence structure) - [LEXICON] "The close of the day found the weary Confederates concentrating within Petersburg..." (passive voice and word choice could be clearer)

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] "The result had been the capture of Petersburg and Richmond, but more important, it had led to the flight of the remnants of the once mighty Army of Northern Virginia." (sudden shift in focus from military strategy to consequences) - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from the immediate aftermath of the fall of Petersburg to the broader consequences of the war without clear transitions. - [CLARITY] "Grant had ordered the assault on Petersburg to be renewed early on April 3. It was discovered at 3 a.m. that the Southern earthworks had been abandoned..." (sudden shift in time and perspective)

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
