Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The caps were promptly torn to shreds by a volley of minié balls." (missing apostrophe in "minié")  
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The transition from the battle at the crater to the broader campaign context is abrupt and lacks clear connection. - [STRUCTURE] The section jumps from the immediate aftermath of the battle to a summary of casualties and broader strategic implications without smooth transitions.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
