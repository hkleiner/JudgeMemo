Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The transportation vehicles of the 1860’s did not require the wide, straight highways of the present." (Awkward phrasing and unclear comparison)  
- [SYNTAX] "However, several good roads came into the city from the east, south, and west where they joined with the Richmond Turnpike." (Ambiguous reference to "where")  
- [LEXICON] "It was situated on the southern bank of the Appomattox River about 8 miles from City Point, where the Appomattox joins the James, and 23 miles south of Richmond." (Cumbersome phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph on Petersburg is abruptly cut off, leaving the reader without a clear conclusion or transition to the next section.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph on Petersburg’s strategic importance is concise but lacks a clear connection to the broader narrative of the campaign, making it feel slightly isolated.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the broader campaign narrative to a detailed description of Petersburg is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
