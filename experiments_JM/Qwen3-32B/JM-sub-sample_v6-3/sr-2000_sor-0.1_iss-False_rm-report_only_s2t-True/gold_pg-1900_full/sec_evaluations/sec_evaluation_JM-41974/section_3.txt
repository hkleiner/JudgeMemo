Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he had arrived in Venice at a propitious hour" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Lo Schiavone" (inconsistent spelling with later "Lo Schiavene")  
- [SYNTAX] "he painted trophies, garlands, flowers, even statues, possessing all the lustre and relief of marble" (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "he conceived imaginary doors, before which fictitious lacqueys appeared to be standing" (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Veronese, who was a prodigiously fertile artist, left not a single space in Barbaro's house unoccupied with colour" (awkward comma placement)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Which of the three artists proved superior it is impossible to decide to-day" (awkward phrasing disrupts logical flow)  
- [STRUCTURE] "Sansovino having completed the construction of the library, the procurators instructed the architect to arrange with Titian..." (abrupt transition)  
- [CLARITY] "Veronese was immediately designated, together with Zelotti, Batista Franco, Giuseppe Salviati, Lo Schiavene and Il Fratina" (confusing list with inconsistent names)  
- [TRANSITION] "These great official works did not diminish the number of his productions for churches..." (sudden shift in focus)  
- [LOGIC] "The contract drawn up between Veronese and the Prior of San Giorgio Maggiore for the execution of this picture has been preserved" (sudden shift to contract details disrupts narrative flow)
