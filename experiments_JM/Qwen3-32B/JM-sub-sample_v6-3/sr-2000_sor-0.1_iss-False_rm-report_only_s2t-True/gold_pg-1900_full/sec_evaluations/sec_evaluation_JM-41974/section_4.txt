- [GRAMMAR] "in abounding charming details" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "that do not in the least detract from the effect of the painting as a whole" (awkward structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "To take issue with the incongruities and anachronisms of the Wedding at Cana, is voluntarily to debar oneself from discussing it" (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "painting has no need to justify itself to history" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "he drew them from his surroundings and from his own imagination" (repetition of "from")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The groom, a handsome, black bearded young man, clad in purple and gold, is no other than Alphonso d'Avalos, Marquis del Vasto" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Beside the Sultan is a woman richly robed and holding a tooth-pick" (awkward phrasing)

- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the painting's composition to the artist's subsequent commissions and the Inquisition chapter  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from the Inquisition chapter to the Journey to Rome chapter without clear narrative link  
- [CLARITY] Some references to historical figures and events are unclear without additional context  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different topics (artistic analysis, historical context, legal issues, biographical details) without clear organization
