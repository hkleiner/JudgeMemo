Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He had a boyhood friend, Battista Zelotti, a painter like himself, and also like himself tormented by dreams of glory."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "He ran the danger of acquiring mannerisms and becoming an imitator."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or overly elaborate language that may hinder clarity for some readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in long sentences, e.g., "We have no reliable document regarding these first years of his residence there, nor even of the impressions produced upon him by the opulent and magnificent city."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in focus from Veronese's early career to his time in Venice without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Some ideas are introduced without sufficient context, e.g., "Caliari betook himself to Venice, the Promised Land..." assumes prior knowledge.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of Venice to the discussion of other painters.  
- [CLARITY] The passage is dense and at times repetitive, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.
