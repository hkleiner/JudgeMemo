Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Being purchased by Rebecca Fenley, who was a daughter of Mrs. John S. Roberts" (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "The Old Stone Fort remained in the Roberts family until it was purchased by Perkins Brothers in 1901; after which it was torn down..." (awkward transition and semicolon misuse)  
- [LEXICON] "The material given to the Cum Concilio Club of Nacogdoches, who used the stones..." (passive voice and unclear subject)  
- [SPELLING] "drouth" (archaic spelling, not an error but may be considered inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The fourth church was the Sacred Heart church on Pecan street, built in 1847 under the influence of Bishop J. N. Odin; which was in turn replaced..." (awkward phrasing and missing comma)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the history of the Old Stone Fort to "THE MISSIONS AND PRESIDIO" without transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed sections with no clear progression (e.g., jumping from the Fort to the Missions, then to the Stage Stand, then to the Eyes of Father Margil)  
- [CLARITY] Lack of clear connection between the main narrative and the various historical anecdotes (e.g., "EYES OF FATHER MARGIL" and "GRAVE OF WILLIAM GOYENS")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between unrelated topics (e.g., from the Fort to the Oak Grove Cemetery to the Goyens family cemetery)  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of information about the Sacred Heart church and its multiple relocations without clear organization  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
