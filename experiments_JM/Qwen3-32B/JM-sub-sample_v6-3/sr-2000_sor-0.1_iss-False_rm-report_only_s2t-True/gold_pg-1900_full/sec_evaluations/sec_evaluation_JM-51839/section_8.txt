Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The sum allocated by the board has been used discreetly and the replacement of brick on outside walls..." (awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "new window frames and panes with new lumber added supporting the antiquated structure" (awkward syntax) - [LEXICON] "We feel that now is the time to emulate the spirit of the pioneers" (somewhat vague phrasing)
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from historical information about the university building to a call to action without clear transition - [LOGIC] The connection between the historical information and the current rebuilding project is not clearly established - [CLARITY] The purpose of the text (to inform about the rebuilding project and encourage completion) is somewhat unclear in the final paragraph
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
