Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the riding-horse and pack-horse had hardly given place to the coach and waggon before the railway superseded road traffic" (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SPELLING] "waggon" (British spelling, but inconsistent with "railway" and "traffic")  
- [SYNTAX] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the fire of patriotism in Spain, in Germany, and even in Russia" (repetition of "in")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The French Revolution, which coincided with its first stages, helped to break the continuity between the old order and the new" (awkward placement of the relative clause)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." (sudden shift in focus without clear connection to prior ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The most modest democratic reforms were therefore impossible till Napoleon was out of the way..." (sudden jump in time and cause-effect logic)  
- [TRANSITION] "Men of letters who lamented this isolation now turned for inspiration rather to Germany than to France." (abrupt transition without clear explanation)  
- [CLARITY] "The eighteenth century had been international; there was no Chauvinism or Jingoism anywhere till the French..." (unclear connection between internationalism and nationalism)  
- [LOGIC] "The French Revolution, which coincided with its first stages, helped to break the continuity between the old order and the new" (confusing reference to "its first stages")  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
