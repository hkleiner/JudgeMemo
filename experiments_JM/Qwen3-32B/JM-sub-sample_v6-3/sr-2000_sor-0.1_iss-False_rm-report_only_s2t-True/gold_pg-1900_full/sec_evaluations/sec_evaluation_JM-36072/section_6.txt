Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is no time to speak at length of the Victorian novel, another bright star in the firmament of the reign." (Awkward phrasing and unclear reference to "the reign")  
- [SYNTAX] "The palmiest day of English novel-writing was in the fifties, when Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte BrontÃ«, George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Kingsley, Disraeli, Bulwer Lytton and Meredith were all writing." (Cumbersome list with missing Oxford comma)  
- [SPELLING] "The palmiest day" (Uncommon and awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "The cataract of ink" (Unnatural phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The great novelists have generally written rapidly, rather too rapidly; but such a cataract of ink as these heroes of the circulating library spill is absolutely inconsistent with even second-rate work." (Awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "They obviously turn out several books a year, just as a shoemaker manufactures so many pairs of boots." (Slightly awkward comparison)  
- [SYNTAX] "The fusion of social classes proceeded more and more rapidly as the century went on." (Wordy and repetitive)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The way was prepared for the complete destruction of social barriers which the Great War effected." (Awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Parasitism at both ends of the scale, but far most at the lower, became an ever-increasing burden on industry..." (Awkward phrasing and unclear meaning)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The clever craftsman of the past was functionally obsolescent..." (Unnatural phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different themes (literature, social class, industrialization) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "The second Jubilee was its day of triumph; the Boer War the beginning of its downfall." (Ambiguous reference to "its")  
- [LOGIC] "The fusion of social classes proceeded more and more rapidly as the century went on." (This is stated but not clearly connected to the previous discussion of literature)  
- [LOGIC] "The way was prepared for the complete destruction of social barriers which the Great War effected." (Sudden jump to the Great War without clear connection to the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "Parasitism at both ends of the scale, but far most at the lower, became an ever-increasing burden on industry..." (Unclear and disjointed from the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "The great industry was turning human beings into mere cogs in machines..." (Sudden shift to industrialization without clear connection to the previous discussion of social class)  
- [LOGIC] "I have no doubt that the Elizabethan and the Victorian Ages will appear to the historian of the future as the twin peaks in which English civilisation culminated." (Sudden conclusion without clear transition from the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "Europe has sacrificed its last fifty years of primacy by an insane and suicidal struggle." (Sudden shift to Europe and America without clear connection to the previous paragraph)
