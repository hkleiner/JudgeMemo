Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The great Attic tragedians lived as long as Tennyson and Browning; the Greek philosophers reached as great ages as Victorian theologians..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "He has followed other and still greater models, Spenser and Milton."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous or overly complex phrasing in "Modern research has unburied the unsavoury story..."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and lack of clarity in long sentences  
- [SPELLING] "unsavoury" is British English; may be inconsistent with expected dialect  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Tennyson's poetry to broader Victorian social and religious issues without clear transitions  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple topics (Tennyson's poetry, Victorian values, religion, and modern criticism) without clear organization  
- [CLARITY] Some ideas are expressed in a dense and abstract manner, making the overall argument difficult to follow  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between paragraphs discussing different aspects of Tennyson's work and Victorian society  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
