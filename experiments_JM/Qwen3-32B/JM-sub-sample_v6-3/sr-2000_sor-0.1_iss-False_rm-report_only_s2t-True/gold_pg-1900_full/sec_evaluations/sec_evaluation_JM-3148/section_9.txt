Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "she ’bout feeds that boy o’ Croft’s" (non-standard grammar)  
- [SPELLING] "awstensibly" (misspelled word)  
- [SPELLING] "cowpons" (misspelled word)  
- [LEXICON] "middlin’ wealthy" (dialectal phrasing may be distracting for some readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "It’s a pity she ain’t deef, so ’t she can’t hear his everlastin’ fiddle." (awkward phrasing and non-standard syntax)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from a prayerful and introspective tone to a narrative about Davy’s recovery and Anthony’s life (lack of clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly shifts from a prayer to a new chapter and then to a character’s commentary (Aunt Hitty Tarbox), which may confuse readers expecting a more linear progression  
- [CLARITY] The final section with Aunt Hitty Tarbox is written in a dialectal style that contrasts sharply with the rest of the text, potentially disrupting the reader’s immersion  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the prayer to the new chapter and then to Aunt Hitty’s commentary is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
