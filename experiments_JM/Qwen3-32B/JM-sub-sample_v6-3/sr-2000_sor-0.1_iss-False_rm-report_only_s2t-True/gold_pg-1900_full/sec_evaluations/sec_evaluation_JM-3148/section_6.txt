Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "She gives considerable stuff to her hens that she’d a sight better heat over and eat herself" (awkward phrasing and non-standard grammar)  
- [SPELLING] "narrer" (misspelling of "narrower")  
- [SYNTAX] "I should stand it till ’bout Friday—seein’ ’em lay on the grass there—but if she didn’t take ’em in then, I should go over and offer to help her" (awkward and fragmented sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "She may be bleachin’ of ’em out, but it looks slack" (unclear phrasing and informal diction)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I can even believe she was glad to have died, since her dying could bring such content to any wretched living human soul" (awkward phrasing and unclear punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Lyddy’s domestic habits to her emotional transformation is abrupt and lacks clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The shift from describing Lyddy’s actions to the poetic description of Anthony Croft’s violin is jarring and lacks smooth transition  
- [CLARITY] The description of Anthony Croft and his music is rich but lacks a clear narrative progression or purpose in the context of the story  
- [TRANSITION] The introduction of the poem by Shelley is sudden and not clearly integrated into the narrative flow  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
