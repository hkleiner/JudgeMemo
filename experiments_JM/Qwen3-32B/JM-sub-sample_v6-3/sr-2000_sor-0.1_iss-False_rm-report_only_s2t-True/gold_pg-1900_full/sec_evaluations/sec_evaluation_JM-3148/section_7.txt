Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "I’ll find the butter in the twinkling of an eye, though why you want it now is more than—" (sentence fragment) - [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "But I can’t let a stranger come in and do my housework," - [SPELLING] "mendacious" (likely a typo, should be "mendicant" or "mendacious" is correct but unexpected in context) - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "You seem to be rather in the way here, and I should like the place to myself, if you’ll excuse me for saying so."
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Lyddy helping Anthony to her asking him to go out in the orchard feels abrupt - [TRANSITION] Unclear transition from Lyddy's internal thoughts about speaking freely to the blind man to the practical action of helping with the boy - [CLARITY] The phrase "I’ll call you if you can help or advise me" is confusing as it contradicts her previous request for him to leave
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
