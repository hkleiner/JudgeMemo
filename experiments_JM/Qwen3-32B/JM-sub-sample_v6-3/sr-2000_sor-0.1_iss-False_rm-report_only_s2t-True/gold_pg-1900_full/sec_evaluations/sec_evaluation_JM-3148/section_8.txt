Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "She very happy! She with power—power to make things straight..." (missing article before "very happy") - [PUNCTUATION] "He took off his hat unconsciously as he entered Lyddy’s sitting-room. A gentle breeze..." (missing transition between sentences) - [SYNTAX] "The ribbon would be red; the woman who arranged this room would make no mistake..." (awkward phrasing)
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Lyddy's actions to Anthony's internal thoughts about his mother without clear transition - [STRUCTURE] The text moves between multiple locations (apple-trees, Lyddy's house, etc.) without clear markers of time or place - [CLARITY] The meaning of "saving stars that light the eternal darkness of the blind" is metaphorical and could be confusing - [TRANSITION] The transition from Lyddy's actions to Anthony's reflections on his life is abrupt
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
