Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It seems as if six shirts at one time must mean something out o’ the common!" (contraction "o’" is inconsistent with the rest of the formal tone)  
- [SPELLING] "out o’ the common" (informal contraction "o’" is jarring)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had the wit and wisdom to put her affliction quite out of the question, and allude only to her sacrifice in marrying a blind man, hopelessly and helplessly dependent on her sweet offices for the rest of his life, if she, in her womanly mercy, would love him and help him bear his burdens." (long, complex sentence with multiple clauses is difficult to follow)  
- [LEXICON] "ministered unto by Lyddy’s kind hands" (archaic phrasing "unto" is inconsistent with the rest of the text)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He had heard all her sad history by this time, though not from her own lips, and his heart went out to her all the more for the heavy cross that had been laid upon her." (awkward placement of "though not from her own lips" disrupts flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of Anthony and Lyddy's relationship to the detailed description of Anthony's musical process is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between different scenes (Anthony and Lyddy in the orchard, Davy reading, Lyddy sewing) without clear transitions or logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The description of Anthony's musical process with the wires and wooden pegs is complex and could be confusing to the reader without prior knowledge of the system.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the emotional description of Anthony and Lyddy's love to the technical explanation of Anthony's music lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of Davy and his role in interpreting Anthony's music is introduced without sufficient context or explanation.
