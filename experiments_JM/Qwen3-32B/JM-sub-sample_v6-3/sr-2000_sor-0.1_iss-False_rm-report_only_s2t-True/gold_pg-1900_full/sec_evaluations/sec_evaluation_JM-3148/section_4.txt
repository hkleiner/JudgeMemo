Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He knows how the drill and pressure of the daily task, still more the presence of the high ideal, the inspiration working from within, how these educate us."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing punctuation in long, complex sentences, such as "The blind Anthony Croft sitting in the kitchen doorway had seemingly missed the heights of life he might have trod, and had walked his close on fifty years through level meadows of mediocrity..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or poetic language that may confuse readers, such as "imperious genius surmounts all obstacles, brushes laws and formulas from its horizon."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in run-on sentences, e.g., "He was not able to realise his ideals, but he had the angel aim by which he idealised his reals."  
- [SPELLING] "realised" and "idealised" are British spellings; while not incorrect, they may be inconsistent with the rest of the text if it follows American English conventions.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Anthony Croft's character to the death of Mrs. Butterfield with no clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative abruptly moves from a philosophical reflection on Anthony to a detailed description of a funeral, making the connection between the two unclear.  
- [CLARITY] The metaphor-heavy language in the first section (e.g., "witch in every finger-tip waiting to be set to work") is vague and difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the chapter heading and the new section is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The description of Aunt Hitty's funeral planning is detailed but lacks a clear connection to Anthony Croft or the earlier philosophical themes.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
