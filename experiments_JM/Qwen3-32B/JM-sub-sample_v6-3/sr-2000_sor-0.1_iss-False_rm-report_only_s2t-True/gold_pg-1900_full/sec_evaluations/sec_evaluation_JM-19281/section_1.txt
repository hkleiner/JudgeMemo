Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the Divine authority that had functioned as the focal centre of guidance--however diverse the interpretations of its nature--seemed simply to have dissolved and vanished." - [LEXICON] Overly complex or archaic word choice in "civilizing of human nature had been violently wrenched out of the orbit it had followed for millennia." - [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "Having penetrated and captured all significant centres of power and information at the global level, dogmatic materialism ensured that no competing voices would retain the ability to challenge projects of world wide economic exploitation." - [SPELLING] Missing hyphen in "world wide" - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structure in "To the cultural damage already inflicted by two centuries of colonial rule was added an agonizing disjunction between the inner and outer experience of the masses affected, a condition invading virtually all aspects of life."

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between discussing Western materialism and non-Western spiritual beliefs without clear transitions. - [LOGIC] The connection between the historical analysis of the 20th century and the current resurgence of religion is not always clearly established. - [CLARITY] Some concepts like "agonizing disjunction between the inner and outer experience" are abstract and could be more clearly explained. - [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing the state of religion at the end of the 20th century to the current resurgence lacks a smooth transition. - [LOGIC] The text presents a complex argument about the relationship between materialism and spirituality without always making the logical connections explicit.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
