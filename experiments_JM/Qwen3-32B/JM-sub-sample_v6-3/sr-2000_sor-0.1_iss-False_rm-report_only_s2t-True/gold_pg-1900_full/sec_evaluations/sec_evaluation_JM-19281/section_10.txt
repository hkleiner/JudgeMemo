Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Rather, are they reciprocal features" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SYNTAX] "He will need to determine, in the privacy of his own conscience and without pressure, the spiritual responsibility this discovery entails" (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "the never-ending continuum of spiritual search" (redundant phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the mind's unaided capacity to devise and construct an ideal society, however great the material resources harnessed to the effort" (awkward and wordy)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "There is no ambiguity about Bahá'u'lláh's words on the subject and there can be none in the minds of those who seek to serve Him"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the role of the Bahá'í community to the nature of spiritual conviction without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from the role of the individual to the broader historical and eschatological context without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "The Divine Plan bequeathed it by the Master is the means by which this work is carried out" (confusing reference to "it")  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transitions between the discussion of the Bahá'í mission and the broader religious and historical context  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new metaphor (stars, breeze, waters) without clear connection to the preceding argument  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
