Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "In order that the spiritual capacities appealed to by the prophets might awaken and flourish..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of complex or archaic vocabulary that may hinder clarity (e.g., "condign punishments", "inducements offered by neighbouring idolatrous cultures")  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "the punishments that befell both rulers and subjects who violated the principle illustrated the importance attached to it by the Divine purpose"  
- [PUNCTUATION] Some run-on sentences that could benefit from clearer punctuation or division  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical examples (Hebrew people, Muhammad, modern times) without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] Some ideas are introduced without sufficient context or explanation, making it difficult to follow the argument (e.g., "the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether")  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the historical examples and the broader thesis is not always clearly articulated  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between paragraphs and ideas, especially between the discussion of religion and the introduction of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
