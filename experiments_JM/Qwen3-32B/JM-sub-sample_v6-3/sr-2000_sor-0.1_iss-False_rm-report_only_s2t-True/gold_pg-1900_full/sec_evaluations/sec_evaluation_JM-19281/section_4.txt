Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Not surprisingly, such a suggestion at once arouses protest in other quarters that by religion is intended rather one or another..." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "Where, precisely, are 'Judaism', 'Buddhism', 'Christianity', 'Isl치m' and the others..." (inconsistent capitalization and punctuation)  
- [LEXICON] "the instrumentality through which the Creator of all things interacts..." (word choice is overly formal and slightly awkward)  
- [SPELLING] "Isl치m" (non-standard spelling of "Islam")  
- [SYNTAX] "To presume to judge among the Messengers of God, exalting one above the other..." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is an impulse that will not be denied." (somewhat vague and lacks clarity)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and specific religious references without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is complex and layered, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas without prior context.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense, reducing readability and clarity.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing the nature of religion to the teachings of Bah치'u'll치h is abrupt and lacks a clear bridge.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces new ideas without clearly connecting them to the previous discussion.
