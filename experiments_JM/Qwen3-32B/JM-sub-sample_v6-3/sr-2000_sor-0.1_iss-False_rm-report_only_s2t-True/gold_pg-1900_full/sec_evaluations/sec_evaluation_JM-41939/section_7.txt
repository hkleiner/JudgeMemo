Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Her age was not betrayed in any of her works, which had the appearance of having been painted in the flood-tide of youth." – Awkward phrasing and unclear use of "flood-tide of youth."  
- [SYNTAX] "contrary to her habit, she sent to the Salon." – Missing preposition ("to the Salon" should be "to the Salon" but the phrase is syntactically incomplete without context).  
- [LEXICON] "flood-tide of youth" – Uncommon and potentially confusing phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "the entire press paid tribute to the dignity of her life, the nobility of her character, the greatness of her talent." – Cumulative structure is acceptable but slightly repetitive.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing her final painting to her death is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the cortège and public reaction is well-structured but could be more tightly connected to the preceding paragraph about her death.  
- [CLARITY] "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity." – Slightly vague and metaphorical, which may confuse some readers.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from her death to the public reaction is abrupt and lacks a clear transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
