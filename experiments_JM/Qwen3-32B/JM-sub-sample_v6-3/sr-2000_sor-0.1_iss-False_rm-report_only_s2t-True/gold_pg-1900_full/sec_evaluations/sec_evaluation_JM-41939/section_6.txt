Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "A French woman before all else, she submitted in advance to all the abuses and exigencies of the conquerors."  
- [SPELLING] "panthers" is a misspelling of "panthers" (correct is "panthers" or "panthers" depending on intended meaning).  
- [GRAMMAR] "In all the animals that she painted,--and she painted nearly all the animals there are,--Rosa Bonheur succeeded..." has unnecessary and inconsistent punctuation.  
- [LEXICON] "virility of execution" is an unusual and potentially confusing phrase.  
- [SYNTAX] "The latter, with her astounding memory and with an eye as profound and luminous as a photographic lens, caught and retained the most fugitive expressions..." is overly complex and difficult to follow.  
- [SPELLING] "By" is used multiple times without clarification, potentially confusing the reader.  
- [SYNTAX] "She noted them down with rapid and unfaltering pencil; the painting of the picture after this was a mere matter of execution." is awkwardly structured.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Rosa Bonheur's refusal to accept favours to her submission to the conquerors is abrupt and lacks explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from her artistic achievements to personal events (e.g., Mlle. Micas' death) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "By" is repeated without sufficient context, making it unclear whether it refers to a place or a person.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing her paintings to receiving decorations and then to her friendship with Miss Klumpke is disjointed.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "The Duel" and "The Threshing of the Grain" appears at the end without a clear narrative purpose or connection to the preceding content.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "The latter, whom he had met in former years" in the context section is unclear and may confuse the reader when reading the current section.
