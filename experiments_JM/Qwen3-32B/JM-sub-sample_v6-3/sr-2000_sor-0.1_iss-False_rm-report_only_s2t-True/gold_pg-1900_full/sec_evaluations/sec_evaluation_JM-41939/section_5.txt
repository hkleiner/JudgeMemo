Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "She had too high a regard for line-work to fail to bring to her task as teacher all of her ardent faith as an artist." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "She divided the scheme of instruction into two series, one of the great studies of animals and the other of little studies." (repetition and redundancy)  
- [LEXICON] "She would grow indignant: 'Go back to your mother, and mend your stockings or do embroidery work.'" (sudden shift in tone and register)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "In 1865, Changing Pasture, A Family of Roebuck; 1867, Kids Resting; 1868, Shetland Ponies; 1869, Sheep in Brittany; 1870, The Cartload of Stones." (inconsistent punctuation)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from Rosa Bonheur's teaching career to her personal life and artistic output without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the war of 1870 appears somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion of her art school and studio life.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the host of works that the artist put forth at this period" is vague and lacks specific context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about the Prussian officer to the final paragraph is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
