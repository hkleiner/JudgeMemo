Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The reproduction which we give in the present volume was made from this smaller copy." (Awkward phrasing; "we give" is imprecise.)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was acquired later on by Mr. Gambard, the great London picture dealer, for the sum of 40,000 francs." (Awkward use of "later on.")  
- [LEXICON] "It was the good and faithful Nathalie who supervised Rosa's meals and repaired her garments." (Slightly awkward phrasing; "repaired her garments" is unusual.)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "And what is to be said of the landscape which is bathed in a clear, bright light, flecked here and there with trails of fleecy cloud?" (Comma splice or awkward punctuation.)  
- [SYNTAX] "She pretended not to understand, but nothing short of her unconquerable passion for study would have sustained her courage." (Awkward phrasing and structure.)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The reproduction which we give in the present volume was made from this smaller copy." (Slightly confusing reference to "this volume" without clear context.)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from Rosa's artistic process to the commercial history of her paintings, which may confuse the reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of *The Horse Fair* to the commercial history of the painting is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] "The reproduction which we give in the present volume was made from this smaller copy." (Unclear reference to "this volume" and "this smaller copy" without prior context.)  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about the ownership and sale of *The Horse Fair* is detailed but lacks a clear chronological or thematic thread, making it somewhat disjointed.
