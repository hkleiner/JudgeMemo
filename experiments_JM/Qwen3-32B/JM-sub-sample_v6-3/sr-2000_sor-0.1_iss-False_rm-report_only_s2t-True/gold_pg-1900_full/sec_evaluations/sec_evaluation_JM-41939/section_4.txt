Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "She had now become celebrated, and the patrons of art fought among themselves for her productions."  
- [LEXICON] Repetition of "painting" and "painter" in the same paragraph, leading to redundancy.  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical issues in "She had the Stags at Long-Rocher on my easel," where "my" should be "her."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of commas in long sentences, such as "Mingled with the divers cries of this heterogeneous menagerie, were the bewildering twitterings of an assortment of birds, the clucking of hens, the sonorous quack-quack of ducks, and dominating all the rest, the strident screams of numerous parrakeets."  
- [SPELLING] "Parrakeets" is an archaic or less common spelling; "parakeets" is more standard.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing Rosa Bonheur's menagerie to her international reputation without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the Empress's visit is abruptly inserted without clear connection to the preceding content.  
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about the French and English appreciation of her work is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear focus.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of her menagerie to her artistic output is abrupt and lacks a smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Universal Exposition of 1855 is followed by a sudden shift to her decision to stop exhibiting at the Salons, with no clear explanation of the reasoning.
