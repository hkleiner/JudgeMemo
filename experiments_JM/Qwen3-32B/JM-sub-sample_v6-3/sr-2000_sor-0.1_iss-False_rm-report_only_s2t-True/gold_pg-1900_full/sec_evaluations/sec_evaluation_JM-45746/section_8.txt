Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is no wonder, then, that vocational guidance departments, trade schools, part-time schools, and continuation schools have come into prominence during the last decade." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "To-day" is an archaic spelling; "Today" is more standard.  
- [SYNTAX] "The patron often fails to understand what the school has to offer and the pupil, with little or no definite knowledge as to what he is best fitted to do, struggles along hoping that through the aid of the school he may find himself." (long and complex sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The interest that was created by these meetings and the value of the work accomplished went beyond the expectations of the principal." (wordy phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some complex sentences, e.g., "Many of the student difficulties are due to the unfamiliarity of the parent with what the school has to offer."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the vocational guidance program to the anecdote about the gentleman criticizing the school is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The anecdote about the mayor is somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion about vocational guidance.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph introduces a new idea about changing conditions in education without clearly linking it to the previous discussion.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the club organization example to the parent's criticism lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about the schoolmaster of tomorrow feels slightly out of place and lacks a clear connection to the rest of the section.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
