Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "I must not accept just a mere job" (awkward phrasing) - [SYNTAX] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession" (cumbersome sentence structure) - [LEXICON] "Mr. ----" (incomplete name reference) - [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences (e.g., "I was forced to stop over in a small town for about two hours, in order to make connection with the train that would take me to my destination") - [SPELLING] "enterprising" (correct but could be more precise)

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the author's personal experience to the story of two young men without clear transition - [LOGIC] Jump from the author's graduation to the story of the superintendent and the school building feels abrupt - [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the two contrasting stories of the young men - [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "the situation that confronted me after deciding to become a teacher temporarily" - [LOGIC] The conclusion about one man making teaching a job and the other a profession feels somewhat abrupt after the detailed stories

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
