Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I have found in the vast majority of cases that if the board has faith..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "succeeding fall" (should be "succeeding fall" is correct, but "succeeding" is less common and may be confusing)  
- [SYNTAX] "I have had many other experiences with school boards similar to those cited above." (awkward sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "I have found in the vast majority of cases..." (repetition of "have" is slightly awkward)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "I have found in the vast majority of cases that if the board has faith in the superintendent and feels that he knows what he wants, and what he will do with it after he gets it, he will not have much difficulty in obtaining what the school really needs."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from manual training to school activities without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different topics (manual training, school activities, Seattle principal's report) without clear organization  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the Seattle principal's quote to the conclusion of the chapter  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "----" in "The boys were proud of this accomplishment and when I occasionally hear from some of them, they often remark, 'We put ---- on the map in athletics.'" is unclear and confusing  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Seattle's principal is introduced without context or explanation  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
