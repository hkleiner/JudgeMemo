Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "co√∂peration" contains a non-standard diacritic.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in some complex sentences (e.g., "I was desirous of having the members feel that the success of the school depended very largely upon having the administrative head take an active part in the deliberations").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in some sentences (e.g., "I was present promptly at eight o'clock, the time set for the meeting").  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or less common phrasing (e.g., "By Jimminy," "I had been well repaid for the time spent").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions between multiple topics (e.g., teachers' meetings, school board meetings) without clear signposting or logical flow.  
- [LOGIC] Some paragraphs introduce new ideas abruptly without sufficient connection to the previous content.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of certain sections (e.g., the detailed outline for discussing classics) is not clearly explained in relation to the broader narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the "Teachers' Meetings" and "Meeting with the School Board" chapters.
