Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted in the field of education." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "co√∂peration" (non-standard spelling)  
- [SYNTAX] "He reported that he could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (awkward structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He reported that he could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (em dash usage inconsistent with surrounding punctuation)  
- [LEXICON] "He could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (word choice could be clearer)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from discussing teacher attire to preparation and qualifications is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section shifts between multiple topics (teacher qualifications, application process, personal anecdotes) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The anecdote about the young man seeking a promotion for money contrasts with the young woman's story, but the connection is not clearly explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the young woman's story to the chapter on becoming a superintendent is abrupt and lacks a clear link.  
- [LOGIC] The section on preparing a high school program is detailed but lacks a clear connection to the earlier discussion of teacher qualifications and preparation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
