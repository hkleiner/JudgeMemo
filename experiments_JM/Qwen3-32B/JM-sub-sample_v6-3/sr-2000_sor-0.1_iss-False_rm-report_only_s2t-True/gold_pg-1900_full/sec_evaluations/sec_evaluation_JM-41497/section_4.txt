Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We owe an apology to the new President whom we left standing upon the threshold of the Royal Academy, which opened its doors with a first exhibition of one hundred and thirty-six pictures!"  
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous pronoun reference in "the cry is 'still they come.'"  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex vocabulary that may hinder clarity for modern readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in long sentences, reducing readability.  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "If wisdom at one entrance was nearly shut out, there was plenty left, as may be gathered from a study of the Discourses."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different events and themes (e.g., Reynolds' career, personal life, and artistic output) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some sentences introduce ideas that are not fully explained or resolved (e.g., the mention of Reynolds' indifference to Hals' paintings).  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the hearing that passed in the old days of the pilgrimage to Rome" is vague and lacks context.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Reynolds' personal life and broader historical or artistic context.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Reynolds' declining portrait output and his social status is not clearly established.
