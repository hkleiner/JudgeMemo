Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He is said to have remarked when quite a lad, and this is but one of the simple sentences that hold and in a sense reveal the keynote of his character."  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistency in "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise his own limitations..." (British vs. American English, but not an error).  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or formal language that may be less accessible to modern readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma in "He is said to have remarked when quite a lad and this is but one of the simple sentences..."  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from Reynolds' early life to his later influence on the Royal Academy without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] Some paragraphs begin with new ideas without sufficient connection to the previous one.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the sentence: "Sir Walter Armstrong thinks that one of his copies of a Rembrandt is classed among the originals in the National Gallery to-day!" (unclear if the copy is mistaken for an original).  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between Reynolds' early life and his time in Italy.  
- [LOGIC] Slight inconsistency in the claim that Reynolds was not a "free liver" when the text later mentions "pleasures of the table" and Dr. Johnson's comment.
