Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He has not learned the secrets of permanent colouring, and some of his most brilliant glazes are beginning to fade before the eyes of the troubled owners of the pictures." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "He has surrendered to the pseudo-classicism of his age, and some of his compositions are absurdly indebted to mythology" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "He has found time to enjoy the pursuits of a country gentleman; he shoots and hunts in the best sporting circles." (awkward transition)  
- [LEXICON] "He keeps a liberal but ill-served table, and his friends will find a welcome if they call in time for dinner at five o'clock, even if they must scramble for a fair share of the meal." (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He has pupils, for whom he does little or nothing, and assistants who paint draperies for him, and receive a little useful instruction now and again." (awkward structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Reynolds' artistic achievements to his personal life and social habits is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between Reynolds' artistic legacy, his personal relationships, and his biographers' interpretations without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The discussion of Reynolds' deafness and its implications is unclear and lacks a logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Reynolds' personal life to the discussion of Angelica Kaufmann and Goethe is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph's focus on biographers' attitudes toward Reynolds' personal life is disconnected from the broader narrative of his artistic contributions.
