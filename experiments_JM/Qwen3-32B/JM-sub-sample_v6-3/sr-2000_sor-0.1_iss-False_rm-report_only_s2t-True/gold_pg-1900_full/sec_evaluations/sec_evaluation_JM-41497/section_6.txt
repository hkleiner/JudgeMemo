Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "had produced in the world of art something akin to a sensation" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "We have but to turn to the work of his great contemporaries, Gainsborough and Romney, to see the difference between women in whose veins the blood runs red, and women who feed on nectar and ambrosia and were never seen at a disadvantage in their lives." (long and complex sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "folk in whom he had no abiding interest" (somewhat archaic or unclear phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He seemed to see right into the heart and brain of the men who sat for him, to realise clearly and judiciously the part they were playing in life, and he strove to set it down in such a fashion that the character and capacities of the sitter should impress themselves at once upon those who saw the portrait." (overuse of commas in long sentence)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It is not always easy to realise what Reynolds' work was like at its best, because so many of his canvases have either lost their original tints or have suffered the final indignity of restoration." (sudden shift in focus from character to technical aspects of paintings)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions from Reynolds' portraits of men to the degradation of his paintings' colors without clear connection  
- [CLARITY] "There was a finality about the treatment that must have baffled and exasperated his rivals." (vague reference to "treatment")  
- [TRANSITION] "Here there is perhaps some excuse for looking at Reynolds' work from the literary standpoint, because though the harmony of line may remain, the harmony of colour has gone beyond recall..." (sudden shift to discussing color degradation without clear transition)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
