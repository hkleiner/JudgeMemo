1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is this passion for veracity unknown among other peoples--is even Washington's story told without gloss?--that gives false colour to the legend of Israel's ancient savagery." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "But in national legends this universal process is sophisticated." (vague and incomplete thought)  
- [SPELLING] "the Ã†neid told the all-invading Roman, putting of course the contemporary ideal backwards--as all missons are put--and into the prophetic mouth of Jove:--" (misspelling of "missions")  
- [SYNTAX] "I have been at pains to examine the literature of the German Synagogue, which if Germanism were Judiasm, ought to show a double dose of original sin." (awkward phrasing and unclear logic)  
- [SPELLING] "But if in Germany a voice of criticism breaks the chorus of self-adoration, it is usually from a Jew like Maximilian Harden, for Jews, as Ambassador Gerard testifies, represent almost the only real culture in Germany." (repetition and awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "So that, when moreover we remember that the noblest and most practical treatise on 'Perpetual Peace' came from that other German professor, Kant, the hope is not altogether ausgechlossen that in the internal convulsion that must follow the war, there may be an upheaval of that finer Germanism of which we should be only too proud to say that it is Judaism." (long and convoluted sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "the hope is not altogether ausgechlossen" (foreign word used without explanation)  
- [SYNTAX] "And Mr. Chesterton has just written a 'History of England' in the very spirit of a Micah flagellating the classes 'who loved fields and seized them.'" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "But so far from finding any swagger of a Chosen People, whether Jewish or German, I find in its most popular work--Lazarus's 'Soziale Ethik im Judentum'--published as late as November, 1913, by the League of German Jews--a grave indictment of militarism." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "For the venerable philosopher, while justly explaining the glamour of the army by its subordination of the individual to the communal weal, yet pointed out emphatically that what unites individuals separates nations." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different historical and philosophical references without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section lacks a clear progression of ideas, making it difficult to follow the author's argument.  
- [CLARITY] The author references many historical and religious figures and texts without sufficient context for a general reader.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing German literature to Lincoln's views on religion is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The argument about Judaism's potential for universalism is presented without sufficient development or support.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different themes (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, German culture) without a clear unifying thread.  
- [CLARITY] The use of foreign terms like "ausgechlossen" and "Bhiksu" without explanation hinders understanding.  
- [LOGIC] The author makes sweeping generalizations about different cultures and religions without providing evidence.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section ends with a philosophical reflection that seems disconnected from the earlier arguments.  
- [CLARITY] The author's tone and style are inconsistent, shifting between academic, poetic, and polemical without clear purpose.
