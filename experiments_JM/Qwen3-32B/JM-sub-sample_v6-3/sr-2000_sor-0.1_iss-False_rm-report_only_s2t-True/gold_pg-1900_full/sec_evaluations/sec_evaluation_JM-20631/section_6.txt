Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In 1600 the East India Company is formed" (should be "was formed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "In 1606 is founded the British colony of Virginia" (awkward phrasing; should be "the British colony of Virginia was founded")  
- [GRAMMAR] "In 1620 New England" (incomplete sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "Delenda est Carthago" is Latin and not an issue, but the context may confuse some readers  
- [SYNTAX] "We do not need Carlyle's warning that he was not a hypocrite" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Does not Marvell, lamenting his death, record in words curiously like Bismarck's that his deceased hero..." (awkward and complex sentence structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "But you have only to remember that Seeley's famous book was written expressly to persuade the England of 1883 not to give up India and the Colonies..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The purification of England which the Methodist movement began and which manifested itself, among other things, in sweeping away the slave-trade, necessitated a less crude formula..." (long and complex sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "The very Ambassador from Germany, Prince Lichnowsky, agrees with Rhodes that the salvation of mankind lies in British imperialism." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "But note how the less spiritual factors are ignored, how the prophet presents his people as a nation of pioneer martyrs..." (awkward phrasing)

- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression or organization, making it difficult to follow the author's main argument  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are ambiguous or unclear, such as "the less spiritual factors are ignored"  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the trail of light from the stern of a vessel gives the illusion that it has come by a shining road" is not clearly explained  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Covenant of Israel" is introduced but not clearly connected to the British mission
