Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after quotation marks and inconsistent use of em dashes. - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He is not deaf to-day, he is only dumb." - [SPELLING] "to-day" is an archaic spelling that may be distracting. - [LEXICON] Some archaic or overly formal word choices may hinder modern readability. - [SYNTAX] Awkward sentence structure in "But the time has come when they must fight as Jews--fight that 'mental fight'..."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Jewish identity to a detailed biography of Arthur Davis with little transition. - [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from a thematic discussion to a eulogy, making the overall structure disjointed. - [TRANSITION] No clear connection between the first section and the "Afterword" section, which feels like a separate text. - [CLARITY] The purpose of the "Afterword" is unclear in relation to the preceding content. - [LOGIC] The thematic focus is lost in the biographical details of Arthur Davis.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
