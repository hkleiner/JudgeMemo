Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Law was only given to Israel because he was so peculiarly fierce he needed curbing." (inconsistent pronoun reference "he")  
- [GRAMMAR] "it is the very argument as to the need for Christ..." (missing preposition; should be "it is the very same argument")  
- [GRAMMAR] "No evidence of the universalism of Israel's mission can away with the fact..." (awkward phrasing; "can away with" is unidiomatic)  
- [GRAMMAR] "broidering itself with an Oriental exuberance..." (likely a misspelling of "brooding" or "embroidering")  
- [GRAMMAR] "were Israel--per impossibile--to disappear." (awkward use of "per impossibile" without explanation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is a mysticism not without affinity to Mr. Wells's." (awkward phrasing; missing preposition or article)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Do not imagine he referred to the heart as a pump..." (awkward phrasing; unclear antecedent for "he")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The wind of creation and inspiration bloweth where it listeth." (archaic phrasing may be intentional, but inconsistent with modern tone)  
- [GRAMMAR] "history is the sole clue to the Bible--history, which according to Bacon..." (repetition of "history")  
- [GRAMMAR] "This happy breed of men, this little world..." (awkward repetition of "this")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Jewish mysticism to English national self-consciousness without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from discussing the "Sinaitic Covenant" to modern American and English national identity without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] Unclear how the quote from Tennyson relates to the preceding discussion of Jewish election  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Mr. Balfour" and "Mr. Wells" lacks sufficient context for a general reader  
- [LOGIC] The transition to discussing "The Melting Pot" and American mission feels abrupt and disconnected from the previous section  
- [LOGIC] The quote from Shakespeare about England is inserted without clear relevance to the surrounding text  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Rule, Britannia" is included without clear connection to the main argument  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between different historical and cultural examples (Jewish, American, English) without clear organization or thematic unity  
- [STRUCTURE] The chapter structure is unclear; the text appears to be a collection of loosely connected historical observations  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "per impossibile" is used without explanation, potentially confusing readers
