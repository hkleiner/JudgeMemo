1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the highest ethical note ever yet sounded"  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "it is precisely in the Old Testament that is reached"  
- [SPELLING] "CÃ¦sar" is an archaic spelling that may be distracting to some readers  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex vocabulary ("consecrated," "transgressed," "cosseted") that may hinder clarity  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase in "But in no other nation known to history has the balance of motives been cast..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the Old Testament to a specific historical anecdote about Pontius Pilate without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between abstract philosophical ideas, historical anecdotes, and literary analysis without clear organization  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the Pilate story to a discussion of Old Testament metaphors without connecting the ideas  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about "Israel disappearing" is somewhat vague and lacks clear connection to the preceding content  
- [LOGIC] The text references "the forty-second chapter of Isaiah" but doesn't clearly explain its relevance to the broader argument
