Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "We sat on one of these seats while the dummy was viewed--page by page--twice." (awkward phrasing with excessive dashes)  
- [SYNTAX] "There I was shown a wire evidently written and sent as soon as I had left." (passive voice and unclear structure)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  
- [LEXICON] "He sent me off to catch the afternoon limited so I could reach New York in the morning." ("limited" is archaic and may be confusing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "That is the “Chief”—always stimulating and appreciative!" (dashes used inconsistently with quotation marks)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the Chicago conference to the chronology section is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing Hearst’s reaction to the dummy to a broader reflection on design history feels disjointed.  
- [CLARITY] "I was shown a wire evidently written and sent as soon as I had left." (unclear reference to the wire and its relevance)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition between the chapter "TOWARDS A NEW STYLE" and "TODAY IN 1954" is abrupt and lacks a smooth narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the author’s retirement and the chronology feels like an afterthought, not fully integrated into the narrative.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
