Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In 1915 Mr. Hearst asked me if I could arrange to give him all of my time and art-supervise production of the motion picture serial" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "I returned to Mr. Hearst in an art and typographic assignment including magazines, newspapers, motion pictures and a trip to Europe where commissions were placed with Edmund Dulac, Arthur Rackham and Frank Brangwyn" (run-on sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "Caslon was used for all headings except for Pearson’s which, using a specially-drawn character, were lettered by hand" (subject-verb agreement issue)  
- [SYNTAX] "By substituting the toboggan-cap red for the pea-green background, with the artist’s approval, we obtained a poster effect that dominated the newsstands and achieved an immediate sellout" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I had an appointment for noon of the next day" (incorrect preposition usage)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different projects and time periods without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative flow.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the author’s work at Collier’s and the subsequent work with Hearst is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and lack clarity, such as the description of the layout process for Cosmopolitan.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the section on Collier’s to the "Enter Mr. Hearst" chapter is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The sequence of events in the Hearst projects is not always clearly ordered, making it hard to follow the timeline.
