Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." (awkward punctuation and phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." (awkward and unclear sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "The two jobbers are kicked." (ambiguous and possibly incorrect phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts..." (unclear meaning of "devil" in this context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." (question mark usage is confusing and unnecessary)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the narrator's early work experiences to the description of the print shop's location and conditions, with little transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the narrator's personal development and broader descriptions of the print shop and town, making the flow uneven.  
- [CLARITY] The role of "devil" in the print shop is unclear and could confuse readers unfamiliar with historical printing terminology.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the narrator's work at Iron Ore to the introduction of the Peninsula Record is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of Frank Bromley and the suggestion to visit Chicago feels disconnected from the previous narrative thread.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
