Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Text on electrotypes will be reset in type from Bradley: His Book fonts" is awkwardly phrased and slightly confusing.  
- [SYNTAX] "he dipped into the field of the motion picture as art supervisor of serials for William Randolph Hearst" is grammatically correct but awkward in structure.  
- [LEXICON] "The alluring prospect of additional illustrations for these pages was reluctantly passed by" is awkward and unclear phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "Our physical limitations and resources proved inadequate to reflect the qualities, and the scope and variety of Mr. Bradleyâ€™s work" is a run-on sentence with poor structure.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected, but some phrasing is overly formal or archaic, which may affect readability for some readers.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of Bradley's career to the sources of the book is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the sources is long and dense, making it difficult to follow the logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about Mr. Bradley's involvement in the book is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear narrative thread.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the book's production to the tribute event is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the undersigned reporter" is unclear in context and may confuse the reader about the authorship or editorial process.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
