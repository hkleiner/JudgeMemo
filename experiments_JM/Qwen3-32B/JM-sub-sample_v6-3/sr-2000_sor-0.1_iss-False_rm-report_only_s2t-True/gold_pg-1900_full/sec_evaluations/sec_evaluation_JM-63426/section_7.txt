Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "has has just turned up" (double "has")  
- [SPELLING] "rompers" (likely a typo or incorrect word in context)  
- [SYNTAX] "He said I would be given his office in the editorial department and he would occupy one in the book department, where he could devote more time to that branch of the business, an arrangement he knew would please his father." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [LEXICON] "bully" (archaic or unclear usage in modern context)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "On a Saturday afternoon in 1907, believing myself alone, for the offices and plant had closed at twelve, I was standing at a drafting table..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing the Thanksgiving issue to a reflection on the author’s early understanding of type display and salesmanship, with little transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different time periods and topics (e.g., Collier’s, American Type Founders, early career) without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] "These never-to-be-forgotten lessons, taught by experience and emphasized by the sales results of the publicity campaign I had lately conducted for the American Typefounders Company, would classify that Thanksgiving number as a newsstand disappointment." (confusing sentence structure and logic)  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the anecdote about Mr. Collier to the author’s reflections on salesmanship and design  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about not using popular writers or illustrators is introduced without clear connection to the previous discussion  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
