1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Typography, with nothing to its credit following Colonial times, had reached a low ebb during the Victorian period" – awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "plucking me long before I am ripe, cultivate a lively pair of gypsy heels" – unclear and grammatically problematic.  
- [SPELLING] "æsthetic" – archaic spelling may be distracting to some readers.  
- [LEXICON] "I was inspired by some quickening of interest to make a special trip" – awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "I was allowed to carry volumes to a nearby gallery above the reference room, where, at conveniently arranged lecterns along an iron balustrade, I examined them at my leisure" – overly complex and wordy.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The books were uncatalogued and stacked in fireproof rooms which were called the 'Barton Safes.'" – awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "Using Caslon roman with italic in a merry intermingling of caps and lower case" – awkward and unclear.  
- [GRAMMAR] "This Colonial typography, void of beauty-destroying mechanical precision" – awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "I now become a member of the newly formed Arts and Crafts Society of Boston, possibly a charter member" – awkward phrasing.  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Wayside Press which I opened in this year of transition was so named for a very real reason" – missing comma after "Press."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between historical context, personal anecdotes, and technical details without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is dense and at times meandering, making it difficult to follow the central thread.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and lack clarity, such as the description of the print shop setup.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing the Wayside Press to the anecdote about Mr. Moses is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the historical overview of typography and the author's personal journey is not always clear.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text includes many digressions and tangents that disrupt the flow.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "plucking me long before I am ripe, cultivate a lively pair of gypsy heels" is confusing and lacks clarity.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes shifts between past and present tense without clear indication.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear progression of ideas, with some sections feeling disconnected from the main narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the print shop and its setup is detailed but lacks a clear focus.
