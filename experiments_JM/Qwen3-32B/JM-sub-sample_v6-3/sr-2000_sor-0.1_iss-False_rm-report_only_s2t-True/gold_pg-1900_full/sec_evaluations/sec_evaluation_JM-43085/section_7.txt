Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He would have been able, by rummaging there, to clothe from top to toe whole generations of bourgeoise, nobles, and labourers..." (awkward phrasing and missing article before "generations")  
- [SPELLING] "nineteeth" instead of "nineteenth"  
- [SYNTAX] "And we know,--his fine passion for the truth was always cropping out,--that he actually suffered..." (awkward use of em dashes and unclear syntax)  
- [LEXICON] "bourgeoise" is likely a misspelling of "bourgeois" or "bourgeoises"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Meissonier's dedication without clear transitions  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Meissonier's costume collection and his artistic process is implied but not clearly explained  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Gray Redingote" is mentioned without sufficient context for a reader unfamiliar with the subject  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from describing his costume collection to his working methods is abrupt  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
