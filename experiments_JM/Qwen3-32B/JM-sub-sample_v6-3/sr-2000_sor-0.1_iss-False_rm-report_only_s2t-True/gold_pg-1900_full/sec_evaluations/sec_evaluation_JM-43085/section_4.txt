Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had learned to give to every face that profundity, to every scene that intensity of action, that constitutes his individual bigness." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "The arrangement of the milieu, the scrupulous devotion to realism that we noted in the opening lines of this study, the prodigious anxiety to give to every one of his personages such play of physiognomy, such expression, glance, and gesture as would best reveal their character and help us to know them better,--all these things combine and harmonize to produce an effect of remarkable power." (long and complex sentence with poor flow)  
- [LEXICON] "individual bigness" (uncommon and awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas and em dashes in long sentences, disrupting readability  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from a general discussion of Meissonier's artistic development to a detailed description of a specific painting and then to a quote from Gautier, with minimal transitional phrases.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the artist's success and the detailed description of "The Smoker" is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "individual bigness" is unclear and not elaborated upon, making it a confusing concept in the context.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the artist's career to the quote from Gautier is abrupt and lacks a clear logical link.
