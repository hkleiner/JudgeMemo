1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." (awkward phrasing and missing prepositions)  
- [SYNTAX] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." (passive construction weakens clarity)  
- [LEXICON] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." (word choice could be more precise)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" (awkward phrasing and missing conjunction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The first connoisseurs to pay attention to the newcomer were editors, the severe and imposing editors." (repetition and redundancy)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The first instalment of illustrations that he offered to a magazine then famous, the name of which is now forgotten--four little sepia drawings--was curtly rejected." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The publisher, rendered distrustful by so youthful and importunate a face, assured the young man and the friend who had introduced him, that 'for the time being he had nothing for him.'" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The proof of this is that M. Curmer accepted an invitation to go the following Sunday to Meissonier's studio, to sit for his life-mask,--and, once there, it was impossible for him not to order an aquarelle." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The artist still continued to do illustrating. Mention must be made of the drawings that he did for Frenchmen Painted by Themselves, and later--here ends this chapter of his artistic career--the plates that served as illustrations for The Fallen Angel, by Lamartine (edition in two volumes, already unobtainable twenty years ago), and the Contes Rémois, by M. de Chevigné; this last series bears date 1858." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different phases of Meissonier's career without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from one anecdote to another without clear signposting.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and obscure the main point.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about the publisher to the description of the illustrations is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Meissonier's early struggles and his eventual success is not clearly established.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the illustrations and their significance is somewhat confusing.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes circles back to earlier points without clear motivation.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph feels disconnected from the preceding narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Pariah thinking of the English Doctor" and vice versa is confusing without context.  
- [LOGIC] The conclusion of the chapter feels abrupt and lacks a clear summary of Meissonier's achievements.
