Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He profited from it above all in being able to continue to paint."
- [SPELLING] "aquarelle" is spelled inconsistently with "watercolor" terminology.
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome construction in "It is because of this perfect proportion that it has been so justly said that 'Meissonier's pictures never look small excepting before you have really looked at them.'"
- [LEXICON] "brilliant and ingenious special plea" is somewhat vague and imprecise.
- [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of em dash in "But let us make no mistake in this regard. Painting on a small scaleâ€”would not of itself suffice..."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing etchings to paintings without clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The section on "PAINTINGS" begins abruptly without clear connection to the previous section.
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transition between the end of the etching section and the beginning of the painting section.
- [CLARITY] The argument about small-scale paintings is presented but not clearly resolved or connected to the broader narrative.
- [LOGIC] The quote from M. Gustave Larroumet is introduced but not clearly integrated into the main argument.
