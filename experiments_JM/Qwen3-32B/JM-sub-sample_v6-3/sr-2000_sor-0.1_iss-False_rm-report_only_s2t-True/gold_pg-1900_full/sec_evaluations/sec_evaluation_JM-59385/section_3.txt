Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in Peking" (fragmented and unclear structure).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the fragmented line "Wherein there is a departure from family custom and Kuei Ping goes with her husband to live in Peking" (disrupts flow).  
- [LEXICON] Repetition of "wedding" and "veil" in close proximity, though not incorrect, slightly hinders smooth reading.  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in tone and setting at the end with the moonlit courtyard scene, which feels disconnected from the preceding wedding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The fragmented line "Wherein there is a departure from family custom..." disrupts the narrative flow and logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the wedding feast to the moonlit courtyard scene is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about pilgrimages is slightly confusing due to its placement and reference to prior events not clearly established in the current segment.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
