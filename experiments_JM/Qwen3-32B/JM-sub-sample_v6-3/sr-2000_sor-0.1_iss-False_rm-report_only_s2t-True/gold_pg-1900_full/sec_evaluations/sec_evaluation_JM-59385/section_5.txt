Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein shadows throw their length across the tidy courtyard" and "Wherein there is deepening sorrow" (fragmented and poetic style may be intentional but disrupts standard fluency)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the fragmented lines "Wherein shadows throw their length across the tidy courtyard" and "Wherein there is deepening sorrow"
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are archaic or culturally specific (e.g., "chair-bearer," "soothsayer," "Imperial Calendar") which may be stylistic but could be confusing to some readers

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between different narrative moments and emotional tones (e.g., from the child's first steps to the father's illness and death)
- [LOGIC] The connection between the child's first steps and the sudden introduction of war and family conflict is not clearly established
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the child's early life to the father's illness and subsequent opium use is abrupt and lacks clear narrative connection
- [CLARITY] The cultural and religious practices described (e.g., burial rites, use of charms) may be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
