Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia"  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift in tone and structure between the narrative and the poetic lines "Wherein there is a wedding..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or overly formal language ("thou," "thou needest," "thou dost resemble") that may disrupt modern readability  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation in the line "Outside, the chair-bearers, trained to patience by long hours, waited. Wherein there is a wedding..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden transition from the wedding preparation to the poetic lines "Wherein there is a wedding..." disrupts the narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift in time and tone from the wedding scene to the earlier description of the soothsayers and the engagement process  
- [CLARITY] The line "Wherein there is a wedding and Kuei Ping becomes a member of the family of Chia" is unclear and feels like a summary rather than a narrative continuation  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between detailed descriptions of the wedding and the earlier engagement process without clear transitions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
