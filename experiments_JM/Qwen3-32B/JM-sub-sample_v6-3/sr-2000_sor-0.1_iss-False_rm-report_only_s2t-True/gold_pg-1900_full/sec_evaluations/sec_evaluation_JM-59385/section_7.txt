Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Wherein there is patience and tenderness and understanding and a return to a little home village" lacks proper punctuation and formatting.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Wherein twenty-seven slow years are added one upon another" lacks proper punctuation and formatting.  
- [SYNTAX] "She read, too, in the repeated calls from his household for their return more than just the desire to enforce old traditions." Awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "She felt something of the weight of the household burdens upon the tired shoulders of Madame Chia..." Awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "She saw thus now because she measured their love not by her need of him, but by his need of her." Awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "The second of the new years within the compound gave to Kuei Ping a baby girl." Awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "The long days that followed bore their pain of loneliness." Awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "Stilling his cries and lulling to sleep the little daughter, Kuei Ping felt herself to blame that she had wanted freedom and perhaps had bought it with Fuh Tangâ€™s life." Awkward phrasing.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's internal reflections to the procession and then to the years that follow, with minimal transitional cues.  
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "Wherein..." lines interrupts the narrative flow and creates a disjointed reading experience.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the festival scene to the years of Kuei Ping's life is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative bridge.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the joyful return to the compound to the death of Fuh Tang is sudden and lacks sufficient foreshadowing or emotional buildup.  
- [LOGIC] The final lines about the years melting together and the death of Fuh Tang feel rushed and lack the emotional depth expected from the preceding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The text references events and characters (e.g., Madame Yen, Madame Chia) without sufficient context for a reader encountering this section independently.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
