Evaluation Form:

- [PUNCTUATION] Missing punctuation after "born" in the line "Wherein a son is born and there is great rejoicing"  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or overly formal language that may confuse modern readers  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in phrases like "the crown of womanhood was the bearing of a son"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in tone and focus from the couple's struggle with tradition to the birth of their child without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The ending abruptly shifts to a description of the child's birth and the following months, which feels disconnected from the earlier narrative of their escape from the compound  
- [CLARITY] Some phrases are vague or ambiguous, such as "Carried by the devious ways of tongue and ear"  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the couple's life after leaving the compound and the birth of their child
