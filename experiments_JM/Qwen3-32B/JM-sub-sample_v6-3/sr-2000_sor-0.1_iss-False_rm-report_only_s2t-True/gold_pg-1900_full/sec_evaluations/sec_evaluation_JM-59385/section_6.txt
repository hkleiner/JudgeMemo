- [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts abruptly from Kuei Ping's internal struggles to descriptions of the sunrise and city life without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift from Kuei Ping's despair to her newfound spiritual understanding feels somewhat abrupt and under-explained.
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "the poison of the poppy stilled into pleasantness the dreams" is somewhat unclear.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat disjointed structure with multiple narrative threads that could be better connected.
