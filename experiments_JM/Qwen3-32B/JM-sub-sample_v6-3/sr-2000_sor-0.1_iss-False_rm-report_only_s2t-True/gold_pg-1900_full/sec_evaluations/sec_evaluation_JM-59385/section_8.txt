Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The affairs of government rocked above her head." (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "The fatty places in which they had squeezed more than twice their earnings taken away" (confusing structure)
- [SPELLING] "luminate" (should be "illuminate")
- [SYNTAX] "The plan grew more rapidly than she could well manage alone." (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "She found two rooms in a section of a courtyard near enough to the mission school for her daughter to attend classes with other girls of her own age." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Kuei Ping's story to the narrator's experience as a student with little transition
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about the narrator feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative about Kuei Ping
- [CLARITY] The final lines "Wherein the narrator becomes Kuei Pingâ€™s pupil and is filled with wondering questions and is witness to a dream come true in its threefold parts" are confusing and don't clearly connect to the preceding text
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Kuei Ping's story to the narrator's experience is abrupt and lacks clear connection
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new perspective (the narrator) that wasn't established in the previous text

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
