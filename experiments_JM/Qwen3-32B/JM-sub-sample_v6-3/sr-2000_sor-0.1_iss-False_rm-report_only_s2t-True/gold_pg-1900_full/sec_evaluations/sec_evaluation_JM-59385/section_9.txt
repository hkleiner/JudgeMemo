- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing temples to the school and church without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "the counting board" and its legend  
- [STRUCTURE] Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple ideas, making the flow less smooth  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of temples to the school and its significance  
- [LOGIC] The final sentence about "the voice of the Father who gave his Son" is somewhat disconnected from the preceding context
