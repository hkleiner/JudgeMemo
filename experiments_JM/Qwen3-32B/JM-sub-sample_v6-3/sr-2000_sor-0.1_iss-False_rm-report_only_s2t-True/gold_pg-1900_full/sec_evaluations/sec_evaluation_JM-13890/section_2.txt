Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "was completely heathen, saving only the King's Frankish wife Bertha and Bishop Luidhard" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Augustine, landed--if Bede may be trusted for a topographical detail of this character--on the island of Ebbsfleet" (awkward interruption in sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [LEXICON] "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" (overly poetic phrasing that may confuse readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Bishop Luidhard, whose name should always be linked with that of St. Augustine, appears to have died soon after the arrival of Pope Gregory's mission" (overuse of commas creates a run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome and to shake itself free from monasticism and the various forms of idolatrous worship which grew up in the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church" (long and complex sentence with unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the organization of the churches holding to the Elizabethan form of worship will no doubt continue to be centred and focussed at Canterbury" (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SPELLING] "archÃ¦ologists" (encoding error)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It seems unlikely that the influence of the queen and her good chaplain should have been entirely without results" (assumes prior knowledge of the queen's influence without sufficient context)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple historical events and locations without clear transitions (e.g., from Ethelbert to Augustine to St. Martin's to the Danes).  
- [CLARITY] "the fabric of the little building does not conclusively prove that it is even in part the actual church of this fascinating period" (vague and ambiguous phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "Perhaps the problem will be solved by further discoveries, but until then it seems wiser to regard St. Martin's as being in part a very early Saxon building" (sudden shift in focus without clear connection to previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "It was not finished when, in 605, Augustine died, and eventually the dedication included the canonized first archbishop of the English Church, who was buried in the building when it was finished" (confusing sequence of events)  
- [CLARITY] "There are other traces of Saxon work in the church of St. Mildred near the castle, but this is much later than anything that has been discovered on the other sites" (lack of clear connection to the main narrative)  
- [LOGIC] "Canterbury appears to have grown and prospered in spite of various attacks made by the Danes until the year 1011" (sudden shift in time and focus without clear transition)
