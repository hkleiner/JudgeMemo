Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The remains of the buildings of the Black, or Preaching, Friars, and those of the Grey Friars, who belonged to the rule of St. Francis, are on islands formed by the Stour" (awkward phrasing and comma usage)  
- [SYNTAX] "it is never possible to see it" (repetition of "it" is slightly confusing)  
- [LEXICON] "one must be content with the picturesque brick gateway of the Roper house in St. Dunstan's Street" (wording is slightly awkward)  

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] The transition between the description of hospitals and churches is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the only one lacking in interest is All Saints' in High Street" is introduced without clear connection to the previous paragraph.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the head of Sir Thomas More" is mentioned without prior context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
