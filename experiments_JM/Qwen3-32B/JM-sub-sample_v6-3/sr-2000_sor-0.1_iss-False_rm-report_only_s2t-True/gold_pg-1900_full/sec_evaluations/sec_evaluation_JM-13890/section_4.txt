Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Taking up such an attitude in front of four men who had come hot-foot to Canterbury with the express determination to seek an excuse for killing him, Becket was sealing his own fate." (Awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The fear of sacrilege induced the knights to try to drag the defenceless Archbishop out of the Cathedral, but he struggled with such vigour, flinging one of the men down on the stone floor, that they gave up the attempt and killed him with three or four sword strokes, the last of which, as he lay prone, was delivered by Richard le Bret, or the Breton, and so tremendous was the force with which it was delivered that the crown of the head was severed from the skull and the sword broke in two on the pavement." (Cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate with the practices of medieval monasticism." (Word choice is awkward and unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Such austerity had hitherto been unknown to English saints, and the marvel was increased by the sight--to our notions so revolting--of the innumerable vermin with which the hair-cloth abounded--boiling over with them, as one account describes it, like water in a simmering cauldron." (Overuse of em dashes disrupts flow)  
- [SPELLING] "defenceless" (British spelling is consistent, but may be considered a minor issue in American English contexts)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate with the practices of medieval monasticism." (Sudden shift in narrative voice and unclear relevance to the main story)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps abruptly from the murder of Becket to the monks' reaction and then to the relic trade, with minimal transitional phrases.  
- [CLARITY] "Roger had been specially chosen to guard this relic, but he succumbed to the temptation offered by the rival establishment outside the city walls, and having purloined the coveted fragment of the martyr, was duly installed in the highest office of St. Augustine's." (Confusing sentence structure and unclear cause-effect relationship)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the murder to the canonization of Becket is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative bridge.  
- [LOGIC] "It is almost incredible how rapidly Becket became St. Thomas of Canterbury." (This statement is vague and lacks supporting context for the reader to understand the timeline or process of canonization)
