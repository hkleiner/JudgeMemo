1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Henry was now quite absolved, but he remained for the whole night with his bare feet still muddy and in the same penitential garb." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "he recovered rapidly, believing implicitly, after the manner of his age, that this success was attributable to the penance he had undergone on the day before the battle." (cumbersome structure)  
- [LEXICON] "the little Norman city" (vague reference without clear antecedent)  
- [SPELLING] "the martyr mixed with water was distributed" (missing article "the")  
- [SYNTAX] "The fire came, however, and the choir was to a great extent rebuilt, but fortunately the chapels were only slightly affected." (awkward transition)  
- [GRAMMAR] "To one or both of these architects is due the unusual device..." (passive voice with unclear subject)  
- [SYNTAX] "the Gothic style was just beginning to appear--an incipient tendency..." (long sentence with unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the martyrdom took place on December 29, but owing to the time of the year this festival did not draw so many as the summer one." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "the city could afford to present Queen Elizabeth with Â£30 in a scented purse" (encoding issue with "Â£")  
- [SYNTAX] "To touch even lightly on the subsequent history of Canterbury is not possible here..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Henry's penance to the description of Canterbury's cathedral and its history is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between historical events and architectural descriptions without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the martyr" in "the little leaden bottle in which the infinitely diluted blood of the martyr mixed with water was distributed" is unclear without context.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the fire and rebuilding of the cathedral to the description of the city's streets and buildings is jarring.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the dissolution of monasteries and the city's continued importance is not clearly explained.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Dr. Cox" and his book is introduced abruptly and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the cathedral's beauty and the city's modern streets lacks a clear connection to the preceding historical narrative.
