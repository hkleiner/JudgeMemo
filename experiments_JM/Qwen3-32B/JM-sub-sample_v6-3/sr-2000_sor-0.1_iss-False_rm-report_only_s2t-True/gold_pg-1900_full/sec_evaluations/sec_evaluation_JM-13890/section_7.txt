1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The effect of emptiness existing to-day is vastly different to what the pilgrims used to gaze upon..." (awkward phrasing and incorrect preposition "to" instead of "from")  
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (incorrect character encoding)  
- [SYNTAX] "All this barbarous crowding of colour and ornament, all this splendour of a ritual that appealed to an age capable of stilling the voice of conscience with an absolution obtainable for a few pence has passed away..." (run-on sentence with poor structure)  
- [LEXICON] "Dean Farrar, who is buried in the great cloister, and William Broughton, Bishop of Sydney and Adelaide, who was a scholar at the King's School." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The arcades of alternately circular and octagonal pillars have richly carved foliated capitals, and there is a lightness in form and a profusion of carving that tells of the coming of the Gothic style..." (awkward and overly complex sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "CrÃ©cy" (encoding error)  
- [GRAMMAR] "To the west is a fine thirteenth-century mosaic pavement similar to that in the Confessor's Chapel at Westminster Abbey, to which it is very fitting to compare this chapel..." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "The strong iron railing has prevented any damage to the bronze or latten effigy, and except for the tarnishing and general deterioration of gilding and paint, one looks on the monument as it was erected in the days of chivalry." (awkward and unclear phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from historical descriptions to modern reflections without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative lacks a clear progression, with multiple unrelated details presented in a disjointed manner.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and difficult to follow, such as the one about the Reform Bill and Archbishop Howley.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from descriptions of architectural features to historical anecdotes is abrupt and lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the description of the shrine and the mention of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" is not clearly explained.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text includes many isolated details about monuments and historical figures without a clear unifying theme or narrative thread.
