1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the Archbishop sate" (archaic spelling inconsistent with modern standard)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Becket had just finished dinner, and was seated on his couch talking to his friends when the four knights were announced, and he pointedly continued, his conversation with the monk who sat by him and on whose shoulder he was leaning." (awkward phrasing and comma splice)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the conspirators continued to look mutely at each other, till Fitzurse, who throughout took the lead, replied with a scornful expression," (awkward phrasing and inconsistent tense usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The conspirators continued to look mutely at each other, till Fitzurse, who throughout took the lead, replied with a scornful expression," (repetition of "conspirators" and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The doorkeeper ran up and kept the door ajar, that they might see from the outside what was going on." (awkward phrasing and archaic construction)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Becket's face grew crimson, and he glanced round at their countenances, which seemed to gather fire from Fitzurse's speech." (awkward phrasing and vague reference)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The complaints--which are given by the various chroniclers in very different words--were three in number." (awkward phrasing and unnecessary em dashes)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from the historical development of the cathedral to the murder of Becket without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The detailed account of the murder scene is inserted without clear connection to the preceding historical narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The dialogue between Becket and the knights is presented in a fragmented manner, making it difficult to follow the flow of the conversation.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to "Dean Stanley's 'Historical Memorials of Canterbury'" interrupts the narrative flow and is not clearly integrated.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of the day of the week (Tuesday) and its significance is introduced abruptly and not clearly explained.  
- [LOGIC] The reference to the cross-staff as a potential weapon is introduced without prior context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the knights' complaints to Becket's responses is abrupt and lacks clarity.
