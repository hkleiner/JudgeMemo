- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous structure in "The command to build the new city had not long been issued, and the place was still altogether unfinished."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex vocabulary that may hinder clarity for some readers (e.g., "preciosity," "suzerain," "bedaw√¨n").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some complex sentences.  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "The official world promptly broke with the old religion. The king altered his throne-name..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from religious reform to administrative and political details without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from the religious context to the political and military affairs of the vassal states.  
- [CLARITY] Some references are unclear without prior knowledge (e.g., "Yanhamu," "Amanappa," "Rib-Addi of Gebal").  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth transitions between the religious reform and the description of the new capital and its officials.
