2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the golden images to the characters of the monarchs without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different narrative threads (e.g., from the golden images to the characters of Tushratta and Napkhuria) without clear signposting  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the golden images and the broader diplomatic context is not always clear  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the letter to Teye to the analysis of the characters of the monarchs  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new analytical perspective (on the characters of the monarchs) without clearly linking it to the preceding narrative  
- [STRUCTURE] The section ends with a heading "IV. LETTERS FROM ASIATIC VASSALS" that appears out of context and is not explained in the preceding text
