Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Of a certain land of Danuna (considered a part of Canaan) we learn further that its king died..." (awkward phrasing and missing article)  
- [SYNTAX] "One of the two may be identical with the king of Tana; who, as Rib-Addi briefly mentions, was about to march to Gebal..." (missing comma after "Tana")  
- [SPELLING] "Evidently he meant to enumerate superciliously petty foreign 'princesses' only." (awkward phrasing and unclear use of "superciliously")  
- [LEXICON] "It is a pity that this dainty little letter is for the most part illegible." (somewhat informal tone in an otherwise formal text)  
- [SYNTAX] "However favourably the religious reform of King Napkhuria may be estimated on its own merits..." (missing "favourably" is British English, but may be confusing for some readers)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "However favourably the religious reform of King Napkhuria may be estimated on its own merits, it by no means strengthened the authority of Egypt in Asia." (sudden shift from the previous section to a new topic with little transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different topics (letters, political conditions, Mitani, Hittites) without clear transitions or organization.  
- [CLARITY] "The name 'Hanirabbat' by which it was known to all its neighbours, must be the older name..." (confusing sentence structure and unclear reference to "it")  
- [TRANSITION] "But still more swiftly overtaken of fate was the XVIIIth Dynasty in Egypt." (awkward phrasing and poor transition from the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "They must already have been on the march when in a happy moment it occurred to a keeper of the royal archives..." (sudden shift in narrative perspective and unclear connection to the previous sentence)
