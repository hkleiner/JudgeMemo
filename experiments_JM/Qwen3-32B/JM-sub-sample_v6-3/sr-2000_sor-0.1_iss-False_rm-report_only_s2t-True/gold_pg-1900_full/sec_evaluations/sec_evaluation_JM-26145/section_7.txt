Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He lost his territory, kept up the struggle a little longer as a freebooter, was taken captive at Megiddo, escaped again on the eve of being shipped to Egypt, and fell in battle or died a natural death after at length meeting apparently with some success in Judæa."  
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spelling "Judæa" may be distracting.  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or obscure terms like "Uweu," "rabisu," and "Pidati" may hinder fluency for general readers.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some quoted passages.  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "Their voices take up the chorus of complaint: ABDIKHEBA. ‘Lo! Milki-El and Tagi have done as follows.... Thus, as the king liveth, hath Milki-El committed treachery against me.’"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Labaya’s story to Jerusalem and Abdikheba without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple characters and locations (e.g., Labaya, Abdikheba, Milki-El, Tagi, Abi-milki) without clear narrative thread.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between the Egyptian system of government and the various conflicts is not clearly explained.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of Labaya to the detailed letters of Abdikheba and others.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Adad-nirari and the illegible name lacks clear connection to the preceding content.
