- [STRUCTURE] The text is dense and jumps between multiple characters and events without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Some cause-effect relationships are unclear or implied rather than explicitly stated.  
- [CLARITY] The narrative is complex and may be difficult to follow without prior context.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between different vassals and their letters disrupt the flow.
