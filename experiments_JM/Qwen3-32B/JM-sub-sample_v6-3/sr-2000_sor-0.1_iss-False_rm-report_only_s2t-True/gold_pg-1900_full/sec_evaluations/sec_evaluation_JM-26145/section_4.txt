Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "difficulties to contend against" (awkward phrasing; should be "difficulties to contend with")  
- [SYNTAX] "a faithful account is sent to Egypt" (passive voice weakens clarity; could be rephrased for better flow)  
- [SPELLING] "Nimmuria indeed, seems to have had a weakness..." (misplaced comma)  
- [SYNTAX] "the language is that of Hanirabbat and this we are still unable to read" (awkward phrasing; could be clearer)  
- [SPELLING] "Nimmuria felt his end approaching, and entreated the aid of 'Our Lady of Nineveh.'" (missing comma after "Nineveh")  
- [SYNTAX] "He gives one the impression of an inexperienced prince, brought up in Oriental seclusion, who persists at all hazards in playing the part of a shrewd and worldly-wise ruler." (cumbersome and wordy)  
- [SPELLING] "Napkhuria" (inconsistent capitalization; should be "Napkhuria" or "Akhenaten" consistently)  
- [SYNTAX] "He strained after novelty at the expense of his own security, and attempted to demonstrate the strength of the supports of his throne by sawing them through." (awkward phrasing; "sawing them through" is unclear)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Tushratta’s letters to Nimmuria’s death and Tushratta’s grief without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different historical figures and events without clear signposting or logical flow  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the last letter" is unclear without prior context  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Tushratta to Napkhuria (Akhenaten) is abrupt and lacks explanation of the connection  
- [LOGIC] The connection between Napkhuria’s actions and the Babylonian response is not clearly explained  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the Assyrians, my vassals" is confusing without prior context of their relationship to Babylonia
