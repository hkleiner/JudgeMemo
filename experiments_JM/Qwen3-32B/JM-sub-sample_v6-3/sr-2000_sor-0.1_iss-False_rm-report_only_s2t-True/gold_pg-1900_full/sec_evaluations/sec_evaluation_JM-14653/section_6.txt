Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "the person will ever be quite 'done,' human nature..." (missing punctuation and incomplete sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "the person will ever be quite 'done,' human nature, still being human..." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SPELLING] "deficiences" (incorrect spelling; should be "deficiencies")  
- [SYNTAX] "the first object of my attentions. I can then regard that person as 'done.' I can put him on a shelf..." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [SYNTAX] "and I can stare at them in a row on the person will ever be quite 'done,'..." (run-on sentence and missing punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "the person will ever be quite 'done,' human nature, still being human..." (sudden shift in subject and unclear connection to previous ideas)  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the discussion of goodwill to the metaphor of learning languages is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "the person will ever be quite 'done,' human nature, still being human..." (confusing phrasing that disrupts the logical flow)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the metaphor of language learning to the concept of goodwill is not clearly explained or connected.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the "ambitious and resolute man" is somewhat disjointed from the main argument about goodwill and lacks a clear link to the previous section.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
