Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "you would change everything" lacks parallel structure with previous clause. - [SYNTAX] "You would in fact achieve perfection" has awkward phrasing. - [LEXICON] "You can see instantly how amusing it would be" uses "amusing" in a context that seems contradictory to the author's point. - [SYNTAX] "The perfect can merely expire" has awkward phrasing. - [GRAMMAR] "He reaches his ambition, and retires from the fight in order to enjoy life,--and what does he then do?" has inconsistent punctuation. - [SYNTAX] "The proportion of men who, having established an equilibrium, proceed to die on the spot, is enormous" has awkward phrasing. - [GRAMMAR] "Happiness as it is dreamed of cannot possibly exist save for brief periods of self-deception which are followed by terrible periods of reaction" has awkward phrasing. - [SYNTAX] "Real happiness lives in patience, having comprehended that if very little is accomplished towards perfection, so a man's existence is a very little moment in the vast expanse of the universal life" has awkward phrasing and structure.

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the concept of Evil to the hypothetical perfect world is abrupt. - [STRUCTURE] The shift from philosophical discussion to the "average successful man" feels disconnected. - [CLARITY] The concept of "the golden moments of life" is introduced without clear connection to previous arguments. - [TRANSITION] The final paragraph about Christmas and "the Feast of St. Friend" feels like an abrupt conclusion with little connection to the preceding philosophical discussion. - [LOGIC] The argument about happiness being an inward state of mind is introduced without sufficient development of the previous points. - [STRUCTURE] The text moves between abstract philosophical concepts and specific examples without clear transitions.
