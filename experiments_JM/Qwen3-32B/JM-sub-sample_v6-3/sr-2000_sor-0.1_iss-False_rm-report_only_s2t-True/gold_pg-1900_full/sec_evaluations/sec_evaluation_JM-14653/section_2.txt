Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "They were written by devotees. And this age could not have produced them." (awkward phrasing and lack of transition between sentences)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was as if people had said: 'We don't know what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and then we shall feel safer.'" (awkward syntax and inconsistent quotation formatting)  
- [LEXICON] "They would leave naught alone" (archaic phrasing that may confuse modern readers)  
- [SPELLING] "ebullition" (correct spelling, but used in a context that may be unclear)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "And there came a moment after which nobody could ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way." (long sentence with unclear punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "An age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain persons have pretended the contrary." (sudden shift in tone and unclear reference to "certain persons")  
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from discussing Christmas to the solstice and then to scientific knowledge is abrupt and lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] "The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the realm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a land subject to earthquakes." (confusing metaphor and unclear meaning)  
- [TRANSITION] "But the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know it." (sudden shift in tone and argument without clear transition)  
- [LOGIC] "We can explain the solstice. We are aware with absolute certitude..." (sudden shift from philosophical reflection to scientific explanation without clear connection)
