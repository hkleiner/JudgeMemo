Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must place her tam at just the right jaunty angle on her curly yellow hair; her ribbons must be made into just the proper bows; her tall boots neatly laced; her gloves and muff were always in the right place..." (inconsistent verb tenses: "must be made" vs. "were always in")  
- [SYNTAX] "The boys teased her, and called her the 'Ladies' Fashion Page,' but you know what boys are, and after all her little vanities were quite harmless." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Janet and Marjorie had arrived in Edinburgh, and one of the first of the pleasures was a walk around the city to see the sights, as Don expressed it." (awkward phrasing and unnecessary comma)  
- [LEXICON] "You must place her tam at just the right jaunty angle..." (repetitive phrasing and overly descriptive, slightly verbose)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing Janet and Marjorie's preparation for a walk to a general commentary on boys and their teasing, with no clear connection to the main narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Janet and Marjorie feels disconnected from the preceding narrative about Donald and Sandy, with no clear transition or context.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "but you know what boys are, and after all her little vanities were quite harmless" is vague and does not clearly connect to the previous sentence.  
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph ends abruptly with "Janet was quite her opposite," without elaboration or continuation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
