Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Don was gotten up as 'Rob Roy'" (awkward phrasing; "gotten up" is non-standard)  
- [GRAMMAR] "which got in his way most of the time" (missing comma after "claymore")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The children had barely time to exhibit themselves before the company began to come" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a number of their little neighbours from roundabout" (awkward phrasing; "roundabout" is vague)  
- [GRAMMAR] "much after the style of 'Dropping the Handkerchief'" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "This, as you may suppose, is a game which usually ends in a great romp" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "with a big cake in front of Marjorie's plate, with ten candles stuck in it, all alight, one for each year of her age" (repetition and awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "how everybody applauded!" (exclamation mark is unnecessary and disrupts tone)  
- [GRAMMAR] "what we call the 'Virginia Reel'" (awkward phrasing; "what we call" is redundant)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the midst of it all in walked the little 'tewky'" (awkward phrasing; "in walked" is stylistically inconsistent)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Don tripped over his claymore and fell against Sandy, while Sandy's gilt crown went rolling down the hall" (awkward phrasing; could be clearer)  
- [GRAMMAR] "One morning a shrill whistle brought Sandy to his garden wall" (awkward phrasing; "brought" is unclear in this context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "What was it all about?" (awkward phrasing; could be more natural)  
- [GRAMMAR] "On one occasion Don came home after the fray with a big bump on the side of his head which had frightened his mother" (awkward phrasing; could be clearer)  
- [GRAMMAR] "For this he was quite a hero in the eyes of his playmates" (awkward phrasing; could be more natural)
