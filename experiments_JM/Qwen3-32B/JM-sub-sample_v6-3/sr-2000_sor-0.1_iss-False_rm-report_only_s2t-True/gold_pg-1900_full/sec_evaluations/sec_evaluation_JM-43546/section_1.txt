Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You must have heard of, for they are one of their best-liked dishes" (awkward phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex sentences, e.g., "and, if you know anything at all about Scotland, you must have heard of, for they are one of their best-liked dishes"  
- [SYNTAX] "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened, and quickly leaped over the wall" (awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He was quite excited, so Sandy knew that something out of the ordinary had happened" (repetition of "happened" is unnecessary)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the story of the puppy to a description of Scottish afternoon tea without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] The narrative about the puppy is engaging, but the shift to describing food feels abrupt and unrelated  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the food description is unclear in the context of the story about the puppy  
- [TRANSITION] No clear connection between the story of the puppy and the cultural description of Scottish food
