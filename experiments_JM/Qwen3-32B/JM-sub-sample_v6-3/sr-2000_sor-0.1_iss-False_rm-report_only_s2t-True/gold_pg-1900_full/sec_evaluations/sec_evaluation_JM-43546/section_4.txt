Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was the Saturday holiday, and Doctor Gordon had promised to take them for a walk through the old town of Edinburgh." (Awkward phrasing; "It was the Saturday holiday" is unclear.)  
- [SYNTAX] "The doctor, moreover, had written, in his spare moments, a valuable book on Edinburgh..." (Awkward placement of "in his spare moments")  
- [SPELLING] "You must know, was the capital of Scotland in the old days, and virtually is so to-day..." (Use of "to-day" is archaic and inconsistent with modern spelling.)  
- [LEXICON] "I know that American children would think the Scotch regiments the most picturesque soldiers in the world..." (Awkward phrasing; missing preposition or article.)  
- [SYNTAX] "Would you not think he would be cold, with his knees bared to the cold east wind..." (Redundant use of "cold")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the children's game to the doctor's planned walk with no clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about the piper and Highland costume feels disconnected from the narrative flow.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Here is a picture of the piper" is confusing as there is no actual picture included.  
- [TRANSITION] The story abruptly shifts from the castle visit to the Crown jewels without a smooth transition.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the MacPhersons and the Gordon Highlanders feels inserted without clear relevance to the main narrative.
