- [GRAMMAR] "For this reason the genuine Harris tweed always smells smoky." (missing article before "smells").  
- [GRAMMAR] "Donald and Sandy wore jackets made of the celebrated 'Harris tweeds,' which have a queer smoky smell which comes from their being made..." (awkward phrasing and redundancy).  
- [GRAMMAR] "The boys were on the lookout, and Don soon spied it on its high hill rising above the trees." (awkward phrasing).  
- [GRAMMAR] "Castles were always built on high hills, were they not?" (awkward phrasing and redundancy).  
- [GRAMMAR] "So it was, and when Marjorie opened it what do you suppose gravely walked out?" (awkward phrasing).

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the description of the train journey to the arrival at Skylemore Station is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [LOGIC] The shift from the description of the train journey to the birthday celebration the next morning is abrupt and lacks clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of "Auld Wullie" and the collies feels disconnected from the previous narrative about the train and the arrival at Skylemore.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the visit to "Auld Wullie" to the preparation for the party is abrupt and lacks a clear narrative link.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the fancy-dress party is introduced suddenly after the visit to "Auld Wullie," with no clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] The ending of the text is abrupt, with no indication of how the party proceeds or what happens afterward.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different locations and events without clear transitions or explanations.  
- [LOGIC] The introduction of the "tewky" as a gift is somewhat confusing due to the lack of prior context about what a "tewky" is.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the "shepherd's plaid" is inserted without clear connection to the surrounding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The explanation of the sheep-dogs' contest is introduced without clear narrative purpose or connection to the main story.
