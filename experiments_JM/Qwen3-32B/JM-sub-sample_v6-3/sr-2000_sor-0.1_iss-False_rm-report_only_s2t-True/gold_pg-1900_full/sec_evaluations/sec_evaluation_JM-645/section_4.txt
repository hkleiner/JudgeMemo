Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "This extraordinary ‘general intention,’ as you call it—for that’s the most vivid description I can induce you to make of it—is then, generally, a sort of buried treasure?"  
- [GRAMMAR] Misuse of punctuation in "I’d have spent half the night with him. At three o’clock in the morning, not sleeping, remembering moreover how indispensable he was to Lady Jane, I stole down to the library with a candle."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or stylistically inconsistent language (e.g., "I’d have repeated my recent act of faith")  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "Instead of being a pleasure the more they became a resource the less; for from the moment I was unable to follow up the author’s hint I of course felt it a point of honour not to make use professionally of my knowledge of them."  
- [SPELLING] Minor spelling inconsistencies (e.g., "Vereker" vs. "Vereker" vs. "Vereker" – inconsistent capitalization in some contexts)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in narrative from the conversation to the narrator’s internal monologue without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed progression from the dialogue with Vereker to the narrator’s actions and reflections  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the buried treasure" and "the general intention" without sufficient prior explanation  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the narrator’s failed attempt to understand Vereker’s work to the introduction of George Corvick  
- [LOGIC] Confusing cause-effect relationship in the narrator’s emotional response to Vereker’s books and his subsequent interactions with Corvick
