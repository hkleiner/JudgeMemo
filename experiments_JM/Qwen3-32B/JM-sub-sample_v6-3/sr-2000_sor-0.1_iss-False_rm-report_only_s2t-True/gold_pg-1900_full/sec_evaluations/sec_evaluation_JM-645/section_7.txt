Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He didn’t take a book with him—on purpose; indeed he wouldn’t have needed to—he knows every page, as I do, by heart." (awkward phrasing and punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "We had perfectly, we had admirably calculated." (repetition and awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "secousse" (uncommon and possibly misspelled word)  
- [LEXICON] "He’ll come right home—this will bring him." (ambiguous phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "To see Vereker, you mean?" (missing punctuation in dialogue formatting)  
- [SYNTAX] "She hung fire, but at last brought them out." (idiomatic expression used in a confusing way)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had found Mr. Vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret a real intoxication." (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He intimated that the charm of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source." (overuse of commas and complex structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He’ll come right home—this will bring him." (unclear connection between the two clauses)  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts abruptly between dialogue and internal monologue without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "He had thrown up his commission, he had thrown up his book, he had thrown up everything but the instant need to hurry to Rapallo..." (repetition and lack of clarity in the sequence of events)  
- [TRANSITION] "We had talked, heaven knows, enough before, but this was a wondrous lift." (sudden shift in tone and perspective)  
- [LOGIC] "He intimated that the charm of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source." (confusing and abstract phrasing)  
- [LOGIC] "She must have had resources of which I was destitute..." (unclear reference to "resources")  
- [LOGIC] "Ah it mayn’t come to that!" (ambiguous and unclear in context)
