Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "I contrived however to make him answer a few more questions about it, though he did so with visible impatience."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistency in "He comes back to me from that last occasion—for I was never to speak to him again—as a man with some safe preserve for sport."  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous word usage in "He had formed the habit of depending on it, and if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes and lack of clarity in "The reason of his note to me had been that he really didn’t want to give us a grain of succour—our density was a thing too perfect in its way to touch."  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "If I returned on several occasions to the little house in Chelsea I dare say it was as much for news of Vereker as for news of Miss Erme’s ailing parent."

- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from Vereker to Corvick and Gwendolen without clear transition.
