- [SPELLING] "toadied" (should be "toadied" is correct, but may be considered archaic or unclear to modern readers)  
- [SYNTAX] "One, of course, does not mean that the Indian and trapper stories..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [LEXICON] "humble companions" (vague and potentially confusing phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "It appears, however, that I have not been the only lover..." (awkward transition)  
- [SYNTAX] "He also said he was on the track of _Bill Bidden_, another famous trapper, and hoped to send me word that Bill was found, whose original value was sixpence..." (run-on sentence with unclear antecedent)  
- [SYNTAX] "Wearied by sex novels, problem novels, theological novels, and all the other novels with a purpose..." (repetition and awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Just as a tired man throws off his dress coat and slips on an old study jacket, so one lays down the latest thoughtful, or intense, or something worse pseudo work of fiction..." (awkward comparison and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different literary works and authors without clear organization or progression  
- [CLARITY] "One" is used repeatedly as a first-person pronoun, which is archaic and may confuse modern readers  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from discussing trapper stories to discussing _Monte Christo_ and then to Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Rachel of Castlewood and Jeanie Deans is introduced without sufficient context or explanation  
- [CLARITY] "He is also certain to maintain his hold and be an example to writers after many modern realists have been utterly and justly forgotten" (unclear reference to "he")  
- [LOGIC] The text moves from personal recollections to general literary commentary without clear boundaries
