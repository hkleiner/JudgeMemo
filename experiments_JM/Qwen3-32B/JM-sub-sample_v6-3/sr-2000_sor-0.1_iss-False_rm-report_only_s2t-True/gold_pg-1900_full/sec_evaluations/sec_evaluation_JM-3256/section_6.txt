Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "He will leave the Pines Horace, which he has been handling delicately for three weeks, in hopeless admiration..." (awkward phrasing and unclear reference)  
- [SYNTAX] "He will leave the Pines Horace... and be outside the door before a happy thought strikes him..." (confusing sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He has anodynes for his conscience..." (archaic or unclear word choice without context)  
- [SPELLING] "To-morrow" (hyphenated form is outdated and inconsistent with modern usage)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He will calculate shilling by shilling, and the book he purchases with the complete price—that is the price to which he has brought down the seller after two days’ negotiations..." (awkward use of em dash and comma)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "He will order that delightful treasure to be sent to his own address in order that next day he may present it—as a birthday present—to himself." (confusing logic and circular reasoning)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly from the bookman’s self-deception to his reading habits and then to philosophical reflections, with few clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "He has anodynes for his conscience when he seems to be wronging his afflicted family..." (unclear reference to "anodynes" and their function)  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the bookman’s self-purchase to "Concerning tastes in pleasure..." is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] "He will spend the time in the good company of people who will not quarrel with him, nor will he quarrel with them." (repetitive and redundant phrasing)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
