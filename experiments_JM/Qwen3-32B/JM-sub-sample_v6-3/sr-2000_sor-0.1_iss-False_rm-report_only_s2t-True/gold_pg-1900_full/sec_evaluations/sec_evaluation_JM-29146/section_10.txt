Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The man of Irwadi fell, his helmet cracked, he tried to scream--and died." (run-on sentence)
- [SYNTAX] "It was Vardin's voice, and Vardin went on: 'Ramsey, stop her. I can't stop her. It is only granted that I observe--and convince, if I can. I am not a Vegan girl. I am--'" (awkward phrasing and punctuation)
- [SPELLING] "spacesuited" should be "space-suited" (missing hyphen)
- [SYNTAX] "She looked at Ramar Chind and Chind, responding, went to Garr Symm and led him quietly back toward the Dog Star." (confusing subject-verb agreement)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey tackling Margot to Garr Symm running past them without clear transition
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "Ramar Chind and Chind" without clear explanation of who these characters are
- [STRUCTURE] The ending is abrupt with Vardin disappearing and the transition to the Enterprise without clear narrative connection
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the dramatic confrontation to Ramsey and Margot's romantic resolution feels rushed and disconnected from the previous tension

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
