Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Lewd libidinous fantasies, X stands for nothing for nothing for nothing, XXX--she got nowhere." (awkward phrasing and unclear structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "In the early hours of the following morning, behind the cover of what appeared to be a dense early morning fog but what actually was an artificially produced fog..." (redundant and convoluted sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "You've got to be, because the slightest miscalculation can send you fifty thousand light years off course." (missing article "a" before "fifty thousand light years")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "Ramsey's mouth was dry. He could barely keep the thoughts of proto-man from his mind. If Margot read them...." (inconsistent punctuation with ellipsis)  
- [SYNTAX] "But of course, she had another destination in mind." (awkward transition and phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Margot's internal thoughts to the description of the Irwadi technicians and Ramar Chind's actions without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different locations and characters (Enterprise, Dog Star, Graveyard) without clear signposting or logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of hyper-space and its relationship to time is introduced in a dense and confusing manner, making it difficult to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Enterprise's preparation for blastoff to the description of the Dog Star's crew is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The explanation of hyper-space and time is complex and not clearly connected to the plot or character motivations.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
