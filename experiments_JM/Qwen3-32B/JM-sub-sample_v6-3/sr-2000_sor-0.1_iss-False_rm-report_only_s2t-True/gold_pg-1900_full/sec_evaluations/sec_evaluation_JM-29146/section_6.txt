Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he did not like letting Margot know how he felt about her, but it was mostly on a straight physical level" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "he preferred her discovering it to her learning that he'd read the proto-man letter from her father" (confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  
- [LEXICON] "X marks the spot, thought Ramsey. XXX marks the spot-spot-spot." (repetitive and stylistically odd phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "X is a spot in a pot or a lot of rot...." (inconsistent punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Ramsey and Margot's interaction to the introduction of Security Officer Chind with no clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between Ramsey and Margot's perspective and Chind and Symm's without clear indication of time or location  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of "X" is left ambiguous and unresolved, creating confusion for the reader  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Graveyard scene to the Enterprise and Vardin's actions is abrupt and lacks context  
- [CONSISTENCY] The narrative shifts between different characters and locations without clear indication of time progression  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
