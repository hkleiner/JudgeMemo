Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "And let down his mental guard." is a sentence fragment.  
- [SYNTAX] "But if I went out there I'd perish from cold in seconds and lack of air in minutes." lacks parallel structure.  
- [LEXICON] "m.g. gun" is unclear without explanation.  
- [SYNTAX] "You could go out there perfectly protected from the lethal environment by the absence of the time dimension." is awkwardly phrased.  
- [SPELLING] "muzzle-first" is not a standard phrase and may be a typo.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from Ramsey's physical struggle to his internal thoughts is abrupt and lacks smooth connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between Ramsey and Margot without clear transitions, making the flow confusing.  
- [CLARITY] The concept of hyper-space and its relationship to time and physical laws is not clearly explained in this section.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from Ramsey's internal monologue to Margot's actions is jarring and lacks logical progression.  
- [LOGIC] The idea that time does not exist in hyper-space and how this affects physical laws is introduced but not clearly connected to the narrative.
