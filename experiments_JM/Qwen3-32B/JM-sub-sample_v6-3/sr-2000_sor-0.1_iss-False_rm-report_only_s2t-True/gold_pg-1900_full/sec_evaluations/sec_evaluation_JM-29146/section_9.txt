Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "You didn't breathe on a timeless world. You merely--somehow--existed." (awkward phrasing and incomplete thought)  
- [SYNTAX] "He saw--or thought he saw--Margot Dennison in the costume she had worn when they first met." (repetition and awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "insulined" (likely a typo for "insulated")  
- [SYNTAX] "He struck again, harder this time." (repetitive and lacks variation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The scaly green face of the Irwadi within the space-suit grimaced with pain." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It was not possible to die from lack of air or from cold on a world without the time continuum." (conflicts with earlier established rules of the world)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the mystical vision to the physical confrontation with the Irwadi (jarring transition)  
- [CLARITY] "The fog was not lifting. Then it was." (confusing and ambiguous phrasing)  
- [LOGIC] "The Enterprise was empty." (lacks explanation or context for the reader)  
- [LOGIC] "The music was un-Earthly, incapable of repetition, indescribably the loveliest sound he had ever heard." (confusing logic about music and time)
