- [GRAMMAR] "The decision at which Millet p√®re had arrived was prompted by a drawing..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "certainly the young Millet, who had now arrived at the age of eighteen, had not developed..." (cumbersome structure)

- [LEXICON] "He prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him..." (confusing pronoun reference)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "He saw more good in frequenting the museums and making copies of such works as appealed to him than in listening to the advice of his teacher." (long sentence with unclear structure)  

2) Coherence Issues:

- [CLARITY] "The incompatibility of these two men speedily caused the younger to strike out in his own way." (unclear reference to "incompatibility")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Millet's return to Cherbourg to his time in Paris without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] "He needed to grasp the message which lay behind it before he felt fully taken into the confidence of the painter..." (confusing logic and abstract phrasing)
