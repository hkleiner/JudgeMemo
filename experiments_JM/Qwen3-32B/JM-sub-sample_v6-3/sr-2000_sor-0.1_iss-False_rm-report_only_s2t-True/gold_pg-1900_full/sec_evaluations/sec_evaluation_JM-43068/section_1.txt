Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter..." (awkward phrasing and missing preposition)  
- [SYNTAX] "The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna, and the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of Europe, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with their hard drinking and lusty bawling..." (redundant and informal phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to be accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own disposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest masters of the Italian renaissance." (awkward use of semicolon and inconsistent punctuation)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The same incisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the Dutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be considered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel." (sudden shift in focus without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between historical context, artistic analysis, and philosophical reflection without clear signposting or logical progression.  
- [CLARITY] "The difference too between his early efforts and those of his later years is stupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are essentially due to the simplicity of the life he led..." (confusing phrasing and unclear connection between ideas)  
- [TRANSITION] "It has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art." (abrupt shift in tone and topic without prior setup)  
- [LOGIC] "Such simple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of France." (unclear reference to "simple ideas" without prior definition)
