Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In spite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for all under the new régime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any innovations..." (awkward phrasing and word choice)  
- [SYNTAX] "The directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions which had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed away..." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "They endeavoured to infuse some sense of atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees and figures are painfully formal..." (repetition of "their" and awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "régime" is correctly spelled, but the use of accents may be inconsistent in some contexts  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of its time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to any other condition than those which called them forth..." (awkward transition between sentences)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the discussion of classical art to the introduction of Millet is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The paragraph about Millet's family and upbringing is lengthy and could benefit from clearer segmentation.  
- [CLARITY] "The directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions which had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed away..." is somewhat confusing in its meaning.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the general discussion of art to the specific details of Millet's early life lacks smooth transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Gruchy and its environment is descriptive but lacks a clear purpose in the broader narrative.
