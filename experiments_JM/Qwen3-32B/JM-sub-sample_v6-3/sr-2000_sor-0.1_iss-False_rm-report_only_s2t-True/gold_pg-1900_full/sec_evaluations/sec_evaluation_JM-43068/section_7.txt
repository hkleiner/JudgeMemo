Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "betrays the same tremendous conception and broad outlook which characterises many a drawing of Millet's" (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [SPELLING] "pecuniary difficulties and unpopularity, an inevitable result of their intense originality" (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The mind and character of the man can be read in every line and in every touch of the brush" (repetition and awkward structure)  
- [LEXICON] "He was buried in the little cemetery of Chailly, beside his friend Rousseau, amidst the scenery they both loved so well" (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "The anxieties of his troublous life were, however, beginning to show their effect upon his constitution" (awkward placement of "however")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The socialistic doctrines which have been read into the work of Millet are rather the outcome of the world's uneasy conscience..." (sudden shift in topic without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] "The influence of so sincere and profound an artist has necessarily been profound" (repetition of "profound" without clear purpose)  
- [TRANSITION] "There is a spontaneousness about them we search for in vain in his work in oil and pastel" (abrupt transition from biographical to stylistic analysis)  
- [CLARITY] "He has moulded men who have achieved world-wide fame" (vague reference to "men" without specific examples)  
- [LOGIC] "He started life with enormous disadvantages; without friends in influential circles to spread his fame or plead his cause; without money..." (repetition of "without" without clear structure)
