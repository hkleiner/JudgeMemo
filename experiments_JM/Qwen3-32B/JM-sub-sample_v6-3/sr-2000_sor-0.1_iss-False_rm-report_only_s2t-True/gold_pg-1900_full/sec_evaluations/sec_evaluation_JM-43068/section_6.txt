Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in constant fear of the brokers." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "quarrelling" (should be "quarreling" in American English, though acceptable in British English)  
- [SYNTAX] "He was relieved more than once by the kind-hearted and ever faithful Rousseau, who when his friend was sorest pressed found some delicately hidden means to relieve him." (awkward and convoluted sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The prices which Millet obtained for this series of remarkable works was fantastically small." (subject-verb agreement error)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "It was he who acquired for 4000 francs the wonderful 'Peasant grafting a Tree,' when the picture failed to find a purchaser;" (missing comma after "Tree")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "The country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly... no doubt conduced to the development of a more refined and contemplative style than he would otherwise have acquired." (sudden shift in focus from landscape to artistic style without clear connection)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text transitions abruptly from Millet's personal life to financial struggles and then to his artistic output, making the narrative flow uneven.  
- [CLARITY] "The purchase, however, proved a sound investment, for upon the dispersal of his collection it was knocked down for 553,000 francs to a Monsieur Proust..." (confusing reference to "purchase" and "collection")  
- [TRANSITION] "One little gleam of sunshine rendered his later days happy." (sudden shift from financial struggles to a positive event without smooth transition)  
- [LOGIC] "He found, however, a much more genial occupation in accomplishing a series of drawings..." (sudden shift from mural work to drawing commissions without clear connection)
