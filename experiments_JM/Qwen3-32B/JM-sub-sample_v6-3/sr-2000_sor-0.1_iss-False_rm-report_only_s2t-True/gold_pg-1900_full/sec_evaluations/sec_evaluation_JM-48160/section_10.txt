Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "There are no doctors left in this small town and she had been brought..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "I could not imagine for a moment what it was, so little did I expect..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Hôpital Central is beautifully located in a high valley just outside of Bar-le-Duc and looks like a new mining town." (awkward phrasing)

- [GRAMMAR] "The infirmière major, Mlle. de Sézilles, and the médicin chef walked me through..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had not wanted to show me the hospital, even although I had brought..." ("even although" is non-standard phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He had not wanted to show me the hospital, even although I had brought a personal letter..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The men in bed were protected by netting from the loathsome flies which swarm in this district..." (awkward phrasing)

- [GRAMMAR] "There is no question that the wounded in the decorated wards looked more than commonly cheerful..." (awkward phrasing)

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different hospitals and individuals without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative shifts abruptly from describing a woman with a floating kidney to the Hôpital Central and then to Mlle. de Sézilles.  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the woman's personal story to the broader discussion of French nobility and their financial struggles is abrupt.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph shifts from describing French efforts to a direct appeal to readers of the Times, which feels disconnected from the preceding narrative.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Le Bienêtre du Blessé" is unclear without context.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "taubes" (German bombers) is not clearly explained for all readers.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "The French trenches run through his northern estate" is confusing without more context.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "The Eternal France" at the end is vague and lacks explanation.
