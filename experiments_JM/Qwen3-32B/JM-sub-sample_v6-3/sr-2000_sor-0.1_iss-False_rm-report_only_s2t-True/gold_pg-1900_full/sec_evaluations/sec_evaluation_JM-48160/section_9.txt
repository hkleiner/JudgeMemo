Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I will confess that I wandered in upon that preliminary meeting quite by mistake" – awkward phrasing.  
- [SYNTAX] "being under the impression that I had been invited merely to have a cup of tea and some lively conversation" – overly complex and wordy.  
- [SPELLING] "Réformé Numero II." – inconsistent capitalization and formatting.  
- [LEXICON] "I would lie down and die before I would drink a glass of milk" – hyperbolic phrasing that may be distracting.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "At the date of this writing France is still expending two billion francs a month" – missing comma after introductory phrase.  
- [SYNTAX] "to impose a further tax in behalf of an advanced dietary kitchen would possibly lead to a misunderstanding with a large stolid class more than likely to confuse 'delicacies' with 'luxuries.'" – overly long and complex sentence.  
- [SPELLING] "Infirmière Majors" – inconsistent formatting with French terms.  
- [PUNCTUATION] "bureau, chemist shop, surgical dressings stores, &c.," – inconsistent use of punctuation.  
- [SYNTAX] "If the delicacies always craved by the sick will raise the spirits of men..." – awkward and confusing structure.  
- [SPELLING] "grand blessés" – inconsistent formatting with French terms.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the narrator's personal experience to the broader discussion of military hospitals is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between personal anecdotes and general observations without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The purpose of the "private kitchen" is introduced but not clearly explained in the context of the overall narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from discussing dietary needs to the description of bathtubs for the wounded is jarring and lacks a clear connection.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph introduces a new idea (bathtubs) without sufficient context or connection to the previous discussion.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text includes multiple subtopics (diet, military discipline, hospital conditions, etc.) that are not clearly organized or connected.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "America first" is introduced abruptly and lacks sufficient context for the reader to understand its relevance.  
- [LOGIC] The mention of Joffre's tactics is somewhat out of place and does not clearly connect to the main topic of hospital conditions.
