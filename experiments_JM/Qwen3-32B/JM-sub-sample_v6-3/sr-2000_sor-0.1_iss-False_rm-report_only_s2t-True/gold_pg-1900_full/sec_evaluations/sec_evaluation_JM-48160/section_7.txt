Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "I think it was at Sermaize that after driving through a number of streets as completely wrecked as Gerbéviller, we came suddenly upon a terrace of houses quite intact." (awkward phrasing and run-on sentence)  
- [SYNTAX] "Germany not only knew who owned every square inch of ground in France, but where every work of art great and small was installed." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "taubes" (misspelled or unclear reference)  
- [LEXICON] "moist trip through the Vosges" (uncommon phrasing for "wet trip")  
- [GRAMMAR] "They are formidable enough closer to the front." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The automobile was obliged to make its way slowly between the débris that lined either side of the narrow streets" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "One woman who lived in an unpretentious flat in Paris showed me her one rare possession, an ancient silver censer, which was on the German list when they advanced upon Paris." (run-on sentence)  
- [GRAMMAR] "If the French Army surrendered and they spared the city, they purposed to loot it" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We slept at Remiramont the second night, after a moist trip through the Vosges" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Nothing would have induced me to enter that hotel again" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing Gerbéviller to discussing German looting intentions in Paris without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from the description of the German Emperor's failed triumphal entry to the author's personal experience in Remiramont without clear connection  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between different locations (Sermaize, Nancy, Remiramont, Thann) with minimal transitional phrases  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "taubes" is unclear without context  
- [LOGIC] The author's personal experience with Major C. and the military authorities is interwoven with broader war descriptions in a way that sometimes disrupts the flow  
- [LOGIC] The anecdote about the hotel and the French conservatism is somewhat disconnected from the main narrative about the war zone  
- [LOGIC] The shift to the newspaper gamin at the end feels abrupt and unrelated to the preceding content  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
