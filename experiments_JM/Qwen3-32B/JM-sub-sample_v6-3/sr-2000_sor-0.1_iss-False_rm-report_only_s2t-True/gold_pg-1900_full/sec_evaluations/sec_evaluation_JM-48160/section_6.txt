Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Their only excitement they owe to the frequent visits of the taubes" (awkward phrasing, should be "owed")  
- [GRAMMAR] "I forgot to ask. Probably not." (fragmented sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "taubes" (should be capitalized as "Taubes" for consistency with earlier references)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is the bourgeoisie which has reduced the birth rate in France" (awkward phrasing; "that" would be more natural than "which")  
- [SYNTAX] "I shall always be glad that I have seen 'with my own eyes'" (awkward phrasing; "have seen with my own eyes" is more natural)  
- [SPELLING] "Cave Voutée" (inconsistent capitalization; should be "cave voutée" if referring to a common term)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The fields devoid of soldiers were a picturesque sight with the women in blue print frocks and white sunbonnets" (awkward phrasing; "with" should be "and")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The faces of the older wives looked philosophically happy" (awkward phrasing; "looked happy in a philosophical way" is more natural)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Life was beginning in tragedy; and no doubt twenty years hence they will be as torn with anxiety for their absent sons" (awkward semicolon usage)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is, of course, legitimate to bombard any town during a battle, if care is taken to spare great monuments, but not deliberately to set fire to it, house by house, when retreating in fury after having missed victory by a hair" (long and complex sentence with poor flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from describing soldiers in towns to discussing birth rates in France without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Jump from the story about the Bulgarian princes to the description of women harvesting without clear connection  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the hotel in Nancy to the discussion of Miss Polk and Miss Ethel Crocker's reconstruction project  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between multiple topics (soldiers, civilians, bombing, reconstruction) without clear organization or transitions  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Heine" at the end is abrupt and lacks context for the reader  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Heine's prophetic words feels disconnected from the rest of the narrative  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
