- [LEXICON] "I told the coachman to drive to the shopping street, if there was such a thing" (redundant phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "I inquired if it were possible to find a boy to carry my bag. No. Visitors were unusual." (awkward transition between sentences)  
- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "This was the war zone which it took weeks of plotting and the most powerful influences to reach" (confusing phrasing, unclear connection to the previous sentence)

- [CLARITY] "There was a dining room beyond, and I determined to banish my midday hunger before entering upon further adventures" (vague and unclear phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the description of the town to the hotel in Bar-le-Duc is abrupt and lacks smooth connection
