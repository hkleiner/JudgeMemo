Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "but, rather then delay the trip or miss it altogether" (should be "rather than")  
- [SPELLING] "sea-coast" (should be "seacoast" without the hyphen)  
- [SPELLING] "cocoanut grove" (should be "coconut grove")  
- [GRAMMAR] "the writer, armed with a revolver, started out alone" (awkward phrasing; could be smoother)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the potentiality of the situation was thrilling" (awkward phrasing; "potentiality" is not commonly used in this context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "a dignified retreat was made to an open space in the rear from where a less dignified and a more hasty retreat began which did not stop short of Bacalod" (run-on sentence, confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] "sea-coast" (repeated)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the children now saw us, and those of them who could darted away like frightened rabbits" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The children soon recovered from their fright and began to reappear at the doors of the houses, from which now also came the men and women of the settlement" (awkward phrasing and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The old man referred to above, having put on a pair of snow-white pantaloons, appeared now at the doorway of his hut" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Attention was called to a leper woman, apparently about twenty-five years of age, whose face had been attacked by the disease" (awkward phrasing; "attacked by the disease" is not idiomatic)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We were lounging lazily in our hammocks at Jimamaylan one evening in April" (awkward phrasing; "at Jimamaylan" is unclear)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The invitation of the commanding officer to go on a 'hike' was eagerly accepted" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The trail we followed led over rough and rocky country" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We forded rapid streams with the water at our breasts" (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Here stood the first and the twentieth centuries side by side" (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The narrative abruptly shifts from the leper colony to a "hike" without clear transition or connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The two chapters are distinct and disconnected, with no clear narrative thread linking them.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the leper colony is vivid but lacks a clear purpose or direction, making it feel like a disjointed observation.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the leper colony to the "hike" is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The narrative of the "hike" is descriptive but lacks a clear focus or purpose, making it feel like a disconnected account.  
- [CLARITY] The reference to "the writer" in the first chapter is unclear and could confuse the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the leper colony and the "hike" are both detailed but lack a unifying theme or purpose.
