- [SPELLING] "Kanakas" is a specific term that may be unclear without context  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the largest number of teachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that any vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to instruct an alien people"  
- [SPELLING] "resplendent" is used but may be considered overly elaborate or archaic

2) Coherence Issues:

- [LOGIC] The detailed description of the Bishop Museum and the bird feather robe feels disconnected from the main narrative about the ship and its mission  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the voyage to the description of the Pali and the Bishop Museum  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "Century Magazine for September, 1889" is inserted without context or explanation  
- [LOGIC] The anecdote about Napoleon and the sailors is inserted without clear relevance to the main narrative  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from the ship's journey to descriptions of Honolulu and then to Manila without clear narrative progression
