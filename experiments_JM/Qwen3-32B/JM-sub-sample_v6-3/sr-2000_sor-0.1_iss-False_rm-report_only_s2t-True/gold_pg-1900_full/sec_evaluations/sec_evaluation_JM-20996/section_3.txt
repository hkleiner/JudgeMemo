Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The work of the teachers was, in short; to 'make the English language the basis of instruction in the public schools.'" (Misuse of semicolon after "in short")  
- [PUNCTUATION] "We landed, but it was in a method new to us and one not usually employed by the traveling public." (Awkward phrasing and missing comma after "public")  
- [SPELLING] "straddled the neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to be steadied" (Missing article "the" before "ankles")  
- [SYNTAX] "Each of us then straddled the neck of a Filipino standing in the water and was held by ankles to be steadied while our biped mounts proceeded to the shore." (Cumbersome and awkward sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "The boat's crew elevated their trousers' legs also and slided down into the water." ("Slided" is nonstandard; "slid" is correct)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the emotional scene of the women to the description of Philippine towns is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The shift from the dramatic narrative to the administrative details of the schools is jarring and disrupts the flow.  
- [CLARITY] The mention of "the curtain had fallen upon a drama" is metaphorical but lacks sufficient context to fully understand its relevance.  
- [TRANSITION] The introduction of "CHAPTER IV. - WHAT THE TEACHERS DID." is abrupt and lacks a smooth transition from the preceding narrative.  
- [LOGIC] The description of the town of Bacalod and the arrival of the teachers is detailed but lacks a clear narrative thread connecting it to the previous chapter.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
