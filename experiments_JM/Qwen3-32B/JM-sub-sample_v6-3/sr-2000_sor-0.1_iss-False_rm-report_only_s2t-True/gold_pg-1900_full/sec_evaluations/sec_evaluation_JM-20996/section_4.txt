Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "we forewent the pleasures of his oratory and turned our attention to the savory odor of lamb, chicken, and roast pig that came slyly stealing up our nostrils to send us nerve dispatches about the gastronomic delights of our not far distant future." (awkward phrasing and overuse of adjectives)  
- [SYNTAX] "for, as soon as the pleasant task of one dish was completed by any one, the next was served him at once regardless of the progress made by the others at the table." (awkward structure and unclear pronoun reference)  
- [LEXICON] "No matter of what materials a dish is composed, just so long as it is sweet, it is dulce." (redundant phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "St. Vitus" (correct, but the reference is archaic and may be confusing)  
- [SYNTAX] "My eyes must have told the story that my lips could not utter in Spanish, for she smiled upon me sweetly, arose, and put her hand upon my shoulder." (awkward transition between clauses)  
- [GRAMMAR] "A second attempt to follow the music met with results similar to the first, and during the third attempt, which seemed to be trembling on the verge of a failure, St. Vitus let go my companion and seized me with such vigor that she, who was small even for a Filipino, was gathered up bodily and taken around the room at such a pace that her toes touched the floor only at far distant intervals." (overly complex sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "It was easy to see that the Filipinos really had a good deal of money; that they liked to dress was apparent; and that they believed in a table loaded with good things was a fact to which all of us were enthusiastic witnesses." (awkward and repetitive structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "The process of beautifying and improving the city which is constantly going on bids fair to give us at no distant day a city of which we may well be proud." (awkward phrasing and outdated expression)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The transition from the dinner and dance to the description of housekeeping in the Philippines is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.  
- [STRUCTURE] The shift from describing the social event to the economic and logistical challenges of housekeeping is jarring and lacks a smooth transition.  
- [CLARITY] The description of the servant chain ("assistant at four dollars a month; in less than another week that assistant had employed him an assistant at two dollars a month...") is confusing and repetitive.  
- [TRANSITION] The shift from the description of the Filipino attire to the discussion of domestic economy is abrupt and lacks a logical progression.  
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about the origin of food and tableware is disconnected from the previous discussion of housekeeping and servants.  
- [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Manila lacks a clear connection to the preceding sections and feels like a new topic introduced without context.
