Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia at present lies in seas of blood and tears because of her enormous sacrifices..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "Birjeviya Viedomosti" (possibly misspelled or non-standard transliteration)  
- [SYNTAX] "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army, and three-four times all the forces mustered by the United States." (missing hyphen in "three-four")  
- [LEXICON] "Russia's present pitiful condition is the result of her self-sacrificing services to humanity." (word choice may be overly sentimental or vague)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "In 1915 Russia, having shouldered alone the whole burden..." (awkward comma placement)  
- [SYNTAX] "To this it must be added that Russia entered the War unprepared for a modern struggle." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "barbed-wire entanglements" (hyphenation inconsistency)  
- [GRAMMAR] "In the fall of 1917 the Russian Armies collapsed after months of intensive German and Bolshevist propaganda..." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text shifts abruptly from describing Russia's sacrifices to analyzing Germany's chances of winning, with minimal transitional support.  
- [STRUCTURE] The argument is repetitive, emphasizing Russia's role multiple times without clear progression.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between Russia's early efforts and the eventual collapse of the Central Powers is not clearly explained.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the introduction to the chapter "Was it Possible for Germany to Win the War?" is abrupt and lacks context.  
- [LOGIC] The claim that Russia "sapped the resources of the enemy" is not sufficiently supported with evidence or explanation.  
- [CLARITY] The phrase "the final catastrophe of the Central Powers was the direct consequence of the offensive of the Allies in 1918" is ambiguous in its attribution of cause and effect.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
