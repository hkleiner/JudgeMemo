Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia, having shouldered alone the whole burden..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia, having diverted the forces of the enemy, afforded the Allies..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Russia's role in the recent war was so important and extraordinary that without Russia the very idea of a struggle with German militarism would have been impossible." (cumbersome sentence structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The tragedy of the Russian situation lay in the cruel fact that Russia, while only one-tenth of her Armies were armed, was facing Germany and Austria..." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "We have concluded our sketch of Russia's participation in the World War with 1917. But 1918 also has its story..." (sudden shift in tone and structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Until the United States arrives on the scene! Why, that inevitably means months and months of waiting." (awkward use of exclamation and rhetorical question)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from historical analysis to speculative future conflict with Germany without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Repetition of the question "Where will Russia be then?" without new context or development  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves abruptly from a summary of Russia's role in WWI to a speculative analysis of future conflicts, lacking smooth transitions  
- [CLARITY] The final section is speculative and lacks clear connection to the preceding historical analysis  
- [LOGIC] The argument about Germany's future resurgence is introduced without sufficient prior context or evidence  
- [LOGIC] The comparison between Germany and France in terms of population is introduced abruptly and lacks clear relevance to the preceding content
