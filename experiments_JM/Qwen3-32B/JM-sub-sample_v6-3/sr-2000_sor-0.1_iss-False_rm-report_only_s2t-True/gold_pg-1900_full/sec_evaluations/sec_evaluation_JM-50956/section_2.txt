Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "1Â½, 2, and sometimes even 3 times as many men as the Russians" (awkward phrasing and inconsistent formatting of numbers)  
- [SPELLING] "sonov" (likely a typo, should be "war" or another word)  
- [SYNTAX] "It is just as easy--from an examination of the maps..." (awkward use of em dash and sentence structure)  
- [LEXICON] "sanguine World struggle" (inappropriate adjective "sanguine" for the context)  
- [GRAMMAR] "the death of Samsonov and of a part of his staff and the disruption of liaison were other causes" (repetition and awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "It is difficult to understand how a serious-minded military leader can stoop to employ... 'yellow press'..." (sudden shift in tone and argument without clear transition)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between general historical analysis and specific critiques of Ludendorf's memoirs without clear signposting or logical flow.  
- [CLARITY] "the sanguine World struggle" (unclear and confusing phrasing)  
- [TRANSITION] "Later, when Russia was prepared..." (abrupt transition without clear connection to the previous paragraph)  
- [LOGIC] "It is to be regretted that the extraordinary conditions which developed in Russia..." (unclear reference to "extraordinary conditions" without prior explanation)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
