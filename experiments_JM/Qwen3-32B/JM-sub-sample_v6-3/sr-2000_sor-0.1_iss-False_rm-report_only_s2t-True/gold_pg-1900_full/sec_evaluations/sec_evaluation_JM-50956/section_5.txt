Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It is but natural that the resistance of the Russians in 1915 prevented the Germans from exploiting that success which they regarded as a big one, but which, as a matter of fact, consisted only in the systematic retreat of the Russian Army which was without arms and munitions." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The offensive of Brusilov in the following year, which netted him more than 200,000 prisoners and made Ludendorf, as he himself says, frequently worry about the fate of the entire Austro-German front in Russia, demonstrates how the offensive of Ludendorf in 1915 hastened 'the final overthrow of Russia.'" (cumbersome and confusing structure)  
- [SPELLING] "per cent." (inconsistent formatting with period)  
- [SYNTAX] "It was only through Russia's military operations that the Germans were driven to such an unfavorable, hopeless grouping of their forces." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Notwithstanding that nothing had been prepared for such an offensive, General Brusilov launched it along a front two hundred miles long, with the troops he just happened to have on the spot." (awkward phrasing and missing punctuation)  
- [SYNTAX] "The effects of Brusilov's offensive proved to be so far-reaching as to affect not only the situation on the Italian front but also that on the French main front." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "So did Russia once more fulfill her obligation towards her allies, as soon as her Army had received some quantity of munitions." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Still earlier, during the Verdun period, the Russian Army, not yet recuperated from the hard blows of 1915, did by no means stand by as an idle onlooker of the heroic efforts of the French at Verdun." (awkward phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "The Russian Army had not yet succeeded in recuperating from the effects of its great summer offensive of 1916." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different military campaigns and events without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the overall narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] The section is organized in a somewhat disjointed manner, with abrupt shifts between 1915, 1916, and the Brusilov offensive.  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly complex and lack clarity, such as the sentence about the effects of Brusilov's offensive on both the Italian and French fronts.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the chapter "Salvation of Roumania" is abrupt and lacks context or explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The connection between the Russian Army's actions in 1915 and the events in 1916 is not clearly explained, leading to confusion.  
- [CLARITY] The text frequently references Ludendorf's memoirs and statements without sufficient context for the reader.  
- [LOGIC] The argument that Russia's actions "hastened the final overthrow of Germany" is not clearly supported or explained in the text.
