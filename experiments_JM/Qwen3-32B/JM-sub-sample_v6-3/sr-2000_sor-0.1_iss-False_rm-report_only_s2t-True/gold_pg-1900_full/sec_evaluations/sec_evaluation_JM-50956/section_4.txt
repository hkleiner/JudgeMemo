Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "1915 they were swallowed up by the Russian front during the German offensive in Poland" (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "If we take into consideration all the Russian theatres of war, including those in Asia, the enemy kept on the Russian fronts 164 infantry divisions and 28 cavalry divisions,--altogether 192 divisions (in May, 1917) while on the Anglo-French front the enemy had in May, 1917, only 142 divisions." (run-on sentence with inconsistent punctuation)  
- [LEXICON] "the naked breasts of the Russian soldiers" (unusual phrasing that may confuse readers)  
- [PUNCTUATION] "192 divisions (in May, 1917) while on the Anglo-French front the enemy had in May, 1917, only 142 divisions." (inconsistent use of parentheses and commas)  
- [SPELLING] "1915 they were swallowed up by the Russian front during the German offensive in Poland" (awkward word choice)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] "Who knows what might have been the result of the German offensive in France had those German reserves which perished in Russia broken through somewhere in the north of France simultaneously with the storming of Verdun, in February." (hypothetical scenario is vague and lacks clear connection to the main argument)  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts abruptly between historical facts, rhetorical questions, and interpretations of Ludendorf's memoirs without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] "In which one of these four instances, then, did Falkenhayn interfere?" (rhetorical question disrupts the logical flow and is not clearly tied to the preceding argument)  
- [TRANSITION] The paragraph about Ludendorf's memoirs and his criticism of Falkenhayn is introduced without a clear transition from the preceding discussion of the Russian front.  
- [LOGIC] "We shall not enter into the personal disputes between Ludendorf and Falkenhayn, whom Ludendorf throughout criticises sharply." (sudden shift to personal disputes without clear relevance to the broader argument)
