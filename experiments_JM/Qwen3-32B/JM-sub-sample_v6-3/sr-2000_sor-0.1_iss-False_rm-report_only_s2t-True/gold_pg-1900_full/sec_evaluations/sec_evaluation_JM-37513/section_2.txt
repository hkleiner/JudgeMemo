1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "the discussion of which, in the Nonconformist of 1842, constituted the first step from the life of an engineer to that other kind of life..."  
- [GRAMMAR] Overuse of passive voice and nominalizations, e.g., "It will be urged that Spencer widened to men's view the scope of scientific explanation."

- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in the relationship between Spencer's ideas and the author's interpretation, especially in the final sections.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs, e.g., from the discussion of Spencer's creed to the doctrine of the Unknowable.
