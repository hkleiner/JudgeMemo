Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "We may speak of them as constitutive of the products in a higher stage of relatedness, thus distinguishing constitutive from additive properties."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and technical terms without clear definition (e.g., "constitutive properties," "heteropathic laws").  
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous pronoun reference in "they were, as Tyndall said, 'once latent in a fiery cloud.'"  
- [SYNTAX] Long and complex sentences that hinder readability (e.g., "But if new relationships and new properties appear in the course of evolutionary progress, where is the opportunity for that unification of scientific knowledge which, according to Spencer, is the goal of philosophy?").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or inconsistent punctuation in some complex sentences.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing constitutive properties in chemistry to invoking philosophical concepts like the "Unknowable" without clear transition.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of the same ideas (e.g., "constitutive properties") without clear progression or development.  
- [CLARITY] Lack of clear explanation for key terms (e.g., "creative evolution," "heteropathic laws") that are central to the argument.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs discussing different types of relatedness (A, B, C) without sufficient linking.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the empirical observations and the philosophical conclusions drawn from them.
