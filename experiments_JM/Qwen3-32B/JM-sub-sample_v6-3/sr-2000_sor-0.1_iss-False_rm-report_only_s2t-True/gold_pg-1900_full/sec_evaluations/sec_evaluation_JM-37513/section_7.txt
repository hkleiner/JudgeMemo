Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "It certainly is not yet attained. But I see no reason why we should not regard it as attainable."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and technical terms without clear definition, e.g., "cognitive relatedness," "noumenon," "symbolic."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies, e.g., "There remains for consideration the place of the cognitive relation in Spencer's philosophy of science."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of quotation marks and em dashes, e.g., "We are told: 'The properties of substances...'"  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in sentences such as "It is a terribly ambiguous way of expressing the fact."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some ideas are introduced without sufficient context or explanation, e.g., "the Unknowable" and "emergents."  
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and specific examples without clear transitions.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between discussing Spencer's views and the author's critique, e.g., from quoting Spencer to evaluating his position.  
- [CLARITY] Some arguments are repetitive or circular, e.g., the discussion of "subjective affections" and "states of consciousness."  
- [COHERENCE] The overall argument is complex and occasionally disjointed, making it difficult to follow the author's main point.
