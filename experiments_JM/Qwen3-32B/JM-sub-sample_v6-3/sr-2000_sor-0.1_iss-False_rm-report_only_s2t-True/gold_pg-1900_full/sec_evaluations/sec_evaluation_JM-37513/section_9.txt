Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "We do not speak of parallelism between physiological and physico-chemical processes."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and technical terms without simplification, e.g., "cognitive process implies a physiological basis."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in long sentences, e.g., "He believed 'that mind and nervous action are the subjective and objective faces of the same thing', though 'we remain utterly incapable of seeing or even imagining how the two are related'."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em-dashes and quotation marks without clear purpose.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in abstract concepts, e.g., "the part knows the whole in a way that the whole does not know the part."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments shift abruptly between abstract concepts and concrete examples without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves between multiple philosophical positions (e.g., parallelism, identity hypothesis) without clearly distinguishing their relationships.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs, especially when introducing new ideas or examples.  
- [CLARITY] The central argument is occasionally obscured by dense and repetitive phrasing.  
- [CONSISTENCY] The text oscillates between theoretical discussion and illustrative examples without maintaining a consistent focus.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
