Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences, e.g., "Of course this statement is open to question."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract and technical terms without clear definition, e.g., "effective relatedness," "heredity-relatedness."  
- [GRAMMAR] Ambiguous subject-verb agreement in some sentences, e.g., "The existing orbital motion at any moment implies, too, the preceding motion which it has, in a sense, inherited from the past."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of commas and semicolons, leading to run-on sentences.  
- [STYLE] Repetition of phrases such as "physico-chemical" and "relatedness" without variation.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are abstract and lack clear logical progression, e.g., the shift from "gravitative knowledge" to "biological knowledge" is abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between multiple concepts (physiological processes, heredity, cognition) without clear transitions.  
- [CLARITY] The meaning of key terms like "awareness" and "cognition" is not consistently defined, leading to confusion.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs, especially when introducing new examples or analogies.  
- [COHESION] The text references prior sections and concepts without sufficient context, making it difficult to follow independently.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
