Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the much bewigged and powdered year of 1732"  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of Grasse"  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence in "the worthy mercer was first in all the little town to know by his modest traffic in them; and that, too, only long after the things they shadowed were buried under new millineries and fopperies and fantastic riot in the gay capital"  
- [SPELLING] "pleasaunces" is an archaic or misspelled word  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the eleven-year-old boy's ears heard of the death of the minister"  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence in "He recovered, to enter Paris soon after as the Well-Beloved, and to be reconciled with the frail Chateauroux before she died in the sudden agony in which she swore she had been poisoned"  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence in "She mothered every industry"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from the description of Grasse to the political gossip about Louis XV and the Pompadour without clear transition  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between the life of Fragonard and the political and cultural history of France without clear connection  
- [CLARITY] The passage is dense with historical and political details that may confuse the reader about the main narrative focus  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from the description of the Pompadour's influence to the chapter "Rome" without clear linkage to the previous content
