Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The National Convention also displayed the antagonism of the two wings of the now all-powerful Girondist party--the Girondists and the Jacobins or Montagnards." (awkward phrasing and redundancy)  
- [SYNTAX] "The 10th of January 1793 saw the king's head fall to the guillotine--the Jacobins had triumphed." (awkward structure)  
- [SPELLING] "The scaffolds reeked with blood--from that of Marie Antoinette and Egalité Orleans to that of the Girondist deputies and Madame Roland..." (missing apostrophe in "Egalité Orleans")  
- [SYNTAX] "In a mad moment the Du Barry, who had shown the noblest side of her character in befriending the old allies of her bygone days of greatness, published a notice of a theft from her house." (long and complex sentence with unclear structure)  
- [GRAMMAR] "He returned to Paris a poor old man." (awkward phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "The gods of elegance were dead; a severe and frigid morality stood upon their altars." (awkward and overly poetic phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the Reign of Terror to Fragonard's personal experiences without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative shifts between political events and Fragonard's personal life in a disjointed manner.  
- [CLARITY] The connection between Fragonard's artistic struggles and the political events is not clearly established.  
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the Reign of Terror to the Directory and then to Napoleon is abrupt and lacks explanation.  
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about Fragonard's return to Paris and his artistic decline is disconnected from the preceding historical events.
