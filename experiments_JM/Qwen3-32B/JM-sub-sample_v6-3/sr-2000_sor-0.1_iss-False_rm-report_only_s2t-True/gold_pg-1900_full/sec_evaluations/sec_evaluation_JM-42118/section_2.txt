Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "So it came about--'twas in that year of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle..."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or stylistically inconsistent language (e.g., "'twas," "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honor√©, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days")  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor grammatical inconsistencies in complex sentences (e.g., "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em-dashes and parentheticals, disrupting sentence flow  
- [STYLE] Inconsistent tone between descriptive and narrative sections  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Fragonard's artistic development to political events (e.g., "Meanwhile the quarrels between priests and parliaments had grown very bitter")  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between Fragonard's personal journey and broader historical context (e.g., the Damiens assassination)  
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow the narrative thread  
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative occasionally digresses without clear connection to the main storyline (e.g., the detailed explanation of tapestry production)  
- [COHESION] Lack of clear signposting between Fragonard's time in Paris, Rome, and his relationships with other artists
