Okay, let's start by looking at the Coherence score. The sections have varying scores, mostly in the 4.0 to 4.5 range, except for section_01 and section_06, which are 4.0 and 3.5 respectively. The issues mentioned for Coherence include problems with transitions, logic, clarity, and structure. For example, in section_01, there are abrupt shifts and underexplained links. Section_06 has more significant issues with structure and transitions. The recurring issues across sections are abrupt transitions and underexplained connections. The majority of sections are in the 4.0-4.5 range, but the lower scores in some sections might bring the overall score down a bit. Considering that most sections are above 4.0 and the issues are present but not pervasive, a final Coherence score of 4.0 seems appropriate.

Now for Fluency. The section scores range from 3.5 in section_01 up to 4.5 in sections 03 and 07. The issues here are spelling, grammar, syntax, punctuation, and lexicon. Section_01 has some problematic syntax and archaic phrasing, while other sections have minor issues like spelling errors or awkward phrasing. The majority of sections are in the 4.0-4.5 range. However, the lowest score is 3.5, which might indicate some more significant issues in fluency. But since most sections are higher and the errors are mostly minor and not pervasive, the overall Fluency score should be around 4.0. The recurring issues are mostly minor and don't disrupt readability much, so a 4.0 is reasonable.
