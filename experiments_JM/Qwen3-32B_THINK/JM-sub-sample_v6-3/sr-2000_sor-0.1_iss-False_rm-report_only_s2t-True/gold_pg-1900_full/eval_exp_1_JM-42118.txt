I need to analyze the section-wise evaluation report and determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency on a 1-5 scale (including half-points). Let me carefully review the report for patterns and issues across all sections.

## Fluency Analysis

Let me summarize the fluency issues across all sections:

Section 1 (4.0): 
- Complex sentence structures
- Archaic phrasing
- Missing commas in long clauses

Section 2 (4.0):
- Overuse of em dashes and parentheses
- Hyphenation inconsistencies
- Archaic phrasing
- Long complex sentences
- Misplaced commas

Section 3 (4.0):
- Awkward phrasing and structure
- Grammar issues (subject-verb agreement)
- Some archaic phrasing

Section 4 (4.5):
- Awkward phrasing
- Overuse of semicolons
- Misplaced commas
- Unclear phrasing

Section 5 (3.5):
- Awkward phrasing in long sentences
- Spelling inconsistencies
- Archaic expressions
- Grammar issues (ambiguous pronouns)
- Inconsistent punctuation

Section 6 (3.0):
- Run-on sentences
- Overuse of archaic language
- Inconsistent punctuation
- Mixed tenses

Section 7 (3.5):
- Awkward phrasing
- Grammar issues (missing prepositions)
- Unnatural phrasing
- Spelling inconsistencies
- Cumbersome sentence structure

Section 8 (4.0):
- Run-on sentences with em-dashes
- Missing commas
- Sentence fragments
- Ambiguous phrasing

Section 9 (4.0):
- Complex convoluted structures
- Overuse of em-dashes
- Archaic phrasing

Patterns:
- Archaic/old-fashioned language is common throughout
- Complex sentence structures appear in most sections
- Punctuation issues (missing commas, misplaced commas, overuse of em-dashes) are consistent
- Some sections show more severe problems (like section 6 with a score of 3.0)
- Issues tend to be minor rather than severe, but they recur across multiple sections
- The lowest fluency score is 3.0 in section 6, with most other sections scoring 4.0 or higher

## Coherence Analysis

Now let me summarize the coherence issues across all sections:

Section 1 (4.0):
- Abrupt shifts from local to national politics
- Unclear connections between Fragonard's life and Parisian developments
- Dense historical digressions

Section 2 (4.5):
- Sudden shift from artistic training to political events
- Tangential explanations
- Unclear connections between characters
- Abrupt jumps between topics

Section 3 (3.5):
- Abrupt transitions between political intrigue and Fragonard's return
- Sudden shifts without context
- Disjointed shifts between Fragonard's career and unrelated events
- Overlapping timelines without clear linkage

Section 4 (3.5):
- Abrupt shift from Fragonard's story to political narrative
- Sudden detours
- Unclear relevance of political commentary
- Jarring jumps between topics

Section 5 (3.5):
- Abrupt shift from Du Barry to marriage
- Sudden jumps between political and artistic details
- Disconnected paragraphs
- Unclear references without context

Section 6 (3.5):
- Abrupt transitions between historical figures
- Dense content with unclear connections
- Sudden shifts from artistic to political
- Ambiguous references without context

Section 7 (3.0):
- Abrupt shift to "THE TERROR" without linkage
- Sudden jumps between topics
- Disjointed progression
- Unclear relevance of political events

Section 8 (3.0):
- Abrupt transitions between political and personal
- Disjointed chronology
- Unclear references without context
- Sudden shifts in focus

Section 9 (4.5):
- Abrupt shift from death to historical context
- Dense information about multiple artists
- Sudden jump from family to legacy

Patterns:
- Abrupt shifts and transitions are common throughout
- Disjointed shifts between Fragonard's personal narrative and political events
- Sudden detours and tangents appear frequently
- Some sections show more severe issues (like section 7 with a score of 3.0)
- The lowest coherence score is 3.0 in sections 7 and 8, with most other sections scoring 3.5 or higher
- The text appears to struggle with maintaining a clear, logical progression, especially when switching between personal narrative and historical/political context

## Final Scores

For Fluency:
- The issues are mostly minor but recurring (archaic language, complex structures, punctuation problems).
- The lowest score is 3.0 in one section, but most sections score 4.0 or higher.
- Given the consistent issues across sections, I'd give a score slightly below 4.0.
- Considering the severity and frequency of issues, a score of 3.5 seems appropriate.

For Coherence:
- The text has more significant issues with maintaining logical flow and transitions.
- The abrupt shifts and disjointed sections are more problematic than the fluency issues.
- The lowest scores are 3.0 in sections 7 and 8, with many other sections scoring 3.5.
- Given the consistent issues with logical progression and transitions, I'd give a score around 3.0-3.5.
- Considering the severity and frequency of coherence issues, a score of 3.25 (which I'll round to 3.5) seems appropriate.

Final scores:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
