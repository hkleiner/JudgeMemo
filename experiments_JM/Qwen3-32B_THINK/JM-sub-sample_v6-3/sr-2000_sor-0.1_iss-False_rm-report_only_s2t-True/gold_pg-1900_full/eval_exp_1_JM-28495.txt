Let me analyze the section-wise evaluation report to determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency.

For Fluency:
- Section 01: 4.0 - Some spelling, syntax, lexicon, and punctuation issues
- Section 02: 5.0 - No issues
- Section 03: 4.5 - Some archaic language and syntax issues
- Section 04: 4.0 - Grammar, syntax, punctuation, and lexicon issues
- Section 05: 4.5 - Punctuation and syntax issues
- Section 06: 4.5 - Syntax and lexicon issues
- Section 07: 4.0 - Punctuation, syntax, and word choice issues
- Section 08: 4.5 - Syntax issue

Looking at recurring problems:
- There are consistent minor syntax issues across multiple sections
- Punctuation issues occur repeatedly
- Lexicon/word choice is occasionally problematic
- Section 02 is the only section with perfect fluency
- No section has major fluency problems that make reading difficult

For Coherence:
- Section 01: 4.5 - Some logical shifts and structural issues
- Section 02: 5.0 - No issues
- Section 03: 4.0 - Some transitions and logical connections issues
- Section 04: 4.5 - Some structural and transitional issues
- Section 05: 4.0 - Transitional and logical issues
- Section 06: 4.5 - Logical and structural issues
- Section 07: 4.0 - Multiple transitional, clarity, logical, and consistency issues
- Section 08: 5.0 - No issues

Looking at recurring problems for coherence:
- There are frequent transitional issues between sections
- Some logical connections between events are unclear
- Section 02 and 08 have perfect coherence, but the rest have some issues
- The problems are generally minor and don't make the overall narrative incoherent

Based on these observations, I would rate:
- Fluency: 4.25 - The text is mostly fluent with minor issues that don't significantly disrupt readability
- Coherence: 4.25 - The text is mostly coherent with some minor transitional and logical issues that don't significantly disrupt the overall narrative

However, since the scale only allows half-point increments, I'll round to the nearest half-point:
- Fluency: 4.25 rounds to 4.25 (which is on the allowed scale)
- Coherence: 4.25 rounds to 4.25 (which is on the allowed scale)

But wait - let me reconsider the rounding. Since the instruction says "You are allowed to use half-points: [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]" and 4.25 isn't on this list, I need to round to the nearest allowed half-point.

For Fluency: 4.25 would round to 4.0 since it's exactly between 4.0 and 4.5
For Coherence: 4.25 would also round to 4.0 for the same reason

But wait - I need to be more precise. Let me analyze again.

For Fluency:
- 3 out of 8 sections have a 4.5 score
- 3 out of 8 sections have a 4.0 score
- 1 out of 8 sections has a perfect 5.0 score
- 1 section has a 4.5 score

Average = (3×4.5 + 3×4.0 + 1×5.0 + 1×4.5) / 8 = (13.5 + 12.0 + 5.0 + 4.5) / 8 = 35 / 8 = 4.375

For Coherence:
- 2 out of 8 sections have a 5.0 score
- 3 out of 8 sections have a 4.5 score
- 3 out of 8 sections have a 4.0 score

Average = (2×5.0 + 3×4.5 + 3×4.0) / 8 = (10.0 + 13.5 + 12.0) / 8 = 35.5 / 8 = 4.4375

Given these averages, I should round to the nearest half-point:
- Fluency: 4.375 rounds to 4.5
- Coherence: 4.4375 rounds to 4.5

Let me reconsider my analysis once more before finalizing. The average scores are 4.375 for fluency and 4.4375 for coherence, which both round to 4.5 on the half-point scale. These scores indicate that the text is mostly fluent and mostly coherent with only minor issues that don't significantly disrupt the reading experience.

I'll finalize my assessment as:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
