Alright, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The text is about the remains of religious buildings and hospitals in Canterbury, along with some churches. 

For fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The first sentence is a bit long but seems okay. "The remains of the buildings of the Black, or Preaching, Friars, and those of the Grey Friars, who belonged to the rule of St. Francis, are on islands formed by the Stour, and are marked in nearly every plan of the town." There's a comma splice here, but maybe it's acceptable in historical texts. The sentence structure is complex but not incorrect. 

Next, "The hospitals include that of St. John the Baptist in North Gate Street, Eastbridge Hospital in St. Peter Street, and the Poor Priests' Hospital near Stour Street." The use of "that of" is correct, but the list is well-structured. 

"Outside the city, at Harbledown, is the interesting old Hospital of St. Nicholas, a home for lepers, who were separately housed." The phrase "a home for lepers, who were separately housed" is a bit awkward. Maybe "a home for lepers, who were housed separately" would be better. 

Moving to the next paragraph: "Of the churches it would be easy to write a great deal, but there is merely space to point out that the only one lacking in interest is All Saints' in High Street." The word "merely" is a bit out of place here, but it's clear. 

"At St. Dunstan's the head of Sir Thomas More is preserved in a vault, but it is never possible to see it, and one must be content with the picturesque brick gateway of the Roper house in St. Dunstan's Street." The sentence structure is a bit complex but not incorrect. 

Now for coherence. The text transitions from the remains of the friars to the hospitals, then to churches. The flow is logical, moving from one set of structures to another. The mention of Harbledown as outside the city is clear. The part about the churches is concise but makes sense. There's a slight jump from hospitals to churches, but it's not too abrupt. 

Possible coherence issues: The transition from hospitals to churches is a bit sudden, but given the context, it's understandable. The mention of the head of Sir Thomas More in a vault that's never seen might be confusing, but it's a specific historical fact. 

Overall, the text is well-structured and flows logically, with minor issues in sentence structure and word choice. The coherence is strong, with a clear progression from one topic to the next. Fluency has a few minor issues but nothing major.
