Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a long historical text about Canterbury and its cathedral, and I need to assess its fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. I'll read through the current section to spot any issues. The text is quite detailed and dense with historical information. First, I notice some sentence structures are complex, which might affect readability. For example, "The body was brought from London, where it had been buried, back to Canterbury ten years later by Canute..." – the use of "where" creates a dependent clause that could be clearer. 

Looking for grammar or spelling errors. I don't see any obvious typos, but there are some awkward phrasings. For instance, "having made a journey to Rome in 1031, among other pious resolutions, declared that he would amend his life..." – the structure here is a bit jumbled. Also, "the Saxon cathedral was properly repaired and decorated." The word "properly" might be redundant or could be better placed.

Next, coherence. The text moves through historical events chronologically, but there are some jumps. For example, the transition from Canute's actions to the Norman Conquest and the fire in Canterbury is abrupt. The mention of Lanfranc and the construction of the cathedral follows, but the connection between the fire and Lanfranc's actions isn't clearly explained. 

There's also a shift in focus when discussing Becket's murder. The paragraph about Becket is detailed but might feel disconnected from the prior sections about the cathedral's construction. The use of quotes from Eadmer and the knights' dialogue could be integrated more smoothly. Additionally, the text references events and people without sufficient context, like "Prior Ernulph pulled down the east end..." – a reader might not know who Ernulph is without prior knowledge.

Looking at the structure, the text is organized by time periods but some parts are repetitive or have redundant information. For example, the mention of the cathedral's destruction and rebuilding is discussed multiple times in close proximity, which could confuse the flow. Also, the transition to the murder of Becket is sudden after discussing the cathedral's development, which might disrupt the coherence.

In terms of transitions between paragraphs, some are abrupt. For instance, after discussing the completion of the cathedral in 1077, the text jumps to the murder of Becket forty years later without a smooth transition. This could make the narrative feel disjointed.

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with complex sentences and awkward phrasing but is generally readable. Coherence has more noticeable problems with abrupt transitions and some unclear connections between events. The text is well-informed but might benefit from better structuring and clearer transitions to maintain a logical flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The body was brought from London, where it had been buried, back to Canterbury ten years later by Canute..." (clauses disrupt flow).
- [LEXICON] Redundant use of "properly" in "the Saxon cathedral was properly repaired and decorated."
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled structure in "having made a journey to Rome in 1031, among other pious resolutions, declared..."
- [SYNTAX] Unclear antecedent in "the King over the water commands you to perform your duty to the King on this side of the water..."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between Canute's actions and the Norman Conquest fire without contextual linkage.
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed shift from cathedral rebuilding to Becket's murder without transitional explanation.
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to historical figures (e.g., "Prior Ernulph," "Archbishop de Corbeuil") without introductory context.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from 1077 cathedral completion to Becket's murder "forty years later" without narrative bridge.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
