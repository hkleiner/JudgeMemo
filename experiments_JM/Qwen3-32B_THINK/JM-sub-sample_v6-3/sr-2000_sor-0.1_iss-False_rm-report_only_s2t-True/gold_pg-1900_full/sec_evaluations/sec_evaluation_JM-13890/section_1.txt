Let me evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons was sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., "To thee, Thomas Becket, some time Archbishop of Canterbury"--who had then been dead for 368 years--"to appear within thirty days to answer to a charge of treason, contumacy, and rebellion against his sovereign lord, King Henry II." This has a punctuation issue with the quotation marks and the use of em dashes.

2. [SPELLING] "PalÃ¦olithic" appears to have a special character encoding issue.

3. [SPELLING] "CÃ¦sar" also has a special character encoding issue.

4. [SPELLING] "Dane John--another form of the familiar donjon." This sentence has a spelling issue with the use of em dashes and lacks clarity in its structure.

5. [SPELLING] "Durovernum, a name perhaps derived from the British Derwhern, and although their historians are curiously silent in regard to the place there cannot be any doubt that the town rose to great importance in the later years of the four centuries of the Roman occupation of Britain." This sentence is quite long and could be clearer.

6. [SPELLING] "A glance at a map of the Roman roads in Kent shows Durovernum as a centre for five great ways leading from the coast towns of Portus Lemanis (Lymne), Portus Dubris (Dover), Portus Ritupis (Richborough, near Sandwich), Regulbium (Reculver), and also the Isle of Thanet, and from this important centre the Watling Street ran straight to Londinium." This sentence is very long and could be clearer.

7. [SPELLING] "These people, owning allegiance to various chiefs and living in camps or villages defended by earthen ramparts, were attacked by the Roman expeditions which invaded Britain in the opening years of the Christian Era, and there is evidence for believing that there was a British settlement of considerable importance on the site of Canterbury." This sentence is long and could be clearer.

8. [SPELLING] "Wherever any excavation has taken place in the heart of the present city, the foundations of Roman buildings with tesselated pavements and quantities of pottery, small objects of domestic use, and coins have been brought to light." This sentence is long and could be clearer.

9. [SPELLING] "These remains are all far beneath the present surface, a most significant fact in relation to the transition period between Roman and Saxon Canterbury." This sentence is clear but could be more concise.

10. [SPELLING] "The Romans having finally abandoned Britain early in the fifth century, the invasions of the Anglo-Saxons began to take a permanent form, and the Jutes gained possession of the south-eastern corner of England." This sentence is long and could be clearer.

11. [SPELLING] "During the period of struggle between the rival groups of invaders Durovernum must have been entirely abandoned by the Britons, and the conquerors, having reduced the city to a shapeless ruin, appear to have allowed it to become over-grown to such an extent that when, after a lapse of perhaps a whole century, the town was rebuilt, no attempt was made to dig down to the former surface." This sentence is very long and could be clearer.

12. [SPELLING] "The new buildings therefore arose with their foundations some feet above the original level of the Romano-British city." This sentence is clear but could be more concise.

13. [SPELLING] "So complete was the gap between the destroyed Durovernum and the Saxon town which eventually grew up that men had had time to forget the old name, and, finding it necessary to invent one, called it Cantwarabyrig, which meant the city of the men of Kent." This sentence is long and could be clearer.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from the 16th century to the Roman period without clear transition or context.

2. [LOGIC] The text mentions "a considerable literature on the Pilgrims' Way from Winchester" but doesn't provide context for why this is relevant.

3. [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses complex sentence structures that make it difficult to follow the logical flow.

4. [TRANSITION] The transition between discussing the 16th-century pilgrims and the historical background of Canterbury is abrupt.

5. [LOGIC] The text mentions "the tragic story" unfolding as one approaches Canterbury but doesn't clearly define what this tragic story is.

6. [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses archaic or formal language that can be confusing without context.

7. [STRUCTURE] The text moves from discussing the 16th century to the Roman period to the Saxon period without clear organization or chronology.

8. [LOGIC] The text mentions "the first view of the Cathedral city set in the midst of soft-swelling eocene hills" but doesn't clearly explain the significance of this view.

9. [LOGIC] The text discusses the "tragic story" but doesn't clearly define what this story is or how it unfolds.

10. [CLARITY] The text uses terms like "cosmopolitan groups of travel-soiled men and women" without clarifying what this means in the context of medieval pilgrimages.

11. [LOGIC] The text makes a comparison between modern pilgrims and Chaucer's pilgrims but doesn't fully develop this comparison or its significance.

12. [CLARITY] The text uses terms like "the most convenient, rapid, and comfortable method of travel then available" without clearly explaining what this means in the context of medieval travel.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several spelling and punctuation issues with the special characters (PalÃ¦olithic, CÃ¦sar). There are also some long and complex sentences that could be clearer. However, most of the text is generally readable with only minor issues. I would rate this as a 4. The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues in grammar or phrasing.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has some structural issues with abrupt transitions between different historical periods. The logical flow is generally good, but there are some places where the connections between ideas are not clear. The text sometimes jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions. I would rate this as a 3. The text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions.
