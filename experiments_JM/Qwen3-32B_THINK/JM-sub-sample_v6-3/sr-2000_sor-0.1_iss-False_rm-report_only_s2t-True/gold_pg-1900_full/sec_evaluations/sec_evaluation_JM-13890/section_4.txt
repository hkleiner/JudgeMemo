Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency Issues. The text is quite long, so I need to scan through it carefully.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "sumpter-mule" might be a typo; it's more commonly "sumpter mule" without the hyphen. Also, "Vespers had just begun when the murderers entered, but the singing of that service was never completed." There's a missing comma after "entered," which could be a syntax issue. 

Looking at grammar, there are a few instances where subject-verb agreement might be off. For example, "The monks hurried back, and Fitzurse, apparently calmed by their presence, resumed his statement..." The use of "calmed" might be a past participle that should be "calmed by their presence" is correct, but I need to check if the verb tense is right. Also, in the sentence "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate with the practices of medieval monasticism," the phrase "not easy to be believed" is awkward. It might be better as "not easy to believe."

In terms of syntax, the sentence structure is generally complex but mostly correct. However, there are some run-on sentences. For example, "Taking up such an attitude in front of four men who had come hot-foot to Canterbury with the express determination to seek an excuse for killing him, Becket was sealing his own fate." This is a long sentence that could be split for clarity. Also, the use of em dashes and commas might be inconsistent in some parts.

Now, moving to Coherence Issues. The text is a historical narrative, so coherence is about the logical flow and transitions between ideas. The narrative seems to jump between different events and time periods without clear transitions. For example, after describing Becket's murder, the text shifts to the monks' reaction and then to the relic trade. The transition between these sections is abrupt and could be confusing. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "Dean Stanley adds another fact..." refers to Dean Stanley, but it's not clear who he is in the context. If the reader isn't familiar with the reference, it might cause confusion. Additionally, the mention of "St. Augustine's" and the actions of Roger could be more clearly explained to maintain coherence. 

The text also includes some subplots, like the relic trade and the King's penance, which are connected but not always smoothly transitioned. The shift from the murder to the monks' actions and then to the relic trade feels abrupt. The logical progression isn't always clear, especially when moving from one event to another without clear cause-effect relationships. 

For the final scores, considering the fluency issues are minor and mostly spelling or punctuation, I'd say it's a 4.5. The coherence issues are more about transitions and some unclear references, so a 4 seems appropriate.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "Dean Stanley adds another fact not easy to be believed by those who have never become intimate..."  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence structure in "Taking up such an attitude... sealing his own fate."  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "entered" in "Vespers had just begun when the murderers entered, but..."

- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Becket's murder to the monks' relic trade subplot.  
- [TRANSITION] Unclear connection between the King's penance and the earlier narrative.  
- [CLARITY] Vague reference to "Dean Stanley" without contextual introduction.  
- [STRUCTURE] Subplots (e.g., relic trade, Roger's actions) feel disjointed from the main narrative.
