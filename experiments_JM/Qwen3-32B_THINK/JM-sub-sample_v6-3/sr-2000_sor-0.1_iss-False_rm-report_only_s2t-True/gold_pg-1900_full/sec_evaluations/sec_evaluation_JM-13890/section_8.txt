Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The user provided a text that's part of a historical description of Canterbury. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I'll look for any obvious grammatical errors. The text seems to be well-written with complex sentences, but maybe there are some issues. For example, "This glass is all prior to 1220" – "prior to" is correct, but maybe "before" could be simpler. However, it's not an error. 

Next, check for awkward phrasing. The sentence "For any description of the tombs of the archbishops there is, unfortunately, no space here." The structure is a bit passive. It might be clearer as "Unfortunately, there is no space here for any description of the tombs of the archbishops." But it's still understandable, so maybe a minor issue.

Spelling: I don't see any misspelled words. Words like "Perpendicular screenwork" and "Huguenot Chapel" are correctly spelled. 

Punctuation: Commas are used appropriately. For example, in "In the splendid crypt, besides the interest of the various periods of Norman and Transitional work, there is the rich Perpendicular screenwork..." the commas separate the introductory phrase correctly.

Word choice: Some phrases like "subsidiary to the careful drawing" – "subsidiary" might be a bit archaic, but it's correct. "Subservient to the careful drawing" is a bit awkward. Maybe "serves the careful drawing" would be better, but it's not incorrect.

Looking for syntax issues: The sentence "In Tudor times the whole of the undercroft was given up to the French Protestant refugees, who, besides worshipping there, set up their looms in this hallowed portion of the Cathedral where the martyr was laid until his translation in 1220 and where Henry II. had passed the night after his severe penance." This is a long sentence with multiple clauses. The structure is complex but grammatically correct. It might be a bit dense, but that's more about readability than fluency.

Another example: "This very short description of such a building must be regarded as a mere introduction to the study of a vast subject, for in the space available nothing more is remotely possible." The phrasing is a bit wordy, but again, not incorrect.

Overall, there are some minor issues with word choice and sentence structure, but no major grammatical errors. The text is mostly fluent, so a score of 4 seems appropriate. There are a couple of awkward phrasings but they don't significantly disrupt the flow.

Now for coherence. The text is a continuation of the historical description, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are abrupt transitions.

The first paragraph discusses the glass in the windows and the tombs. Then it moves to the crypt and its features. Next, it talks about the undercroft and the French refugees. Then it concludes with a summary of the description. The flow is logical, each paragraph transitions to the next topic smoothly.

However, there's a jump from discussing the undercroft to the French refugees. The sentence "In Tudor times the whole of the undercroft was given up to the French Protestant refugees..." might be a bit abrupt if the connection to the previous sentence isn't clear. But given the context of the cathedral's history, it's a logical progression.

Another point is the mention of Henry II. passing the night after his penance. This reference might be a bit out of place if the previous sentences don't set it up, but it's part of the historical context, so it's acceptable.

The last paragraph serves as a conclusion, summarizing the brevity of the description. The transition is smooth. There are no major coherence issues. The text maintains a clear progression, even though it's dense with information. The coherence score would be 4.5, as it's mostly coherent with very minor issues in transitions but nothing that disrupts the overall understanding.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "subsidiary to the careful drawing of the pictures in the medallions" (word choice). - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing in "must be regarded as a figure of speech" (somewhat outdated). - [STRUCTURE] Long, complex sentence in "In Tudor times... his severe penance" (dense but grammatically correct).  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from undercroft history to French refugees without clear linkage. - [CLARITY] Slightly abrupt mention of Henry II. in the undercroft context (assumes prior knowledge). - [STRUCTURE] Dense information clusters (e.g., crypt features) may overwhelm without clear segmentation.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
