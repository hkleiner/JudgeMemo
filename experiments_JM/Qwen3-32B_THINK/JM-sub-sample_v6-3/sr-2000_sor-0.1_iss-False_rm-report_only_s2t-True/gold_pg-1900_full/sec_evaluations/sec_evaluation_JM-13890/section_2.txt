Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. 

First, I'll look for grammar issues. The sentence "It was probably not until Ethelbert had begun to reign in 561 that Canterbury became..." uses a passive voice which might be a bit awkward, but it's not a major issue. There are some complex sentences, like the one about Ethelbert's power extending north to the Humber. The structure is a bit long but still understandable. 

Next, spelling. I notice "archÃ¦ologists" with an incorrect character (Ã) instead of "ae" which should be "archaeologists". That's a typo. Also, "St. Martin's" is consistently used, so that's okay. 

Word choice and phrasing: The phrase "the slow grinding of the wheels of Time" is a bit cliché and could be more original, but it's not a major problem. The text uses some archaic terms like "heathen" and "idol-place," which might be appropriate given the historical context. 

Punctuation: The sentence about the Danes' attack in 1011 is quite long and has commas that might need to be checked for clarity. For example, "Alphege, the good old archbishop, was obliged to witness..." uses commas correctly here. 

Now for coherence. The text discusses the history of Canterbury, focusing on its role in the Christianization of England. The flow is generally logical, moving from Ethelbert's reign, the arrival of Augustine, the construction of churches, and the later Danish attacks. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from the churches to the Danish attacks in 1011 is a bit sudden. 

There's a lot of information packed into the text, which could make it dense. The section about St. Martin's and the debate over its origins is detailed but might be confusing if the reader isn't familiar with the context. The mention of various churches and their dedications could be a bit disjointed. 

The text also references historical figures and events without always providing clear transitions. For instance, moving from Ethelbert's son Eadbald building a church to the Norman Conquest feels a bit abrupt. 

Overall, the fluency has minor issues like the spelling error and some complex sentences, but it's mostly readable. Coherence is good but could be slightly improved with smoother transitions between different historical events and details.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] Incorrect character in "archÃ¦ologists" (should be "archaeologists")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It was probably not until Ethelbert had begun to reign...")  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing ("the slow grinding of the wheels of Time")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between historical events (e.g., sudden jump from church construction to Danish attacks)  
- [LOGIC] Dense information clusters without clear transitions (e.g., multiple church dedications and timelines)  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between Ethelbert’s reign and later events (e.g., Eadbald’s church and Norman Conquest)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
