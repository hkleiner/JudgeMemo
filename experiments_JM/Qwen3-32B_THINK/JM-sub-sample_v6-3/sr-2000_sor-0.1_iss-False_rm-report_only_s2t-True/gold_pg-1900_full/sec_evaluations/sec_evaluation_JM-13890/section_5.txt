Alright, let me assess the text according to the given criteria.

# Fluency Issues:

Looking for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

- [GRAMMAR] "Henry was now quite absolved, but he remained for the whole night with his bare feet still muddy and in the same penitential garb." - This sentence is grammatically correct but has a slightly awkward structure.

- [GRAMMAR] "the King took to his bed, suffering from a dangerous fever, but a few days later, hearing from Richmond in Yorkshire that the Scots had been defeated and driven north, he recovered rapidly..." - This is a long, complex sentence with multiple clauses that could be more clearly structured.

- [GRAMMAR] "Not by that way only did the vast crowds reach Canterbury..." - This is an inversion that's somewhat awkward and less natural.

- [GRAMMAR] "The fire came, however, and the choir was to a great extent rebuilt..." - The placement of "however" is slightly awkward.

- [GRAMMAR] "He set to work soon after the fire; but, after four years of labour, was so much injured by a fall from the scaffolding that he was obliged to abandon his unfinished work and return to his native Normandy." - This sentence has an awkward structure with a missing subject after the semicolon.

- [GRAMMAR] "Upon an Englishman named William devolved the task of completing the work." - This is an unusual construction that's grammatically correct but awkward.

- [GRAMMAR] "When the reconstruction of Conrad's Norman choir began, the Gothic style was just beginning to appear--an incipient tendency towards a pointed arch here and there..." - The sentence structure is complex and could be clearer.

- [GRAMMAR] "And even if this dignity had not remained the position of the town in relation to the comings and goings between England and France would have saved it from any sudden fall from its opulence and greatness before the dissolution." - This is a very long sentence with multiple clauses that could be more clearly structured.

- [GRAMMAR] "To touch even lightly on the subsequent history of Canterbury is not possible here, but its remarkably interesting story has been woven into a connected narrative by Dr. Cox..." - The phrasing is somewhat awkward.

- [SPELLING] "Â£30" - This appears to be a formatting issue with the pound sign.

Overall, the text is quite fluent with only minor grammatical issues. The writing is formal and complex, which makes some sentence structures seem awkward, but the language is generally clear and well-written.

# Coherence Issues:

Looking for problems with logical sequencing, transitions, clarity, and overall structure:

- [LOGIC] The text jumps from Henry's penance to the arrival in London and then to the fire at the cathedral, which is a sudden shift in subject.

- [LOGIC] The text moves from the fire to the reconstruction efforts and then to the architectural styles, which is a logical progression but feels somewhat disjointed.

- [LOGIC] The text jumps from the completion of the cathedral to the translation of Becket's remains, which is a significant time jump with no clear transition.

- [LOGIC] The text moves from the translation ceremony to the ongoing pilgrimages and then to the decline of the cathedral, which is a logical progression but lacks smooth transitions.

- [LOGIC] The text shifts from the decline of the cathedral to the description of the city and cathedral in the present day, which is a significant temporal shift with no clear indication.

- [STRUCTURE] The text is very long and covers a wide range of topics (history, architecture, religious significance, etc.) without clear sectioning or organization.

- [CLARITY] Some sentences are very long and complex, making it difficult to follow the main ideas.

Overall, the text is generally coherent with a clear historical narrative. However, the wide range of topics and the many temporal shifts could make the text feel a bit disjointed at times. The writing is formal and complex, which contributes to the overall coherence but can also make some transitions feel abrupt.

# Final Scores:

FLUENCY: The text has only minor grammatical issues and is generally fluent. The complex sentence structures are somewhat awkward at times but don't significantly impact readability. I would give a score of 4.

COHERENCE: The text has a clear historical narrative but jumps between topics and time periods with only minimal transitions. These shifts could make the text feel a bit disjointed at times. I would give a score of 3.5.
