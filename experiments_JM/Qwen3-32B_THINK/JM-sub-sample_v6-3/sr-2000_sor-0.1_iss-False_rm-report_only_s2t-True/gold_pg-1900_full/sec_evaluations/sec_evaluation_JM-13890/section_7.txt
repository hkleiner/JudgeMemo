Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for **Fluency**. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. Scanning through the text, I notice a few places where the phrasing is a bit awkward or there might be minor grammatical issues. For example, "The effect of emptiness existing to-day is vastly different to what the pilgrims used to gaze upon..." – "existing to-day" might be a bit clunky, and "to what" is correct but could be smoother as "from what". Also, there are some run-on sentences or complex sentences that could be split for clarity. For example, the sentence about Archbishop Howley is quite long and could be broken up. There's a mention of "Crécy and Poitiers" with an accent on the é, which is correct but might be a typo if the original text didn't have it. Also, "CrÃ©cy" looks like a possible encoding error. Another instance is "St. Augustine's Chair must be regarded as a figure of speech" – the phrasing here is a bit awkward. There's also a missing last name for "Sir T. Hales" which might be a typo. 

Now for **Coherence**. The text is a detailed description of a cathedral and its history. I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are any abrupt transitions. The text moves from one section of the cathedral to another, which is logical, but there are some jumps. For example, after discussing the monuments in the nave aisles, it suddenly moves to the north-west transept, then to the undercroft, and then to various chapels and tombs. There are some references to prior sections (like "as already stated") which might be confusing if the context isn't known. Also, the mention of "the illustration facing p. 30" refers to a visual not present here, which might disrupt the flow. The part about Archbishop Howley and the Reform Bill is a bit of a tangent and could be seen as an abrupt shift. The text also has some historical comparisons (e.g., between Henry IV's tomb and the Black Prince) which are relevant but might not transition smoothly. There's a lot of information, which is good, but the sheer volume might make it feel a bit dense or disorganized in parts.

Considering the fluency issues, they are mostly minor and don't significantly disrupt reading, so a score around 4.5 might be appropriate. For coherence, the logical flow is generally good, but there are some abrupt transitions and references to external content, so a 4 seems suitable.
