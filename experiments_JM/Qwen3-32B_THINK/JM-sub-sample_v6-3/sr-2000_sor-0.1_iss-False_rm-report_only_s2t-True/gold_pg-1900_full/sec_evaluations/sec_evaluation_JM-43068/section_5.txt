Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency issues. I'll go through the current section and look for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice problems.

Looking at the first paragraph: "Freed from all encumbrances save poverty, Millet was now to work out his own destiny according to the dictates of his genius." That's a long sentence but seems okay. Next, "He joined a friend named Marolle, and the two together occupying a very small apartment endeavoured to eke out an existence." The phrase "the two together occupying" is a bit awkward. Maybe it should be "the two together occupied" or "occupying a very small apartment together." That's a syntax issue.

Then, "It was only too soon apparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not yet ready for development upon the lines his genius directed him, that his livelihood could not be secured..." The structure here is a bit convoluted. The use of "that young as he was, and the taste..." might be better as "that, young as he was and the public taste not yet ready..." This is a syntax problem again.

Another part: "In these straits he turned to portrait-painting, just as many great painters before and since him have done." The phrase "before and since him" is a bit awkward. Maybe "before and after him" would be smoother. That's a word choice issue.

Moving on to coherence. The text is about Millet's struggles and his journey. The flow seems logical, moving from his move to Paris, financial struggles, attempts to gain recognition, personal events like marriage, and eventual move to Barbizon. But I need to check for any abrupt shifts or unclear transitions.

The transition from Millet's time in Paris to his visit to Cherbourg and then to his meeting his first wife seems okay. However, the shift from discussing his painting subjects to his teaching offer in Cherbourg is a bit abrupt. The connection is there, but maybe a smoother transition would help. That's a structure issue.

Also, the part about the Council's reaction to the portrait and Millet's refusal of payment is clear, but the connection to his personal life with his wives could be better linked. It feels a bit disconnected. That's a transition issue.

Looking at the later part about his classical pictures and peasant subjects, the text explains his efforts to appeal to the public while still pursuing his own style. The progression is logical, but the mention of his teaching offer and subsequent return to Paris is a bit abrupt. Maybe a smoother transition would help here, which is a structure problem.

In the section about Rousseau and Millet's differences, the comparison is clear, but the transition from Millet's life to discussing their artistic differences is a bit sudden. It might be better if there was a sentence connecting their move to Barbizon with the discussion of their styles. That's a transition issue.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, with some minor issues in transitions and structure. For fluency, there are a few awkward phrasings and syntax issues, but nothing too severe. So I'd rate fluency around 4.5 and coherence around 4.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the two together occupying a very small apartment endeavoured..." (missing preposition/verb agreement).  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome structure in "It was only too soon apparent that young as he was, and the taste of the public being not yet ready..." (overly complex subordination).  
- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing in "before and since him" (better phrased as "before and after him").  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor inconsistency in "he was unable to obtain more than five to ten francs apiece" (missing "of" after "francs").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Millet’s financial struggles to his teaching offer in Cherbourg without clear transition.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from the Council’s portrait rejection to his personal life (first wife) without contextual linkage.  
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnect between Millet’s artistic efforts and the abrupt mention of Rousseau’s contrasting style in the final section.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
