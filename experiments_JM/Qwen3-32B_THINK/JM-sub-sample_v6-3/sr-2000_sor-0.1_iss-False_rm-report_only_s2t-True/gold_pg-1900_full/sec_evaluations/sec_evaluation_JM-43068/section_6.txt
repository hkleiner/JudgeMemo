Okay, let's start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section, which is about Millet's life in Barbizon and his artistic works. 

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice a few instances where the grammar might be off. For example, "The sums that he owed, small though they were, rendered him in constant fear of the brokers." The structure here is a bit awkward. Also, there's a sentence that says "The prices which Millet obtained for this series of remarkable works was fantastically small." The subject "prices" is plural, but "was" is singular. That's a subject-verb agreement error.

Looking at other parts, "It was he who acquired for 4000 francs the wonderful 'Peasant grafting a Tree'" – the placement of "for 4000 francs" might be a bit confusing. It should probably be "acquired the 'Peasant grafting a Tree' for 4000 francs." Also, "The latter, one of the most philosophical of Millet's pictures, which to-day is the principal attraction..." has a misplaced modifier. "To-day is" should be "is today" and the structure could be clearer.

There are some instances of awkward phrasing like "The country around Barbizon appealed to him irresistibly." It's okay, but maybe "The country around Barbizon was irresistibly appealing to him" would be smoother. However, the original is still understandable, so maybe it's a minor issue.

In terms of spelling, I don't see any obvious typos. Words like "ménage" and "brokers" are correctly spelled. The word "ménage" is a French term used correctly here. 

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative about Millet's life and works. The main idea is his life in Barbizon, his financial struggles, and his artistic achievements. The flow seems logical, moving from his time in Barbizon, financial issues, notable works, and later life. 

However, there are some transitions that could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing his financial struggles to the sale of "Angelus" and the subsequent ownership changes is a bit abrupt. The text jumps from his personal life to the detailed account of the painting's sales, which might confuse the reader if they're expecting a continuation of the financial struggles narrative.

Another point is the mention of Rousseau's assistance with the "Peasant grafting a Tree." The text introduces Rousseau here, but since the previous section mentioned Rousseau as a fellow artist, the connection is there. However, the transition from discussing Millet's own actions to Rousseau's intervention could be clearer. 

There's also a part where the text talks about Millet's later works and then suddenly shifts to his financial contract with speculators. The connection between his artistic output and the financial arrangement isn't clearly explained, which might make the sequence feel disjointed.

The text also includes a lot of specific details about the sale prices and ownership of his paintings. While these are relevant to his financial situation, the sheer number of details might overwhelm the reader and disrupt the narrative flow. The coherence could be improved by grouping related information or providing clearer transitions between different events.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent but has a few areas where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. The fluency has some minor grammatical issues but is generally clear. Based on the evaluation criteria, the fluency score would likely be a 4, as there are minor errors that don't significantly disrupt readability. Coherence might be a 4 as well, with some noticeable but not major issues in transitions and structure.
