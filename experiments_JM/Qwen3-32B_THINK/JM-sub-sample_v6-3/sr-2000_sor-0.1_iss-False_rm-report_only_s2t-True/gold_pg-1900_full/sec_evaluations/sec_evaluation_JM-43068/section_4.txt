Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll need to scan through it carefully.

First, looking for grammatical errors. I notice a few instances where the structure is a bit off. For example, "The decision at which Millet père had arrived was prompted by a drawing..." – the phrasing here is a bit awkward. Maybe "The decision Millet père made was prompted..." would be smoother. Also, "He prevailed upon Millet to leave his son with him..." – the use of "prevailed upon" is correct but a bit formal. Not a major issue, though.

Next, syntax and sentence structure. Some sentences are quite long, which might affect readability. For example, the sentence starting with "By means of his influence..." is a run-on. It could be split into shorter sentences for clarity. There are also some complex clauses that might be confusing. For instance, "All this occurred, however, without any breach of friendship occurring." The repetition of "occurring" is redundant. It should be "without any breach of friendship."

Spelling seems okay. I don't see any obvious misspellings. Word choice is mostly appropriate, though some phrases are a bit archaic, like "betwixt" which is old-fashioned. However, since the text is about historical figures, maybe that's intentional.

Now, coherence. The text is a narrative about Millet's life and struggles. The flow seems logical, moving from his family's support to his training under Mouchel, then to his return to the farm, and subsequent moves to Cherbourg and Paris. Each section transitions smoothly into the next. However, there are a few points where the connections could be clearer. For example, when discussing Millet's time in Paris and his admiration for various artists, the transitions between different artists and their influences are a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of Delaroche and the school of nature at the end might need a smoother transition from the previous discussion about his training.

There's also a part where it says, "He arrived to find the old man unconscious..." which is clear, but the following sentence about his father's death is a bit abrupt. Maybe a transition like "He arrived to find his father unconscious and passed away shortly after" would be better, but the current text is still understandable.

Overall, the text is well-structured and maintains a logical progression. The coherence is strong, with only minor issues in transitions between sections. For fluency, there are some awkward phrasings and complex sentences that could be simplified, but they don't significantly hinder understanding. I'll rate fluency a 4 and coherence a 4.5.
