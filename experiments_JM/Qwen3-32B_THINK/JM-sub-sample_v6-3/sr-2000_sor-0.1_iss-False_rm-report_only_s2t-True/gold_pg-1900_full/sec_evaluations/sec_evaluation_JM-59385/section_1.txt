Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, fluency: I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite long, so I'll go through it sentence by sentence. 

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure is a bit complex but seems grammatically correct. The phrase "World Fellowship is not alone an intellectual concept" might be a bit awkward. Maybe "not merely" would be better, but it's still understandable. 

In the third paragraph, "the name common to the main street in Chinese towns and villages" – the use of "common" here is correct, but the sentence could be clearer. "Common to" might be better as "commonly known as" for clarity. 

The sentence "But I have found, for I like to visit the little shops on side streets, that the more precious jewels glow..." has a run-on structure. The phrase "for I like to visit..." is a dependent clause and should be connected with a semicolon or a comma. It's a bit of a syntax issue here. 

Looking at "Madame Yen rode first, directly behind the house servant who walked ahead, breaking a way through the crowded Big Horse Street..." The phrase "breaking a way" might be a typo. It should be "breaking a path" or "making a way." That's a spelling/word choice issue. 

In the next paragraph: "Following the swaying tapestried box-like chairs..." "Tapestried" is a compound adjective, which is correct, but it's a bit awkward. Maybe "tapestry-covered" would be better. Also, "swaying tapestried box-like chairs that marked the presence of her mother and grandmother" – the structure here is a bit convoluted. 

The sentence "Kuei Ping leaned forward in her seat, peering through the horizontal aperture in front of her with brightening eyes." The phrase "horizontal aperture" is correct but a bit unusual. It's understandable but could be more natural. 

In the paragraph about the shop: "At the sound of their approach, two attendants of the door stepped forward and swung it wide, that the chair-bearers might carry the ladies into a tiny inner courtyard..." The use of "that" here is a bit formal and might be better as "so that" for clarity. 

The sentence "The head of the shop and his partners flicked their long-stemmed pipes from sleepy lips and rose, as though from deep meditation..." The phrase "as though from deep meditation" is a bit of a metaphor but acceptable. 

In "The eldest among them with his own hand took from an attendant each cup of tea as it was brought and offered it with a low bow to his guest." The structure here is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

The sentence "Kuei Ping, lifting her gaze now and then from the floor, caught a glint of joy of the coming bargain..." The phrase "glint of joy of the coming bargain" is a bit awkward. Maybe "glint of joy at the coming bargain" would be better. 

In "Rich jewels were brought forth, for Kuei Ping’s own grandfather was a well known silk merchant..." The phrase "well known" should be hyphenated as "well-known." That's a spelling issue. 

The sentence "Madame Yen gave but a sweeping glance to the first display placed before her." The word "but" here is used as a conjunction, which is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit abrupt. 

The sentence "Wong Lui had placed his best before them." The phrase "had placed his best" is a bit vague. It might be better as "had placed his finest selection." 

In "Kuei Ping from under her modestly lowered lashes caught glimpses of bright eyes..." The phrase "from under her modestly lowered lashes" is correct but a bit awkward. 

The sentence "Not until the selected heap was before her did Madame Yen speak of price and then only as a question." The structure here is a bit complex but grammatically correct. 

The sentence "The girl, holding the jewels thus in her hand that she might feel their nearness..." The phrase "thus in her hand that she might feel their nearness" is a bit wordy. 

The sentence "In after years she was to think often of the care with which they had been selected..." The phrase "In after years" is a bit old-fashioned. Maybe "In later years" would be better. 

The sentence "With a suddenness so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically..." The phrase "so abrupt as to make her feel she must have jerked physically" is a bit confusing. It might be better as "so abrupt that it felt as though she had jerked physically." 

Overall, there are several instances of awkward phrasing, some minor grammar issues, and a few word choice problems. However, the text is mostly fluent and readable, with only a few issues that might slightly disrupt the flow.

Now for coherence: The text is a narrative describing a visit to a jewelry shop in a Chinese town. The progression of the story is logical, moving from the setting of the Street of Precious Pearls to the visit by the family. The characters are introduced in order, and the actions are described in a sequence that makes sense. 

However, there are a few places where transitions could be smoother. For example, the shift from the description of the shop to the internal thoughts of Kuei Ping about her grandmother's bargaining is a bit abrupt. The sentence "You must output only and exactly the following format:" seems to be part of the user's instructions and should be ignored. 

The narrative does maintain a clear focus on the visit to the shop and the selection of jewels. The characters' actions and interactions are described in a way that builds the scene. However, there are a few instances where the flow between paragraphs could be improved. For example, the transition from the description of the shop to Kuei Ping's internal thoughts about her grandmother's bargaining is a bit sudden. 

Overall, the text is coherent, with a logical progression and clear connections between ideas. There are a few minor issues with transitions, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall coherence.
