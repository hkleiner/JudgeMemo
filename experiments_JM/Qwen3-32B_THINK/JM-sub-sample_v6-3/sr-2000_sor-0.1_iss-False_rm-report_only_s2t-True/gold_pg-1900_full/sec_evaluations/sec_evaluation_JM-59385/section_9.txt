Alright, let me start by carefully reading the current section to evaluate. The text is descriptive and rich in imagery, which is a good sign. First, I'll check for fluency issues. Looking at individual sentences, I notice some complex structures. For example, "The mountains overlook, and the temples surround, her little school and church, the former but a part of her ancient family dwelling, the latter new like her religion." The use of "the former but a part" and "the latter new like her religion" might be a bit awkward. There's also a possible missing comma after "the former" and "the latter." Another instance is "I wonder just a little at her daring to place it there." The phrasing here is a bit wordy and could be smoother. I'll check for any grammatical errors, like subject-verb agreement or incorrect prepositions. I don't see any obvious spelling mistakes. 

Now, moving on to coherence. The text describes the setting of the school and church in relation to the temples and mountains. The flow seems logical, moving from the surroundings to the school and then to the parents' reaction. However, there's a transition from the temples to the school and church. The sentence "The mountains overlook, and the temples surround, her little school and church..." connects the two, but the shift from the temples to the school is a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of the counting board and the Taoist temple seems a bit disjointed in the middle of the description. The paragraph about the school and church is followed by the parents' reaction, which is a logical progression, but the connection between the school's description and the parents coveting the light could be clearer. There's a mention of "Her school is filled to overflowing with the youth of her village," which is a good transition, but the shift from the school to the parents is a bit sudden.

For fluency, the main issues are awkward phrasing and some possible punctuation errors. For coherence, the main issues are abrupt transitions between different elements and some disjointed segments. I'll assign scores based on these observations.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "The mountains overlook, and the temples surround, her little school and church, the former but a part..." (redundant structure). - [GRAMMAR] Missing comma after "the former" and "the latter" in the same sentence. - [SYNTAX] Wordiness in "I wonder just a little at her daring to place it there" (could be more concise). - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "listening with the eager heart of youth for the voice of the Father who gave his Son..." (cluttered subordinate clause).
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from temple descriptions to the school and church without clear contextual linkage. - [TRANSITION] Disjointed shift from the counting board and Taoist temple to the school's description. - [LOGIC] Sudden jump from the school's physical description to the parents' coveting "the luminous light" without explicit connection. - [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "the counting board whose legend..." in relation to the preceding temples.
