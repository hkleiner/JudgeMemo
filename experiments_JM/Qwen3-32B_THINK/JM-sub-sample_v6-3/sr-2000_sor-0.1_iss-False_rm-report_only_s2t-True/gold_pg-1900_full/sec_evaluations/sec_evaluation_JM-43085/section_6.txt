Alright, I'll evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

First, let me understand the text. It appears to be a biography or memoir about the artist Meissonier, discussing his interactions with Napoleon III, his military service during a war, and his artistic philosophy and style.

Now, let me analyze for fluency issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] "A fine example of artistic perseverance and diplomacy,--greatly aided" - The use of double hyphens without proper punctuation is non-standard.
- [PUNCTUATION] "The morning after the Fourth of September, he besought the Minister of War, LÃ©on Gambetta, for an appointment as prefect in one of the departments that were either invaded or menaced." - The sentence is long but grammatically correct.
- [PUNCTUATION] "He spoke on many occasions of the incomparable pleasure that he found in directing 'those admirable machines,' which he defined as 'the stupidest of all intelligent animals.'" - Quotation punctuation is appropriate.
- [SPELLING] I don't notice any spelling errors.
- [SYNTAX] "Is it not because of this expressive relief both of figures and gestures that people were able to compare Meissonier to Marmot" - This complex sentence is grammatically correct.
- [SYNTAX] "But that in no way detracted from their beauty of form." - The sentence structure is clear.
- [LEXICON] "He used them not only as models but also for riding." - The word choice is appropriate.
- [PUNCTUATION] "Of this artistic virtue there are abundant examples. We have already cited one in the opening pages; we will cite another by way of conclusion" - The punctuation is appropriate.

Overall, the text is quite fluent with only minor punctuation issues that don't significantly affect readability.

Now, let me analyze for coherence issues:

**Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps from one topic to another (e.g., from Napoleon III to the artist's military service to his artistic philosophy). The transitions between these topics could be smoother.
- [LOGIC] The text discusses Meissonier's interactions with Napoleon III, his military service, and his artistic style, but the connections between these different aspects of his life aren't always clear.
- [TRANSITION] "Eleven years later--the year of terror--the artist..." - The transition from the earlier story about Napoleon III to the later events is somewhat abrupt.
- [COHESION] The text contains multiple topics (Meissonier's interactions with the Emperor, his military service, his artistic philosophy) that could be better organized or connected.
- [CLARITY] "Is it not because of this expressive relief both of figures and gestures..." - The sentence is complex but clear.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions Meissonier's military service, but the connection to his artistic career isn't clearly explained.
- [STRUCTURE] The text shifts from narrative to commentary on his artistic style without clear transitions.

The text is generally coherent but has some issues with transitions between different topics and could benefit from clearer connections between the various aspects of Meissonier's life and career.

Based on these analyses:

**Fluency Score:** 4.5 - The text is mostly fluent with only minor punctuation issues that don't significantly affect readability. The language flows well and is generally clear.

**Coherence Score:** 3.5 - The text is generally coherent but has some issues with transitions between different topics and could benefit from clearer connections between the various aspects of Meissonier's life and career. The structure could be improved to better connect the different sections.

Let me double-check these assessments to ensure they're accurate.
