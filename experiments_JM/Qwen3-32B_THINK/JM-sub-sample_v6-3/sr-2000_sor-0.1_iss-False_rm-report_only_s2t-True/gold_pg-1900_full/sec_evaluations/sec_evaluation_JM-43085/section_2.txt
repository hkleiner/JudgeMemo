Alright, I need to evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the current section carefully.

First, fluency. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The text is quite old, so maybe some archaic terms are used, but they should still be correct. Let me check each sentence.

In the first paragraph: "Yet it was not long afterwards, thanks to a dogged persistence, that the lad had overcome paternal opposition..." The phrase "dogged persistence" is a bit old-fashioned but still understandable. The sentence structure seems okay. 

Next: "Meissonier very shortly quitted this somewhat dull discipline..." "Quitted" is correct but less common than "quit." Maybe a minor issue, but acceptable in a historical context. 

"Yet during the four months that he remained under the guidance of the worthy author of The Four Seasons, it must be admitted that he laboured greatly to the profit of his art." The phrasing "laboured greatly to the profit of his art" is a bit awkward. Maybe "laboured greatly to his own profit in art" would be smoother. 

Moving on: "M. Phillippe Burty, his contemporary and his first biographer, explains to us that, while at Cogniet's, young Meissonier did not work like the other students..." The name "M. Phillippe Burty" should be "M. Philippe Burty" (missing 'h'). That's a spelling error. 

"He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt..." The list here is a bit long and could be clearer. Maybe a comma issue or a run-on sentence. 

"In the midst of this resurrection of a past that was still quite recent, in the very presence of the stage setting, the reproduction of the Napoleonic Epic..." The use of "resurrection" here is metaphorical but might be confusing. The sentence structure is complex but not incorrect. 

"He suddenly conceived of it as the greatest of all subjects that might tempt his accurate artist fingers." "Accurate artist fingers" is a bit awkward. Maybe "precise artist's touch" would be better. 

The next paragraph: "But while waiting to achieve his dream, he had to achieve a living." Repeated use of "achieve" is a bit redundant. "Make a living" would be more natural. 

"Be one's tastes never so modest, it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet..." The phrase "Be one's tastes never so modest" is archaic and might be confusing. A more modern phrasing would be "Even with the most modest tastes." 

"He shared his poverty light-heartedly with a chosen circle of friends..." The hyphenation in "light-heartedly" is correct. 

"He had to content himself with frequenting the Louvre." The phrasing is okay but a bit formal. 

"Unlooked-for windfall: in company with his friend Trimolet..." The colon is correctly used here. 

"Then, some religious figures and emblems of saints for certain publishers..." The transition "Then" might be better as "Then, they began creating..." to clarify the subject. 

"When only sixteen years of age, Meissonier exhibited for the first time." The phrasing is correct. 

"As a matter of fact his name appears in the Salon catalogue of 1834..." The comma after "1834" is missing. 

"In this picture one may find, I will not say in miniature (since all his paintings were destined to be contained in narrow limits) but in a youthful way..." The parentheses and structure are a bit complex but acceptable. 

"Is there any need of saying that the public failed to distinguish a work which did not sufficiently distinguish itself?" The repetition of "distinguish" is confusing. Maybe "did not stand out" would be clearer. 

"Not quite at the start, naturally; and the first instalment of illustrations..." The semicolon usage here is correct. 

"But he refused to be discouraged, and not long afterwards deliberately made his way to the celebrated art-publisher, Curmer." The phrasing is okay. 

"The publisher, rendered distrustful by so youthful and importunate a face, assured the young man..." The use of "importunate" is correct but might be less common. 

"At that time life-masks happened to be quite the rage: people had their faces moulded in plaster just as nowadays they sit for a photograph..." The colon is correctly used. 

"young Meissonier related, not without vanity, that on the preceding Sunday he had taken the mask of the Johannot brothers..." The phrase "not without vanity" is a bit awkward. 

"The proof of this is that M. Curmer accepted an invitation to go the following Sunday..." The phrasing is correct. 

"the publisher, a prey once more to his original distrust, entrusted him to begin with,--with just one of the special illustrations,--to re-engrave!" The double hyphen and structure are a bit confusing. 

"Meissonier acquitted himself brilliantly of this half-task..." The phrasing is correct. 

"But, on the other hand, he had an entire series to make for an edition, no less sumptuous, of The Indian Cabin..." The use of "on the other hand" is correct. 

"CHAPTER: FIRST SUCCESS" The chapter heading is correctly formatted. 

"And then, in the words of one of his contemporaries: 'The first rays of fame that caressed him streamed from those admirable and diminutive drawings...'" The quotation is correctly formatted. 

"The first step along the path of glory was taken,--and on that path the first step costs more than anywhere else." The hyphen usage is a bit off. 

"Henceforth, no more need of soliciting work; far otherwise." The semicolon is correctly used. 

"The artist still continued to do illustrating. Mention must be made of the drawings that he did for Frenchmen Painted by Themselves..." The phrasing is okay. 

"and later--here ends this chapter of his artistic career--the plates that served as illustrations for The Fallen Angel..." The em dashes are correctly used. 

Overall, the text has some minor grammatical issues, archaic phrasing, and a few awkward constructions, but nothing that severely hinders understanding. So for fluency, I might give a 4.5, but some of the issues could lower it to 4.

Now for coherence. I need to check the logical flow, transitions between ideas, and overall structure. 

The text starts with Meissonier overcoming his father's opposition to study art. Then moves to his time with different instructors, his financial struggles, and eventual success. The flow seems logical. Each paragraph transitions to the next topic smoothly. There are references to previous context (like the father's opposition mentioned in the context segment), but since the current section is evaluated on its own, those references are okay. 

The mention of specific events and works (e.g., the Salon catalogue, the edition of Paul and Virginia) is well-structured. The chapter heading "FIRST SUCCESS" is appropriate and summarizes the content. 

However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing financial struggles, the text jumps to the success with the edition of The Indian Cabin. The transition is a bit abrupt but not confusing. 

The use of quotes and anecdotes (like the life-masks) adds depth but might feel a bit disjointed if not properly connected. However, the text does a good job of weaving these in. 

The conclusion mentions the end of this chapter of his career, which is a clear transition. 

Overall, the coherence is strong with a clear progression of ideas and smooth transitions. There are a few minor issues with abrupt shifts, but nothing major. So a coherence score of 4.5 or 5. However, some parts might be a bit dense or require prior knowledge, which could lower it slightly to 4.5.
