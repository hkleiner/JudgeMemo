Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a long text about Meissonier's career and his paintings. I need to assess both fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. I'll scan through the text for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or spelling mistakes. The text is in English but seems translated or written by someone with a non-native speaker's touch. Let me check for any issues.

First paragraph: "But it will not do to linger too long over abstract polemics, when we are in the presence of a reality..." The sentence structure is a bit complex but grammatically correct. No obvious errors here.

Next, "In 1840 more pictures were sent to the Salon: a Reader, a Saint Paul, an Isaiah." The list uses commas and "an" correctly. 

Moving on: "They were life size, yet that did not prevent them from being dull and commonplace in execution." The flow is smooth. 

Then, "Doubtless, irritated by his critics, Meissonier had wished to prove that he also, if he wanted to, could paint according to the schools." The use of "also" here is a bit awkward. Maybe "he could also" would be better, but it's still understandable. 

"Even the artists who are surest of themselves sometimes come to these hasty and impatient determinations." The phrase "come to these hasty and impatient determinations" is a bit clunky but not incorrect. 

"Fortunately for him, he made a bad showing..." "Fortunately" should be "Fortunately." That's a spelling error. 

"The young artist--he was at that time only twenty-five--was awarded a third-class medal." The em dashes are used correctly here. 

"The Game of Chess, won him a brilliant triumph: it was purchased by M. Paul Périer." The comma before "won" is unnecessary. It should be "The Game of Chess won him..." without the comma. 

"which at that time was considerable." The relative clause is correctly placed. 

"He had learned to give to every face that profundity..." The structure is a bit awkward but still makes sense. 

"the prodigious anxiety to give to every one of his personages such play of physiognomy..." Again, the phrasing is a bit wordy but not incorrect. 

"Those among Meissonier's contemporaries who had assured taste..." "Assured" here is probably a typo. It should be "assured" meaning confident, but "assured" is correct. Wait, no, "assured" is correct. Maybe "assured taste and artistic insight" is okay. 

"Take, for example, a Smoker!" The exclamation mark is appropriate here. 

"Close at hand, upon a table with spiral legs, he has placed side by side a flagon and a pewter-lidded tankard of beer." The sentence is a bit long but still flows. 

"Even the background, if we consult it, gives further enlightenment." The phrase "if we consult it" is a bit unusual but not incorrect. 

"apropos of an artist whose brush always had something in common with his pen." "Apropos" is misspelled. It should be "à propos" but in English, it's "apropos." Wait, the correct spelling is "à propos," but in English, it's often written as "apropos" without the accent. So maybe that's okay. 

Overall, there are a few spelling errors like "Fortunately" and maybe some awkward phrasing, but the text is mostly fluent. I might give a 4 for fluency, considering the minor issues.

Now for coherence. The text discusses Meissonier's career, his paintings, and quotes critics. The flow is logical, moving from his early works to his success, and includes quotes from critics. 

The transition between paragraphs is smooth. Each paragraph builds on the previous one, discussing different aspects of his work and reception. 

However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing the Game of Chess, the text jumps to the Park at Saint-Cloud without a clear transition. Also, the quote from Théophile Gautier is a bit long and might disrupt the flow if not properly introduced, but it's well-integrated here. 

The structure is mostly clear, with a logical progression from his early struggles to his later success. The use of specific examples (paintings, critics' opinions) supports the narrative. 

I don't see any major coherence issues. The text is well-organized and flows logically. Maybe a 5 for coherence.
