Alright, let's take a look at this text. It seems like a detailed description of a monastery and the surrounding area. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The first thing I notice is that the sentences are quite long and complex. There are a lot of commas and clauses, which might affect readability. For example, in the first paragraph: "Around the temple walls some dozens of houses, were grouped the majority of them low and of the most unpretentious description." The comma placement here is off, making it a bit awkward. That's a syntax issue. I'll need to check for other instances of misplaced commas or run-on sentences.

Next, there's some inconsistent use of terms. For instance, "t'umu" is introduced but not clearly defined, which might confuse readers. Also, the term "K'anglungssu" is repeated, but the lack of italics or quotation marks might be a formatting issue. However, the user said not to correct, just note the issues. So maybe that's a lexicon or clarity problem?

Looking for grammar errors. The sentence "Some blankets, a fur-coat, cups, basins, a jar for coal and a couple of chests, or cupboard-like boxes, is all that is to be seen in the way of household goods." The subject is plural (blankets, coat, cups, etc.), but the verb is "is," which is incorrect. That's a grammar issue. There are other instances like this where subject-verb agreement is off.

Spelling seems okay, but there are some odd words like "t'umu" which might be a transliteration. Not sure if that's a spelling error or just a proper noun. Probably not a spelling issue then. 

Now, coherence. The text is descriptive and follows a logical structure, moving from the temple area to the houses and then to the surrounding landscape. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after describing the temple, it jumps to the lamas and their practices without a smooth transition. That's a transition issue. Also, the mention of "Ma-t'idu" and "Rentshen Nurbo" might be confusing if the context is not clear from the previous section. Since the user mentioned the text is part of a longer document, but we have to evaluate it on its own, these names might not be explained here, leading to clarity issues.

Another coherence problem is the detailed description of the temple and its decorations. While it's thorough, the lack of clear organization might make it hard to follow. For example, the description of the four walls and the central square is quite technical and could be confusing without a visual aid. That's a structure or clarity issue.

There's also a shift from describing the monastery to the lamas' living conditions and their practices, then to the author's departure. The flow here is logical, but some parts might feel disconnected. The transition from the lamas' daily life to the author's farewell could use a smoother link.

Overall, the text is quite detailed and informative, but the long sentences and complex structures might affect fluency. For coherence, while the overall structure is there, some parts could be more clearly connected. I'll need to list the most significant issues for each category and assign scores accordingly.
