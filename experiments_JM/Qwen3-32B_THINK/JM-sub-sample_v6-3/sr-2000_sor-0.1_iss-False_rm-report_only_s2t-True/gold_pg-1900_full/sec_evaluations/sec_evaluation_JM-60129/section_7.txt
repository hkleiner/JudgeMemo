Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the fluency and coherence of the current section. The user provided a long text about the Yögurs, their history, customs, and administrative divisions. 

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling mistakes, or issues with word choice. The text is quite dense and academic, so some complex sentences might be tricky. For example, "To this desolate country, where wild beasts began to thrive in startling numbers, were sent..." has a passive voice that might be a bit confusing. Also, "by the command of the emperors they had been quite exterminated" – "quite exterminated" sounds a bit off, maybe "thoroughly" would be better. There's also a possible typo: "a kind ol Governor General" should be "a kind of Governor General". The phrase "six tshi Huang-fan from the district of Urumtchi" – "tshi" might be a term, but it's not clear if it's spelled correctly. 

Looking at the administrative divisions, there are a lot of terms in Chinese and Yögur, which might be challenging for fluency. The use of parentheses and dashes could be inconsistent. For example, "Chiangch'un (a kind ol Governor General)" – the "ol" is likely a typo for "of". Also, in the list of "bones", the formatting is inconsistent with some entries having semicolons and others not. The sentence structure in some parts is complex and might be hard to follow, like the long sentences in the customs section. 

Now, coherence. The text moves through different topics: historical background, population changes, administrative divisions, and customs. The transition between these sections is abrupt. For example, after discussing the extermination of a tribe, the text jumps to the administrative division of the Shera Yögurs without a clear transition. The structure of the administrative divisions is a bit confusing with the mix of Chinese and Yögur names and the lists. The list of "bones" is presented without much explanation, making it hard to follow. The section on customs starts with burial practices and then moves to inheritance and marriage, but the flow between these topics isn't smooth. The mention of lamas and their role in various rituals is consistent, but the connection between the different customs isn't clearly laid out. 

In the marriage customs section, the process is detailed, but the transition from the engagement to the wedding day is a bit jumpy. Also, the description of the wedding procession and the subsequent events could be more logically sequenced. The text uses a lot of specific terms without definitions, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context. The repetition of terms like "t'umu" and "t'idu" without prior explanation could be a coherence issue. 

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with typos and awkward phrasing, but the text is generally readable. Coherence is affected by abrupt transitions and lack of clear explanations for certain terms and sections. The administrative division part is particularly dense and could be confusing without prior knowledge. The customs section is more coherent but still has some structural jumps.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "By the command of the emperors they had been quite exterminated" (awkward phrasing; "quite" is imprecise).  
- [SPELLING] "a kind ol Governor General" (misspelled "of").  
- [SYNTAX] "To this desolate country, where wild beasts began to thrive in startling numbers, were sent..." (passive construction disrupts flow).  
- [LEXICON] "six tshi Huang-fan" (unclear term "tshi" without definition).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of parentheses and dashes in lists (e.g., "Harban tabyn golma) "    "   " of Kanglungssu").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from historical extermination of a tribe to administrative divisions of Yögurs without contextual linkage.  
- [CLARITY] Lists of "bones" and administrative divisions lack explanations for abbreviations (e.g., "t'umu") or their significance.  
- [LOGIC] Jump between burial customs, inheritance rules, and marriage practices without clear thematic progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from describing "bones" to administrative tax divisions ("Chinese names indicate the number of horses...") with no introductory link.  
- [CONSISTENCY] Repeated terms (e.g., "t'idu," "t'umu") appear without prior definition or cross-referencing.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
