Alright, let me go through the text and evaluate it for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "Say, you ain't got no call to worry about that part of it--there's where my troubles begin," returned Bud. The phrase "ain't got no call" is grammatically incorrect; it should be "ain't got any call" or "have no call."
2. [GRAMMAR] "Go on, now! Do as I tell you, or damned if I don't lick you and make you take 'em!" The phrase "damned if I don't" is a contraction that is not clearly written and could be confused with "damned if I do."
3. [SPELLING] "animile" - This is a misspelling of "animal."
4. [GRAMMAR] "You bet cher life" - "cher" is a phonetic spelling of "your," which is acceptable for dialogue but should be consistent with the character's dialect throughout.
5. [GRAMMAR] "nail him!" - This is a non-standard expression that doesn't clearly convey the intended meaning.
6. [GRAMMAR] "the buckskin pony was off with a snort and a splashing of gravel as the irons touched his sides" - The phrase "splashing of gravel" is awkward and doesn't clearly describe the action.
7. [GRAMMAR] "He drew back as the buzzing engine passed him, with something like awe." - The phrase "something like awe" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
8. [GRAMMAR] "The people coming and going, the traffic of the stores, the dwellings with small cultivated plots around them warmed Jim like a fire." - The sentence is a bit long and could be broken up for better clarity.
9. [GRAMMAR] "He found, when he began to speculate on the possibilities of the throng before him, that he was more interested in those whose all was staked on the trip, than in those to whom it was only an excursion." - The phrase "whose all was staked" is a bit awkward and could be clearer.
10. [GRAMMAR] "He was wonder-stricken at the sight, and felt an instinctive sympathy for the fugitive." - "Wonder-stricken" is not a standard word; it should be "wonderstricken" or "stricken with wonder."

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The transition from Bud giving Jim the burro to the scene at the train station in Plattsburg is abrupt. There's no clear explanation of how Jim got to Plattsburg or how much time has passed.
2. [LOGIC] The shift from the dialogue with Bud to Jim's experience at the train station is not smooth. The narrative doesn't clearly connect these two scenes.
3. [LOGIC] The introduction of the small boy at the train station seems to come out of nowhere. There's no prior setup or explanation for this character.
4. [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of the burly man and the boy's fear is not clearly connected to the previous narrative. There's no clear reason why the boy is fleeing or who the man is.
5. [LOGIC] The boy's dialogue is somewhat disjointed and doesn't clearly establish the relationship between the boy and the man or the context of their conflict.
6. [LOGIC] The resolution of the boy's situation (being hidden by Jim) is abrupt and not fully explained. The consequences of this action are not clear.

**Fluency Score:**
The text contains several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some misspellings. These issues are noticeable but don't completely disrupt the readability of the text. The dialogue uses phonetic spellings to convey dialect, which is appropriate for the genre but contributes to some grammatical irregularities. I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The text is generally readable, but the issues with grammar and phrasing do interrupt the flow to some extent.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has several logical issues with transitions between scenes and the introduction of new characters. The narrative jumps from one scene to another without clear connections, making the overall flow of the story somewhat disjointed. The introduction of the boy at the train station and his conflict with the man is not well-integrated into the narrative. I would rate the coherence as a 3. The text is generally coherent, but the abrupt transitions and lack of clear connections between scenes affect the overall reading experience.
