Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence using the given criteria. 

First, I need to check for fluency issues. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and how smoothly the sentences flow. Let me scan through the text.

I notice some spelling errors. For example, "scart" instead of "scared," "t'ree" for "three," and "dere" instead of "there." There are also instances of non-standard dialect like "cuddent" instead of "couldn't." These are part of the dialogue and might be intentional to show the characters' speech, but in terms of standard English, they're errors. However, if the author is using dialect for character, it's a stylistic choice. But according to the fluency criteria, these could be considered errors unless the dialect is part of the intended style. The instructions don't mention considering dialect, so I'll treat them as spelling issues.

Looking at sentence structure, there are some run-on sentences and missing commas. For example, "He turned to the tense little face before him for help, and with an admiration that knew no bounds." The sentence ends with a period after "bounds," but the next line is a new sentence. That's okay. However, some sentences might be awkwardly phrased. For instance, "The mail-rider drew out paper and tobacco, and rolled a cigarette. It was his method of biting his hand." The transition between these sentences is a bit abrupt, but it's clear.

Now, coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and how ideas are connected. The text is a narrative, so I need to check if the events follow logically. The story is about rescuing someone from a collapsed tunnel. The characters' actions and dialogues seem to connect. However, there are some transitions between paragraphs that might be abrupt. For example, after the rescue, the text shifts to Captain Hanrahan's party. The connection is made through the boy's ride, but the transition is a bit sudden. Also, some sentences might be confusing. For example, "The captain caught him as he fell. 'Poor little cuss! He rid hard to help his pardner!'" The shift from the captain catching the boy to his comment is clear, but the use of "rid" instead of "rode" is a spelling issue but also affects clarity.

Another point is the use of dialogue tags and punctuation. For example, "Bud leaped from his horse. 'Never you mind, Chessy lad!' he cried, hugging up the little figure..." The dialogue is properly punctuated, but some sentences might be a bit long. However, in narrative prose, this is acceptable.

Looking at the structure, the text is a continuous narrative with a clear progression of events. The coherence seems mostly intact, though there are a few places where the flow could be smoother. The use of dialect might make some parts harder to follow, but that's part of the characters' speech and not necessarily a coherence issue.

In terms of repetition or redundancy, I don't see much. The story moves forward without unnecessary repetition. However, there are some phrases that could be more concise. For example, "the good Lord kept you from getting hurt in the tunnel, perhaps He'll see you through again." This is a bit wordy but not redundant.

So, for fluency, the main issues are spelling errors (dialect), some awkward phrasing, and possible punctuation issues. For coherence, the main issue might be the abrupt transitions between some paragraphs, but overall the narrative is logical and connected.

Now, applying the scales. For fluency, if there are several spelling errors but the text is mostly understandable, it might be a 3 or 4. Since the dialect is part of the characters' speech and not all errors are standard mistakes, maybe some are intentional. However, the instructions don't specify considering dialect, so I have to treat them as errors. There are multiple spelling and grammar issues, which would lower the score. Let's say a 3 for fluency.

For coherence, the narrative is mostly logical with some abrupt transitions but overall coherent. Maybe a 4. The story flows well despite the transitions, and the connections between events are clear.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SPELLING] "scart" (should be "scared")
- [SPELLING] "t'ree" (should be "three")
- [SPELLING] "dere" (should be "there")
- [SPELLING] "cuddent" (should be "couldn't")
- [SPELLING] "rid" (should be "rode")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Bud's decision to send Ches to the detailed description of the rescue team's journey without clear narrative connection
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent time references between Bud's decision and the arrival of the rescue team
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from the rescue team's arrival to the medical assessment of Jim

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
