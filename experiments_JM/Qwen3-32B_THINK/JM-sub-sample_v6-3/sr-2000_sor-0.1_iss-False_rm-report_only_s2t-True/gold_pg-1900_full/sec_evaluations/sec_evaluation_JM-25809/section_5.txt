Alright, let me take a close look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section, ignoring the previous context. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me go through the text line by line.

First sentence: "Then he wondered what Anne would say to the adoption, or rather what advice she would give, for he felt entirely sure of her broad humanity, outside of their one difference." The phrasing here seems a bit long, but it's grammatically correct. Maybe a comma splice? Let me check. The sentence is complex but not incorrect.

Next: "He felt the need of her practical sense." "Need of" is correct here, though "need for" is more common. But it's not a major issue.

"Soon he had drifted into thinking of Anne entirely." "Drifted into thinking of Anne entirely" – the word order is a bit awkward. Maybe "entirely drifted into thinking of Anne" would be better, but the current phrasing is still understandable.

"Not bitterly now, but with a steady longing." This is okay. 

"The gray light of the waning moon, sifting through the boughs, was the true lumina for reverie." "Lumina" is the plural of "lumen," which refers to light. Using it here is a bit unusual but not incorrect. It adds a poetic touch.

"Why had he not answered her letter? Perhaps by this time-- What was that moving in the grass?" The em dash is used correctly here. 

"He threw up his right hand in a threatening gesture, to frighten the intruder away." The phrasing is clear. 

"Instantly he got his answer, and an icy wind seemed to ruff his hair--that insistent, dry, shrilling sound..." "Ruff" is likely a typo for "ruffle." That's a spelling error. 

"Jim thought quick and hard, with chills and fever coursing over him ad libitum." "Ad libitum" is a Latin term meaning "at one's discretion," but here it's used in a context that doesn't fit. The phrase "ad libitum" is usually used in scientific contexts, not for describing physical sensations. This is a misuse of the term. 

"He managed to slip his arm out without disturbing the sleeper. But now! There wasn't a club around except the short sticks of the fire." The exclamation "But now!" is a bit abrupt but acceptable in dialogue or internal monologue.

"A two-foot stick is not the proper equipment for rattler hunting, except to those born with nerves so strong that they do not hesitate to catch Mr. Crotalus by the tail and snap his head off." The phrasing is a bit complex but still clear.

"He thought of the rope he had used for a cinch, and made for it with his eye on the snake, lest the latter should approach closer to the boy." The use of "lest" is correct here.

"With a deep thankfulness for the heft of the rope, he returned and struck with all the strength of his big body, and pounded away in a sort of crazy rage, although the first stroke had done the business." The sentence is long but the structure is okay.

"He snapped the sweat from his brow as he looked down at the still writhing reptile." "Snapped the sweat" – this is a bit odd. Maybe "wiped the sweat" would be more common, but it's not incorrect.

"My God! What might have happened if the boy hadn't waked me?" he thought. The superstition of the miner rose in him rampant. "I believe that kid's going to bring me good luck," he said. "Darned if I don't. Well, I could stand some." The dialogue is clear, though the transition from internal thought to dialogue could be smoother.

"He took up the body of the rattler on a stick and heaved it far away, then lit his pipe." The comma splice here is minor but acceptable in narrative.

"I don't think I care for any more sleep to-night," laughed. "Like Ches, it ain't that anything will hurt me out here, but I'm everlastingly scared." The dialogue is okay.

"He watched the night out, revelling in his enjoyment of the mystery of the coming morning..." The phrasing is a bit wordy but not incorrect.

"The sun hung on the sharp point of Old Dog-Tooth like a portent, before he woke the boy." The metaphor is clear.

"Ches was all amazement for a second; then he gave a glad cry." The transition is smooth.

"Gee! Yer still here, ain't yer? No pipe in dis." "Dis is a reg'lar teeayter uf er place, ain't it?" The dialogue uses dialect, which is appropriate for the character.

"Dis is der scene where der villun almost gits der gent wid der sword, if der stage mannecher didn't send sumun ter help 'im out." The spelling and grammar here are part of the dialect, so it's intentional and acceptable.

"Jim laughed at the sophisticated infant. "You don't believe in the theater much, then, Ches?" "Aggh!" replied Ches. "If it ain't seven it's 'leven on der stage--but it's mostly craps in der street." Again, dialect is used appropriately.

The rest of the dialogue and narrative continue with similar dialect and phrasing. The only major fluency issues I found are the misspelling of "ruff" and the misuse of "ad libitum." There are some awkward phrases, but they don't significantly disrupt the flow. 

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative with a clear progression. The events are logically sequenced: Jim's thoughts about Anne, the snake encounter, the conversation with Ches, and the discovery of the mountain lion. The transitions between these events are smooth. The dialogue and internal monologue are well-integrated into the narrative. There are no abrupt shifts or confusing segments. The ideas are connected and build upon each other, maintaining a coherent storyline. The only minor issue might be the sudden shift from the snake to the mountain lion, but it's part of the story's progression and not confusing. The overall structure is clear and the narrative flows logically.

So, for fluency, there are a couple of minor issues, but overall the text is mostly fluent. For coherence, the text is highly coherent with a clear progression.
