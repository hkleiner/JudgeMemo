Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [PUNCTUATION] The phrase "By Jimminy" appears to be a colloquial expression with an unusual spelling that might be distracting to some readers.
2. [SPELLING] "coöperation" contains a diæresis mark that is unconventional in modern English spelling.
3. [PUNCTUATION] The chapter headings "CHAPTER: TEACHERS' MEETINGS" and "CHAPTER: MEETING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD" are followed by paragraphs without any clear paragraph breaks or formatting distinction.
4. [PUNCTUATION] Some long sentences could be improved with better punctuation or broken up for clarity (e.g., the sentence starting with "I thanked him for the invitation and assured him that I should be glad to attend the meeting").
5. [PUNCTUATION] The list of classics in the English teachers' section could use better formatting to distinguish the items more clearly.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions (e.g., from the initial paragraph about leaving the building to the anecdote about the teacher's comment).
2. [LOGIC] The narrative sometimes lacks clear logical connections between ideas (e.g., the transition from the anecdote about the superintendent who failed to the author's own approach).
3. [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin abruptly without connecting to the previous content (e.g., the paragraph starting with "One of the best talks I ever heard delivered by a superintendent").
4. [ORGANIZATION] The text has multiple examples and anecdotes that could be better organized to support a clearer central argument.
5. [COHERENCE] The text mixes different types of content (personal experience, general advice, specific examples) without always maintaining a clear focus.

Based on these observations:

For Fluency: I would give a score of 4. The text is mostly fluent with only a few minor issues in spelling and punctuation that don't significantly disrupt readability.

For Coherence: I would give a score of 4. The text is generally coherent with logical progression, but has some noticeable abrupt shifts and could benefit from clearer transitions between ideas.

Let me double-check these assessments:

The text is well-written overall with clear structure and logical flow. The author presents ideas in a reasonable sequence and provides examples to support his points. However, there are a few places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother, and some paragraphs could benefit from clearer connections to the surrounding content.

The fluency is good with only minor issues that don't interfere with understanding. The coherence is also good but has a few areas where the flow could be improved.

My final assessment is:
1) Fluency Score: 4
2) Coherence Score: 4
