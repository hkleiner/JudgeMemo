Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency Issues. The text is quite long, so I need to scan for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or punctuation problems. 

First, I notice some sentences that are a bit long and could be split for clarity. For example, "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted in the field of education." The structure here is a bit complex, but it's grammatically correct. However, the use of "drawing to a close" might be a bit archaic. Still, it's not a major issue.

Next, there's a part where it says, "He reported that he could not use a teacher to instruct young men and women in commercial work who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" The em dash is used here, which is acceptable, but maybe a comma would be better. Also, the phrase "one of the first requisites of business" is a bit awkward. It should probably be "one of the first requisites of business is 'dress sense.'" But the original is still understandable.

Looking at other parts, there are some instances where the subject and verb agreement might be off. For example, "A teacher should always be desirous of making a good personal impression, yet I have seen young women..." The verb "have seen" is correct here. 

I also check for spelling errors. Words like "coöperation" with the umlaut are correct in some contexts but might be replaced with "cooperation" in modern usage. However, the original text uses it, so it's not an error in the context of the text's style.

In terms of syntax, most sentences are well-structured. There's a sentence that says, "Specializing in one or more subjects based upon a fragmentary educational foundation is the cause of many failures in the teaching profession." The structure is a bit complex but still clear. 

Now, moving on to Coherence Issues. The text discusses various aspects of teacher preparation and application processes. The flow seems logical, but there are some transitions that could be smoother. For instance, the shift from discussing attire to the need for general education is a bit abrupt. However, the author does connect these ideas by emphasizing the importance of preparation.

Another point is the example about the young man and woman applicants. The contrast between their motivations is clear, but the transition from one example to the next could be more seamless. However, the narrative does hold together.

There's also a part where the author talks about their own experience as a superintendent. The transition from the general advice to personal anecdotes is handled well, but some sections might be repetitive in emphasizing the importance of education and preparation.

Overall, the text maintains a clear progression on the topic of teacher qualifications and preparation. The examples provided support the main points, though some could be more tightly integrated. However, there are no major coherence issues that disrupt the flow significantly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "He could not use a teacher [...] who lacked one of the first requisites of business--'dress sense.'" (Awkward phrasing with unclear antecedent for "one of the first requisites").  
- [SYNTAX] "Specializing in one or more subjects based upon a fragmentary educational foundation is the cause of many failures..." (Cumbersome structure).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes (e.g., "business--'dress sense'") without consistent style.  
- [LEXICON] "Coöperation" (non-standard spelling with umlaut).  

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from attire to "mediocre preparation" without transitional link.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on "general education" and "specialization" without clear progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from anecdotes about applicants to the author’s personal experience as a superintendent.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
