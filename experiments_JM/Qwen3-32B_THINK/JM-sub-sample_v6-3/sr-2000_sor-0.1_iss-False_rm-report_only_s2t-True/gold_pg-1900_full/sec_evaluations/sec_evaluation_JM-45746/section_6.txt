Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. I'll go through each paragraph and look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

First paragraph:
- "Before leaving that afternoon, he met me in the lower hall and said it was not customary to keep the office cleaned during the summer, but if I intended to be at the building again before the school opened, he would sweep it out." This sentence is a bit long but grammatically correct. The structure is a bit complex but flows well.
- "I told him that I had a few things that I should like to do during the two weeks' interval before the opening of school, and would probably be at the building daily, but I could easily look after the cleaning of the office during that time." Another long sentence, but it's clear and grammatically correct.
- "He looked at me with some astonishment. I don't know whether it was due to the statement that I expected to have something to do at the building for two weeks before school opened, or because I was willing to clean the room." The use of "I don't know whether" is a bit informal, but it's acceptable in narrative prose.
- "He said nothing and, with a 'good evening,' we parted at the end of the first day--with the question of coöperation or no coöperation somewhat unsettled in the janitor's mind." The use of "coöperation" with a double 'o' is archaic but not incorrect. The em dash is used correctly here.

Second paragraph:
- "When I reported for work the next morning the office had been thoroughly cleaned, which I considered quite a victory." The sentence lacks a comma after "next morning," which is a minor punctuation issue.
- "As the janitor did not make his appearance during the forenoon, I went in search of him to inquire about some record books." This is a complex sentence but grammatically correct.
- "He then proceeded to tell me what he thought of the teachers and superintendents in general and how I would do well if I could find anything, and showed me a closet in a teacher's room that was filled with a pile of books, supplies, and record sheets." The sentence is long but well-structured.
- "I listened to what he had to say, and then suggested that it might be well if we put some shelves in the closets, and arranged all the books and supplies in an orderly manner before the teachers reported for work." This is a complex sentence but grammatically correct.
- "I told him I was interested in what the closets contained, and if he would build some shelves, I would do the rest." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "He was sure that the shelves would do no good, and that his time and mine would be wasted." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "We said nothing more about it at that time, but the next day I started on a closet-cleaning crusade." The phrase "closet-cleaning crusade" is a bit hyperbolic but acceptable in narrative.
- "I do not know when I have received greater value for the time spent." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "Two days of work gave me an educational and business insight into the school that was invaluable." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "I learned the courses of study and the texts that were used in all of the grades." This is a clear and direct statement.

Third paragraph:
- "After three days' delay, the janitor decided that I had done a fairly good job, and that he would put in the shelves." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "I gave him some assistance and the books and supplies were listed, recorded, and put into place." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "This work was appreciated by the teachers, even though we had entered their private domain, and, I dare say, gave them a feeling that good housekeeping would be expected throughout the year." The use of "I dare say" is a bit informal but acceptable in narrative.

Fourth paragraph:
- "The janitor had now learned to know me fairly well. He found that we could work together, and by the time that school opened we were quite friendly." These are clear and direct statements.
- "I was amused some months later when a teacher told me of the account the janitor had given her and the other teachers at the opening of school, of the new superintendent." The sentence is a bit long and could be clearer, but it's still understandable.
- "When I reported at the end of the year the splendid services the janitor had rendered, the members of the board were so well pleased with the change in 'Rosy' that they raised his salary for the ensuing year." The sentence is a bit long but grammatically correct.
- "I am not sure but that the raise in salary pleased me more than it did him." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "The help that I received from this janitor throughout the year is no exception to the general rule." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "I do not wish to give the impression, however, that all the janitors with whom I have worked have been efficient, but I do wish to say that I have received from each of them a much greater degree of coöperation when I caused him to feel that I was his co-worker and not his boss." This is a complex sentence but grammatically correct.

Fifth paragraph:
- "The help that I received from this janitor throughout the year is no exception to the general rule." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "I do not wish to give the impression, however, that all the janitors with whom I have worked have been efficient, but I do wish to say that I have received from each of them a much greater degree of coöperation when I caused him to feel that I was his co-worker and not his boss." This is a complex sentence but grammatically correct.

Now, moving on to the chapter "HOW THE PRINCIPAL CAN HELP THE TEACHER" and the subsequent paragraphs:

- "The principals of our city schools have for two years been carrying on a series of monthly evening meetings which have proved to be highly interesting and instructive." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "The topics chosen have been along lines that directly affected the work they are doing." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "One of the meetings was devoted to the subject 'How the Principal Can Help the Teacher.' The topic was assigned to two principals, who prepared questionnaires which were sent to all the teachers in the city." These are clear and direct statements.
- "The questions asked were along three lines: (1) What can the principal do to help the teacher in a professional way? (2) What can the principal do to help the teacher in an administrative way? (3) What can the principal do in making his personal relationship to the teacher more effective?" These are clear and direct questions.
- "Replies were received from about fifty per cent of the teachers and were classified as follows. Percentages indicate the number of teachers giving the replies which they follow:" This is a clear and direct statement.
- The subsequent sections listing the percentages and categories are clear and well-structured.
- "I shall discuss briefly some of the main suggestions made by the teachers." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "I. How the principal can help the teacher in a professional way." This is a clear and direct statement.
- "a. Assistance with the exceptional child. In these replies it will be noted that thirty-seven per cent of the teachers advocated assistance with the exceptional child." This is a clear and direct statement.
- The rest of the discussion is clear and well-structured, with appropriate use of punctuation and grammar.

Overall, the text is quite fluent. There are a few minor punctuation issues, such as the missing comma in "When I reported for work the next morning the office..." and some long sentences that could be broken up for clarity, but these do not significantly impact readability. The language is clear, the structure is logical, and the flow is smooth. There are no major grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.

For coherence, I need to evaluate how well the ideas flow together and how logically the text is organized. The text is a narrative about a principal's interactions with a janitor and then a discussion of how principals can help teachers. The transition between the narrative and the more analytical section is a bit abrupt, but it's clear that these are separate sections. Within each section, the ideas flow logically. The narrative about the janitor is well-structured, with a clear progression of events. The discussion about the principals' meetings and the teachers' responses is also well-structured, with clear headings and logical progression of ideas. The only minor issue is the transition between the narrative and the analytical section, but it's not significant enough to affect the overall coherence.

Given these observations, I would rate the fluency as a 4.5 and the coherence as a 4.5.
