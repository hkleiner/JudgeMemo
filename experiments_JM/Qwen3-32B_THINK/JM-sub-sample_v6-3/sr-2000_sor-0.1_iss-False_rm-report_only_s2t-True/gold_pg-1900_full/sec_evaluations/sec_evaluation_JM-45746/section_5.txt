Alright, let's start by analyzing the current section for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] The phrase "are such as arise out of a desire to vitalize certain studies" is awkward. "Such as" is used incorrectly here. It should be "such activities as."
- [SYNTAX] The sentence "The minor activities are such as arise out of..." is structurally confusing. It should be rephrased for clarity, perhaps as "The minor activities are those that arise..."
- [LEXICON] The term "vitalize" is a bit formal and might be less clear than "stimulate" or "energize," but it's not incorrect.
- [PUNCTUATION] The phrase "the Science Club, the Short Story Club, the French Club are illustrations" is missing a comma after "illustrations." It should be "illustrations."
- [SPELLING] "coöperative" is an older spelling (with the diaeresis) that's not commonly used today. The modern spelling is "cooperative."
- [SYNTAX] "It is difficult to find a single objectionable feature in them" is a bit wordy and could be simplified for better flow.
- [SYNTAX] "No conscientious teacher begrudges this extra time and effort and every enterprising teacher finds enough in them to compensate him liberally for his efforts." The sentence is long and could be split for better readability.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [STRUCTURE] The section starts by defining minor activities but then shifts to discussing major activities, which could be confusing without a clear transition.
- [LOGIC] The comparison between major school activities and city events (Fourth of July parade, etc.) is a bit abrupt and might not clearly connect the ideas for all readers.
- [CLARITY] The paragraph about "unpleasant things are organically connected with the pleasant" is a bit abstract and could be more clearly explained.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from discussing major activities to the janitor section is abrupt and lacks a clear connection, making the shift in topic jarring.
- [LOGIC] The mention of social dances managed outside the school is relevant but the connection to the previous discussion about major/minor activities isn't clearly established.

**Final Scores:**
- **Fluency:** The text has several grammatical and syntactical issues, but they are mostly minor and don't severely disrupt readability. The awkward phrasing in a few sentences and the older spelling might be distracting. I would rate it a 4.0, as it's mostly fluent with some minor issues.
- **Coherence:** The section has some structural and logical issues, especially with the transition to the janitor section and the comparison with city events. However, the overall argument is still understandable. I would rate it a 3.5, as there are noticeable but not severe coherence problems.
