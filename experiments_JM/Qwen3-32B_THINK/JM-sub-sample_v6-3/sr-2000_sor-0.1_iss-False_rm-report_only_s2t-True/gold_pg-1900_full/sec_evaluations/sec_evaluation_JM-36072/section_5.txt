Alright, let's start by reading through the current section to evaluate. The text is a lengthy literary analysis of Tennyson and the Victorian era, discussing his work, the Idylls of the King, and broader social and religious contexts. 

For **Fluency**, I need to look for issues like grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite dense with complex sentences and historical references. I notice some long sentences that might be a bit convoluted, but they generally follow proper grammar. There are instances where the phrasing is archaic or complex, which might be intentional for the topic but could affect fluency. For example, "We are told that he is shallow, an echo of the thoughts of educated men at the time..." – the structure is a bit wordy but grammatically correct. There's a line that says "He has followed other and still greater models, Spenser and Milton." The use of "other and still greater" might be a bit awkward but not incorrect. I don't see any spelling errors, and punctuation seems appropriate. So, the fluency is mostly good, with minor issues that don't hinder understanding.

For **Coherence**, the text should have a logical flow and clear transitions. The section starts with a comparison between Tennyson and other literary figures, then moves into his works and their reception, followed by social and religious contexts. There are some transitions between paragraphs, but some shifts feel abrupt. For example, the discussion about religion and the Oxford movement comes after a detailed analysis of Tennyson's political views, which might not be as smoothly connected. Also, the mention of various authors and their beliefs (Carlyle, Ruskin, etc.) is comprehensive but could be more structured. There's a lot of information packed in, and some parts might feel disjointed to a reader unfamiliar with the context. However, the overall argument is clear, and the ideas are presented in a way that a reader with some background knowledge could follow. The conclusion ties back to the initial points about Tennyson's relevance, which helps in maintaining coherence.

Considering the scales:
- **Fluency**: The text is mostly fluent with complex sentences that are grammatically correct. Minor issues with word choice and phrasing, but nothing that disrupts readability. Score around 4.
- **Coherence**: The flow is logical but some transitions between topics could be smoother. The density of information might make it a bit challenging, but the overall structure is coherent. Score around 3.5.

Now, identifying specific issues:
- **Fluency Issues**: [COMPLEXITY] Overly complex sentence structures. [WORD CHOICE] Use of archaic or obscure terms. [PUNCTUATION] Some sentences with semicolons or commas that could be clearer.
- **Coherence Issues**: [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between Tennyson's works and broader social contexts. [STRUCTURE] Dense information without clear subheadings or paragraph breaks. [CLARITY] Some references to historical events or figures might be unclear without context.

Final scores: Fluency 4, Coherence 3.5.
