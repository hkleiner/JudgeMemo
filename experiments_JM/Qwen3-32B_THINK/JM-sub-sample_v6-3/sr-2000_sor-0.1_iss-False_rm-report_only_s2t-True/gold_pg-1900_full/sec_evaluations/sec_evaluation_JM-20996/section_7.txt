Let me analyze the current section for fluency and coherence issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] "Being uncertain but that some of the ladrones would learn..." - This construction is archaic and awkward.
- [SYNTAX] "we at first agreed that neither of us should go to sleep" - The phrase "neither of us" is confusing when referring to multiple people.
- [LEXICON] "supinely" - This is an uncommon and somewhat awkward word choice.
- [SPELLING] "blistered" - While spelled correctly, it's repeated in the context of "well-nigh blistered faces" after previously mentioning "blisters" in the context section.
- [PHRASING] "the spell of slumber" - This is a slightly awkward phrasing.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Such a sleep!" which is more of an interjection than a complete sentence.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from the cart journey to waking up without clearly explaining how long they were asleep.
- [STRUCTURE] The transition from the cart journey to waking up is abrupt.
- [CLARITY] "the body of troops" is referenced without clear explanation of what this refers to.
- [TRANSITION] The transition to the dogs heralding their approach to the village is abrupt.
- [CONSISTENCY] The text references "we" throughout without clearly establishing who the "we" consists of, making it slightly confusing at times.

Based on these issues, I would rate:

**Fluency Score:** 4 - The text is mostly fluent with some archaic or awkward phrasing and a few grammatical issues that don't significantly disrupt readability.

**Coherence Score:** 4 - The narrative flows generally well but has some abrupt transitions and occasional confusion about who the "we" refers to and what some terms mean.

Let me review and finalize my assessment.
