Alright, let's dive into this. I need to evaluate the text for fluency and coherence using the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll skim through it to spot any issues. First, I notice some possible spelling errors. For example, "fellahìn" has an accent that might be a typo. Also, "fruited" in "But very soon the matter was fruited abroad" seems off. That should probably be "fruited" as in "became known" but maybe "fruited" is a typo for "fruitful"? Wait, no, "fruited" is a real word, but it doesn't fit the context here. Maybe it's a typo for "filtered" or "fruited" is incorrect. That's a problem. 

Looking at grammar, there's a sentence: "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." The structure is a bit awkward. "Not a little" is correct, but the phrasing feels old-fashioned, maybe not a mistake but could be smoother. 

Another part: "the great design of the principal temple to excite the admiration of the discoverers." The phrasing here is a bit choppy. Maybe "excite the admiration" is okay, but the flow is a bit abrupt. 

There's also a run-on sentence: "That the Tell el Amarna remains have escaped rapid destruction is due entirely to the sudden and violent downfall of the original splendour of the city and the complete desolation which succeeded." The structure is a bit complex, making it a bit hard to follow. 

In terms of syntax, the sentence "Here were found, sculptured and inscribed in a new and peculiar style, the rock-cut tombs..." is a passive voice construction. While not incorrect, it might be less direct. 

Now for coherence. The text is a historical account, so I need to check the logical flow. The first chapter moves from the discovery of the city to the tablets, then to the analysis of the tablets. It's generally logical, but there are some jumps. For example, after discussing the tablets' language, it shifts to the Egyptian court and administration, which is a new chapter. The transition between the two chapters is abrupt. 

In the second chapter, the transition from Amenophis III to Amenophis IV is smooth, but the mention of "preciosity" in the context of "wisdom" is a bit unclear. The reader might need more context to understand the reference. 

There's also a part where the text discusses the scribes and their use of Babylonian script, which is detailed but might be a bit dense, making it harder to follow the main narrative. 

Looking for repetitions: The term "Amenophis" is used multiple times, which is necessary for the subject but could be repetitive. However, in historical texts, this is common and acceptable. 

Overall, the text is well-structured with clear sections, but some transitions between ideas are a bit abrupt. The flow of information is mostly logical, but there are a few places where the connection between sentences is not as smooth as it could be. 

For fluency, the main issues are the spelling of "fellahìn" (maybe a typo for "fellahin"), the incorrect use of "fruited" instead of a more appropriate word, and some awkward phrasing. These are minor but noticeable. 

For coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transition between the two chapters and the dense discussion of scribes which could be confusing without more context. These are noticeable but don't severely disrupt the overall understanding. 

Scoring: Fluency would be a 4 because there are minor issues that don't significantly hinder readability. Coherence would also be a 4, as the text is mostly coherent with a few weak transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "fellahìn" (inconsistent diacritics) - [GRAMMAR] "fruited abroad" (unusual/ambiguous phrasing) - [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with passive voice (e.g., "Here were found...") - [LEXICON] "not a little delighted" (archaic phrasing)  
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between chapters (I and II) with no connecting context - [CLARITY] Dense technical details about scribes/linguistic systems lack clear explanation - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from tablet analysis to "preciosity" without explicit linkage to prior content  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
