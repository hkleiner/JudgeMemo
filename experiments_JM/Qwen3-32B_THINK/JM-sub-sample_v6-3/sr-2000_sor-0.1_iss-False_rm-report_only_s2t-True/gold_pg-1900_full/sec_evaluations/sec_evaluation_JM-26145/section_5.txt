Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a historical text with a current segment to assess for fluency and coherence. First, I need to focus on the current section, which starts with "Let them depart unsuccessful." and goes on to discuss various letters and interactions between different kings and vassals.

Starting with fluency. I'll scan for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice issues. The first sentence is "Let them depart unsuccessful." The adverb "unsuccessful" should be an adjective here, so "unsuccessfully" would be correct. That's a grammar issue. Next, "This exhortation seems to have been vain" – "vain" is a bit archaic but acceptable in historical context. The sentence structure is okay. 

Moving on, "a regular exchange of messengers" – that's fine. Then "the Sutu of the desert—doubtless at the instigation of the Babylonians—were about to kill..." The dashes here are used correctly for parenthetical information. 

In the part about Alashia: "A prince of Alashia, who never mentions either his own name or that of the Egyptian king, wrote short letters, for the most part of a business character." The phrase "for the most part of a business character" is a bit awkward. Maybe "for the most part of a business nature" would be better. That's a syntax issue. 

"Gold did not tempt him; he asked modestly for silver in return for copper, for oil, textiles and manufactured articles in return for wood for building." The structure here is repetitive but clear. The use of "for" multiple times might be a bit redundant. 

"Thus the tablets from Alashia are rich in information regarding commercial matters and questions of public rights." The sentence is clear. 

In the part about the plague letter: "Behold! my brother, I have sent thee five hundred talents of copper as a gift. Let it not grieve my brother’s heart that it is too little." The exclamation mark after "Behold!" is appropriate in the context of an ancient letter. 

The next paragraph: "Yet this ruler also had to guard himself against embassies unworthy of a king sent by Napkhuria." The sentence is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

"Another prince, in a letter unfortunately much damaged, made the complaint that Napkhuria had once caused his own name to be written first in a letter." The structure is okay. 

"As if to equalise matters, in royal letters the greetings that follow the address begin with a mention of the welfare of the writer." The transition here is smooth. 

In the part about the scratched tablet: "It is fairly certain that this letter, as well as the one complaining of Napkhuria’s breach of etiquette, came from the Hittite king." The sentence is clear. 

The section about Tushratta and Napkhuria has complex sentences but they're generally well-structured. 

Now for coherence. The text is a series of historical accounts and letters. The flow between different topics (Alashia, plague, embassies, Tushratta) is logical. However, some transitions could be smoother. For example, the shift from Alashia to the plague letter is abrupt. Also, the mention of "Nergal (the god of pestilence)" is introduced without prior context, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the references. 

The letter from Tushratta to Teye is quite detailed and flows well, but the sudden shift to the Hittite king and then to the wooden models might be a bit jarring. The mention of "wooden models" in the context of golden statuettes needs a smoother transition. 

The final part about the characters of the monarchs and the conclusion wraps up the section but the connection between the analysis and the preceding letters could be clearer. 

Overall, the fluency has a few minor issues but the text is mostly readable. Coherence is generally good but some transitions between topics and the handling of specific references could be improved.
