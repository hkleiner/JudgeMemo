Alright, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of this text. 

First, I need to check for fluency issues. That includes grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through the text line by line.

Looking at the first paragraph: "The remonstrances of Choiseul with the king against this new degradation of the throne of France, and his unconcealed scorn and disgust of the upstart countess, made a dangerous enemy for France's great minister, and was to cost him and his France very dear." Hmm, the sentence structure is a bit long. The phrase "was to cost him and his France very dear" might be confusing. "His France" could be unclear if "his" refers to the minister or the king. Also, "degradation of the throne of France" is a bit awkward. Maybe a comma or rephrasing would help. 

Next, "The king's infatuation brought royalty into utter contempt amongst the people." The word "amongst" is correct but "among" might be more common in American English. Not a big issue, but a minor stylistic choice. 

Then, "It was to cost France a terrible price--and Fragonard not least of all." The dash here is okay, but maybe a comma would be better. Also, "not least of all" is a bit awkward. Maybe "not the least" is more standard. 

In the paragraph about the castle: "Drouais, the artist, sold to her for 1200 livres (double florins), as overdoors for one of the rooms, four panels that he had bought from Fragonard." The sentence is a bit convoluted. The placement of "as overdoors for one of the rooms" might be better after "panels." Also, "double florins" in parentheses could be integrated more smoothly. 

Moving on: "They have vanished; but they served Fragonard a good turn--he received an order to decorate Du Barry's luxurious pavilion of Luciennes..." The name "Luciennes" is misspelled in the context. The previous section mentioned "Louveciennes," so this is a spelling error. That's a definite fluency issue. 

In the next paragraph: "Thus it chanced that for this wilful light-o'-love Fragonard painted the great master-work of his life..." The phrase "light-o'-love" is archaic and might be confusing. Also, "master-work" is hyphenated but "masterwork" is more common. 

The section on the canvases: "In 'The Ladder' ('L'Escalade' or 'Le Rendezvous') the Du Barry plays the part of a timid young girl..." The punctuation around the titles is inconsistent. Sometimes parentheses are used, sometimes quotes. Also, "plays the part" is a bit old-fashioned. 

Another part: "Whatsoever the cause, these canvases were rejected by her." "Whatsoever" is more formal than "whatever," which might be less common in modern writing. 

In the paragraph about Vien and Fragonard's suspicion: "Fragonard suspected, and somewhat resented the suspicion, that he was being made to paint in a sort of artistic duel with Vien." The repetition of "suspicion" is awkward. Also, the sentence structure is a bit tangled. 

Moving on: "So it came that the discarded pictures lay in Fragonard's studio for over twenty years..." "So it came that" is an archaic phrase. Maybe "Thus" would be better. 

The section about the Du Barry: "She had the crude love of fineries of the girl promoted from the gutter." The phrasing is a bit awkward. "Crude love of fineries" is unclear. Maybe "crude love for fineries" or "crude love of finery." 

In the marriage chapter: "There lived in Grasse, with its rich harvests of flowers, and given to the distilling of perfumes therefrom, a family that had come from Avignon..." The sentence is long and could be split for clarity. The phrase "given to the distilling of perfumes therefrom" is a bit wordy. 

Another part: "She was no particular beauty, as her picture by Fragonard proves; she had the rough accent of Provence; was thick-set and clumsy of figure..." The semicolon usage is correct, but the sentence is still a bit long. Also, "clumsy of figure" is an old-fashioned way of saying "clumsy in figure." 

In the paragraph about Fragonard's marriage: "The wild oats of his artistic career were near sown." "Were near sown" is a bit awkward. Maybe "were nearly sown" or "were about to be sown." 

The section on Dutch landscapists: "He stole from them the solidity of their massing in foliage..." "Stole" is a strong word here. Maybe "borrowed" or "adopted" would be more appropriate. 

Overall, there are several instances of awkward phrasing, archaic language, and some grammatical issues. The text is mostly fluent but has a few problems that slightly affect readability.

Now, for coherence. The text is a narrative about historical figures and their interactions. I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are any abrupt shifts or unclear transitions. 

The first paragraph discusses Choiseul's reaction to the king's infatuation and its consequences. Then it moves to the king's infatuation's impact on the people, followed by details about the Du Barry's purchases. The transition from Choiseul to the king's infatuation is smooth, but the shift to the castle and Fragonard's work is a bit abrupt. 

In the section about the canvases, the text explains the series Fragonard painted, which is connected to the Du Barry. The explanation of each canvas is clear, but the transition to the reason for their rejection is a bit jarring. 

The paragraph about the Du Barry's tastes and the shift in court culture is connected to the previous discussion about the canvases. However, the transition to the marriage chapter is quite abrupt. The previous section ends with the Du Barry's rejection of Fragonard's work, and the next paragraph starts with a completely new family in Grasse. This is a significant jump without a clear transition. 

In the marriage chapter, the narrative moves from the Du Barry to Fragonard's personal life. While there's a connection (Fragonard's art), the shift is not smooth. The coherence between the two sections is weak. 

Additionally, the text mentions Fragonard's influence from Dutch landscapists, but the connection to his previous work isn't clearly explained. The transition from his marriage to his artistic influences is a bit abrupt. 

There are also some unclear references, like "the strange baggage of Fragonard's flight from his beloved Paris," which is mentioned earlier but not explained in this section. This could confuse the reader. 

Overall, the text has some logical flow, but there are abrupt transitions between different topics and sections. The connections between the Du Barry's story and Fragonard's personal life and art are not always clear, leading to some coherence issues.
