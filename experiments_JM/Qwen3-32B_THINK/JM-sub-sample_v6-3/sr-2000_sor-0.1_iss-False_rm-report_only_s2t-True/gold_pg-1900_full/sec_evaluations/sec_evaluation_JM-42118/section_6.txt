Alright, I need to evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence. Let me start with fluency. The text is quite dense and uses a lot of complex sentences. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice.

First, I notice some archaic or old-fashioned language, like "'Twas" and "nay." While this might be intentional for style, it could affect fluency if it's confusing. Also, there are some run-on sentences. For example, the sentence starting with "Boucher died a few months..." goes on for a long time without proper punctuation, making it hard to follow. There's also a mix of tenses and some missing commas where they're needed. For instance, "the brush fallen out of his fingers--the light of the 'Glory of Paris' gone out." The em dash here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit abrupt. 

Next, coherence. The text covers a lot of historical events and characters. I need to check if the ideas flow logically. The transition from Fragonard's death to the political events in France is a bit jarring. It jumps from one topic to another without clear connections. The mention of various historical figures and events is dense, so it's possible that some readers might lose track. Also, the shift from discussing Boucher to the political downfall of Choiseul is abrupt. There are some unclear references, like "this strange doomed beauty who has won to the sceptre of France," which might refer to Du Barry but isn't clearly stated. The ending about Fragonard's journey to Italy is a bit disconnected from the previous political content. 

For fluency, the main issues are the complex sentences, archaic language, and punctuation problems. For coherence, the main problems are abrupt transitions and dense content without clear connections. Assigning scores: Fluency might be a 3.5 because while there are some issues, the text is generally readable. Coherence might be a 3 because the flow between topics is sometimes confusing but the overall narrative is understandable.
