Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency issues. The text is quite long, so I'll go through it paragraph by paragraph.

Looking at the first paragraph: "His master, Boucher, was grown old; he could not carry out the commissions..." The semicolon usage here might be a bit heavy, but it's grammatically correct. The sentence is a bit long, but not too bad. The phrasing seems okay. 

Next, "Bergeret de Grandcour commissioned several panels in this, Fragonard's thirty-fifth year..." The phrase "in this, Fragonard's thirty-fifth year" is a bit awkward. Maybe a better structure would be "in Fragonard's thirty-fifth year," but it's still understandable. 

Moving to the part about Choiseul and the Jesuits: The sentences are complex with a lot of clauses. For example, "He turned to the blotting out of the turbulent order of the Jesuits, whose vindictive acts against, and quarrels with, the Parliaments..." The commas here might be causing some confusion. The sentence is quite long and might be harder to follow, but it's still coherent. 

In the section about the Pompadour's death: "She died, transacting the king's business and affairs of State..." The use of a comma here is a bit abrupt. A semicolon or a period might be better, but it's not a major issue. 

The part about Fragonard and Mademoiselle Guimard: "Frago, who is said to have been more than a friend of the reckless one of the nimble feet..." The phrasing is a bit convoluted. The use of "reckless one of the nimble feet" is a bit unclear, but it's probably referring to Guimard. 

There's also some repetition in the text, like "However, the work for the lady was to have far-reaching results little dreamed of." The word "However" is used twice in quick succession, which could be a bit redundant. 

Looking at the coherence: The text transitions between different topics—Fragonard's patrons, political events in France, the Pompadour's death, and the rise of Madame du Barry. The flow is a bit jumpy, but each paragraph is connected through the theme of Fragonard's life and the historical context. The mention of Choiseul and the Jesuits is a bit of a detour from the main narrative about Fragonard, which might confuse some readers. 

There are some abrupt shifts, like from discussing the Guimard incident to the political toast and the Jesuit priest. This could make the text feel disjointed. Also, the transition to the end about Madame du Barry feels a bit out of place, as it's a different historical figure and event. 

Overall, the fluency issues are minor—some awkward phrasing, long sentences, and occasional punctuation issues. The coherence is affected by the abrupt topic shifts and the inclusion of unrelated historical events, which might make the narrative less cohesive. 

I should check if there are any spelling or grammar errors. The text seems to be in British English (e.g., "organised" vs. "organized"), but that's a style choice, not an error. Words like "transacting" and "reckless one of the nimble feet" are a bit archaic but not incorrect. 

For coherence, the main issues are the lack of smooth transitions between different historical events and the inclusion of subplots that don't directly relate to Fragonard's story. The text tries to cover multiple aspects (art, politics, personal relationships) but doesn't always link them clearly. 

So, fluency score might be around 4.5 because there are some awkward sentences but nothing that severely hinders understanding. Coherence might be a bit lower, maybe 3.5, due to the abrupt shifts and some disjointed sections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "in this, Fragonard's thirty-fifth year" creates redundancy.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and complex clauses in sentences about Choiseul/Jesuits disrupts flow.  
- [LEXICON] Unclear phrasing in "reckless one of the nimble feet" (ambiguous reference).  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome structure in "He painted for the same room a portrait of the frail beauty as an opera-shepherdess..." (awkward word order).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misplaced comma in "She died, transacting the king's business..." creates abruptness.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Fragonard’s personal story to Choiseul/Jesuit political narrative without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden detour to Madame du Barry’s rise feels disconnected from Fragonard’s main narrative thread.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of Jesuit priest’s toast and political commentary to Fragonard’s biography.  
- [TRANSITION] Jarring jump from Guimard incident to Pompadour’s death and then to Madame du Barry’s introduction.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
