Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency and coherence of the current section. The text is a detailed narrative about Fragonard's early life and career, filled with historical and artistic references. 

First, for fluency. I'll check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The text is quite long, so I need to scan through it carefully. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "So it came about--'twas in that year of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the year that saw the Pompadour come to supreme power (she had been for three years the king's acknowledged mistress)--the youth's mother..." The use of em dashes and parentheses is a bit heavy here, which might make the sentence a bit clunky. The phrase "she had been for three years the king's acknowledged mistress" is clear, but the structure could be smoother. 

Next, "gathered together the sixteen-year-old lad's sketches, and bundled off with him in a diligence to Paris." The verb "bundled off" is a bit informal, but it's appropriate in context. 

In the second paragraph: "Arrived in Paris she sought out the greatest painter of the day..." The sentence starts with a participle phrase, which is grammatically correct but could be more engaging if rephrased. 

The phrase "burst with the shy youth into the studio" is a bit awkward. "Burst with" doesn't quite fit here; maybe "burst into" would be better. 

There are some instances of passive voice, like "was destined to end his days," which is acceptable but might be more direct in active voice. 

Looking for other issues: "The lad glanced with wonder, we may be sure, at the great 'Rape of Europa'..." The insertion of "we may be sure" is a bit intrusive and could be rephrased for smoother flow. 

In the section about Chardin: "Young Fragonard made so little progress that Chardin wrote to his parents that he could get nothing out of him; and sent the lad, bag and baggage, out of his studio." The semicolon usage is correct, but the transition could be smoother. 

The phrase "fixed them in his mind's eye, and, returning to his lodging, painted them, day by day, from memory." The structure here is a bit complex but grammatically sound. 

The paragraph about Boucher's studio and the tapestry work is detailed and uses technical terms, which are appropriate but might be dense for some readers. 

In the section about Lenormant de Tournehem: "The Director-General of Buildings to the king (or, as we should nowadays call him, Minister of Fine Arts), Lenormant de Tournehem..." The parenthetical explanation is a bit long but necessary for clarity. 

The phrase "the weavers working from the enlargement." The passive voice here is acceptable. 

The sentence about Damiens: "The king took first one side, then the other." The structure is clear but could be more engaging. 

The paragraph about Fragonard's journey to Rome: "He started on his journey to Italy with Boucher's now famous farewell advice ringing in his ears..." The phrase "ringing in his ears" is a bit cliché but effective. 

Overall, the text is well-written with minimal grammatical errors. There are some instances of awkward phrasing and complex sentences that could be simplified, but they don't significantly disrupt the flow. 

Now for coherence. The narrative follows a logical progression of Fragonard's life, from his early struggles to his success. The transitions between events are smooth, and the cause-effect relationships are clear. 

The mention of historical events, like the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and the Damiens stabbing, are relevant and add context. The connections between Fragonard's experiences and his artistic development are well-explained. 

However, there are a few points where the flow could be improved. For example, the jump from Fragonard's time with Chardin to his return to Boucher is abrupt. The explanation of the tapestry-making process is detailed but could be more clearly connected to Fragonard's training. 

The paragraph about the quarrels between priests and parliaments and the Damiens incident seems a bit out of place, as it's a political event that doesn't directly relate to Fragonard's artistic journey. However, it does provide historical context, so it's justified. 

The transition to Fragonard's time in Rome is smooth, and the explanation of his struggles and eventual success there is coherent. The conclusion about his development and friendships is well-connected. 

Overall, the text maintains a clear narrative flow with logical connections between events. There are minor issues with transitions and some dense sections, but they don't hinder overall understanding.
