Okay, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The user wants me to rate it for fluency and coherence using the given criteria. 

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me go through the text sentence by sentence.

The first paragraph: "He went to a concert 'chez le lord Hamilton,' seeing and speaking with la belle Emma--Nelson's Emma." The use of "chez le lord" might be a bit awkward. Typically, "chez" is used with a person's name without the article, so maybe "chez Lord Hamilton" would be better. Also, the em dash after Emma is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit choppy. The next sentence: "He stood in Naples; he tramped up Vesuvius." The semicolon here is okay, but the transition between standing and tramping could be smoother. 

Moving on: "It was at Naples the news came..." The phrase "at Naples the news came" is a bit awkward. Maybe "It was in Naples that the news came" would be more natural. Then, "Louis the Fifteenth lay dying of the small-pox--a few days later the old king died." The em dash here is correct, but the sentence could be clearer. 

Next paragraph: "The party at once turned their faces homewards..." The phrase "turned their faces homewards" is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. The sentence is a bit long but readable. The legal part: "the loss of the lawsuit by Bergeret de Grandcour, who was condemned to give up the drawings or to pay a 30,000 livres fine (£6000)." The use of "30,000 livres" and the parenthetical note is okay, but the sentence is a bit complex. 

Now, coherence. The section starts with Fragonard's journey and the news of Louis XV's death, leading to the party returning home. Then there's a shift to the quarrel with Bergeret de Grandcour. The transition between these events is okay, but the connection between the news of the king's death and the decision to return might be a bit abrupt. 

After that, the text jumps to the chapter "THE TERROR" and the ascension of Louis XVI. The connection between the previous section and the new chapter is unclear. The shift from the Fragonard's return to Paris and the political events of the French Revolution is sudden. There's a lack of transition explaining how the events of the Revolution relate to Fragonard's personal life. 

In the part about Fragonard's life at the Louvre, there are details about his family and his sister-in-law. The mention of scandals and their correspondence is there, but the flow from his personal life to the political events is abrupt. The transition to the American Revolution and the French Revolution is not well connected to Fragonard's story. 

Overall, the text has some minor fluency issues but is generally readable. Coherence has some problems with transitions between different events and the shift to the political chapter without clear connections. Let me note the specific issues and assign the scores accordingly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He stood in Naples; he tramped up Vesuvius" (choppy transition between actions).  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing preposition in "It was at Naples the news came" (should be "in Naples that the news came").  
- [LEXICON] Unnatural phrasing in "turned their faces homewards" (archaic/forced diction).  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent hyphenation in "small-pox" (modern usage typically "smallpox").  
- [STRUCTURE] Cumbersome sentence: "the loss of the lawsuit by Bergeret de Grandcour... 30,000 livres fine (£6000)" (overly dense with legal details).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Fragonard’s personal journey to the political chapter "THE TERROR" without contextual linkage.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from the quarrel with Bergeret de Grandcour to Louis XVI’s reign lacks narrative flow.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed progression from Fragonard’s life at the Louvre to the American Revolution’s impact on France (no clear causal connection).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear relevance of detailed political events (e.g., Turgot, Neckar) to Fragonard’s personal story.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
