Let me analyze the text to evaluate its fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Issues

I'll look for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

1. [GRAMMAR] "I said, "we," as a little hint and she showed me she could take a little hint;" - This sentence has a grammatical issue with the placement of the comma and quotation marks.
2. [PUNCTUATION] There are inconsistent quotation mark usages throughout the text.
3. [SYNTAX] "I had at first found a way to persuade myself that I should soon get the better of the reserve formulated, the week after the catastrophe in her reply to an appeal as to which I was not unconscious that it might strike her as mistimed." - This is a very long and complex sentence with confusing structure.
4. [SYNTAX] "Certainly that reserve was something of a shock to me—certainly it puzzled me the more I thought of it and even though I tried to explain it (with moments of success) by an imputation of exalted sentiments, of superstitious scruples, of a refinement of loyalty." - This sentence has a confusing structure with the repetition of "certainly" and the parenthetical insertion.
5. [SYNTAX] "I may as well confess abjectly that Mrs. Corvick’s unexpected attitude was the final tap on the nail that was to fix fast my luckless idea, convert it into the obsession of which I’m for ever conscious." - This is a very long sentence with complex structure that could be clearer.
6. [SYNTAX] "She had conveyed to me in abundance that she was tongue-tied by her perversity, by her piety, that she would never break the silence it had not been given to the “right person,” as she said, to break." - This sentence has a confusing structure with multiple clauses and parentheticals.
7. [SYNTAX] "I could see meanwhile the torch she refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of memory—pour through her eyes a light that shone in her lonely house." - This sentence is metaphorical but has a confusing structure.
8. [PUNCTUATION] "I said as I smoothed down my hat: “I know what to think then.  It’s nothing!”" - The punctuation here is inconsistent.
9. [PUNCTUATION] "I recognise when I reached the street the justice of her charge." - This sentence could be clearer with a different structure.
10. [PUNCTUATION] "I had had an early copy of the book, but Deane had evidently had an earlier." - This sentence has an issue with the placement of the period at the end.

Overall, the text is well-written and generally fluent, but it contains several grammatical and syntactic issues that affect the flow.

## Coherence Issues

I'll look for logical sequencing, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and consistent structure.

1. [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different times and perspectives without always clear transitions.
2. [LOGIC] There are references to characters and events that are not clearly explained within the excerpt.
3. [LOGIC] The relationship between the narrator and Mrs. Corvick is complex and not always clearly established.
4. [LOGIC] The references to "the idol" and "the figure in the carpet" are mysterious and not fully explained in the excerpt.
5. [LOGIC] The connection between the narrator's obsession with the secret and Mrs. Corvick's refusal to share it is not always clearly presented.
6. [LOGIC] The references to "Vereker" and "Corvick" are frequent but their relationship to each other and to the narrator is not always clear.
7. [LOGIC] The transition to the next chapter is abrupt without clear indication.
8. [LOGIC] The references to books like "Overmastered" and "The Right of Way" are mentioned but their relevance to the main narrative is not always clear.
9. [LOGIC] The mention of "Drayton Deane" and his relationship to the other characters is introduced but not clearly explained.
10. [LOGIC] The overall plot is complex and requires understanding of prior events not shown in the excerpt.

The text is a literary excerpt with a complex narrative structure. While it is generally coherent within its own context, it requires knowledge of the preceding narrative to fully understand the references and character relationships.

## Final Scores

For fluency: The text is generally well-written and fluent, but contains several grammatical and syntactic issues. I would give it a score of 4.0.

For coherence: The text is coherent within its own context and maintains a logical progression of ideas, but it has complex references and character relationships that require knowledge of the preceding narrative. I would give it a score of 4.0 as well.

Let me review my assessment once more to ensure accuracy:

Fluency: The text has several grammatical and syntactic issues, but overall it reads well and is mostly fluent. The complex sentence structures reflect the literary style, but they can be challenging to follow at times. I would give it a 4.0.

Coherence: The text maintains a logical progression of ideas within its own context, but it has complex references and character relationships that require knowledge of the preceding narrative. The narrative is generally coherent but contains some confusing elements due to the complexity of the story. I would give it a 4.0.

Now I'll format my response exactly as requested.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent quotation mark usage in dialogue formatting - [SYNTAX] Overly complex and long sentences that disrupt flow (e.g., "I had at first found a way to persuade myself that I should soon get the better of the reserve...") - [SYNTAX] Confusing parallel structure in "by an imputation of exalted sentiments, of superstitious scruples, of a refinement of loyalty" - [PUNCTUATION] Misplaced punctuation in "I said as I smoothed down my hat: “I know what to think then.  It’s nothing!”" - [SYNTAX] Ambiguous structure in "I could see meanwhile the torch she refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of memory—pour through her eyes..."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Confusing references to "the idol" and "the figure in the carpet" without clear explanation - [LOGIC] Unclear relationships between characters (Vereker, Corvick, narrator) - [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in narrative perspective without clear transitions - [LOGIC] Disjointed introduction of Drayton Deane and his role without context - [LOGIC] Abrupt transition between chapters without clear narrative connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
