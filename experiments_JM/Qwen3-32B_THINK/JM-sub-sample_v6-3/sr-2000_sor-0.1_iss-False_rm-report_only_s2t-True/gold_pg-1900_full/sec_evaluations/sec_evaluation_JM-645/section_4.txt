Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. First, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "This extraordinary ‘general intention,’ as you call it—for that’s the most vivid description I can induce you to make of it—is then, generally, a sort of buried treasure?" The sentence structure is a bit complex with multiple clauses and em dashes, but it's grammatically correct. The use of em dashes and commas is appropriate. The word "induce" here is a bit unusual; maybe "elicit" would be better, but it's not incorrect. 

Next, "His face lighted. ‘Yes, call it that, though it’s perhaps not for me to do so.’" The sentence is straightforward. No issues here. 

Then, "‘Nonsense!’ I laughed. ‘You know you’re hugely proud of it.’" The dialogue is well-punctuated with quotation marks and commas. 

"‘Well, I didn’t propose to tell you so; but it _is_ the joy of my soul!’" The use of italics here is correct, indicating emphasis. 

Continuing, "‘You mean it’s a beauty so rare, so great?’ He waited a little again. ‘The loveliest thing in the world!’ We had stopped, and on these words he left me; but at the end of the corridor, while I looked after him rather yearningly, he turned and caught sight of my puzzled face. It made him earnestly, indeed I thought quite anxiously, shake his head and wave his finger ‘Give it up—give it up!’" The dialogue is properly formatted. The em dash and semicolon usage is correct. 

Next paragraph: "This wasn’t a challenge—it was fatherly advice." The em dash here is used correctly. 

"If I had had one of his books at hand I’d have repeated my recent act of faith—I’d have spent half the night with him." The em dash is correctly used to connect two independent clauses. 

"At three o’clock in the morning, not sleeping, remembering moreover how indispensable he was to Lady Jane, I stole down to the library with a candle." The structure is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

"There wasn’t, so far as I could discover, a line of his writing in the house." The placement of "so far as I could discover" is correct. 

Moving to the next chapter: "RETURNING to town I feverishly collected them all; I picked out each in its order and held it up to the light." The semicolon is correctly used. 

"This gave me a maddening month, in the course of which several things took place." The phrasing is a bit complex but acceptable. 

"One of these, the last, I may as well immediately mention, was that I acted on Vereker’s advice: I renounced my ridiculous attempt." The colon is correctly used to introduce an explanation. 

"I could really make nothing of the business; it proved a dead loss." The semicolon is appropriate here. 

"After all I had always, as he had himself noted, liked him; and what now occurred was simply that my new intelligence and vain preoccupation damaged my liking." The semicolon and structure are correct. 

"I not only failed to run a general intention to earth, I found myself missing the subordinate intentions I had formerly enjoyed." The parallel structure is a bit off. "I not only failed... I found..." The second part is a bit awkward but still understandable. 

"His books didn’t even remain the charming things they had been for me; the exasperation of my search put me out of conceit of them." The phrasing "put me out of conceit of them" is a bit old-fashioned but grammatically correct. 

"Instead of being a pleasure the more they became a resource the less; for from the moment I was unable to follow up the author’s hint I of course felt it a point of honour not to make use professionally of my knowledge of them." The structure is a bit convoluted but the grammar is correct. 

"I _had_ no knowledge—nobody had any." The italics are correctly used for emphasis. 

"It was humiliating, but I could bear it—they only annoyed me now." The sentence is clear. 

"At last they even bored me, and I accounted for my confusion—perversely, I allow—by the idea that Vereker had made a fool of me." The em dashes are correctly used. 

"The buried treasure was a bad joke, the general intention a monstrous pose." The parallel structure is correct. 

The rest of the text continues with complex sentences but maintains grammatical correctness. There are no obvious spelling errors. The word choice is appropriate, though some phrases are archaic or old-fashioned, which is acceptable given the context. The punctuation is used correctly throughout. 

Now, checking for coherence. The text is a narrative with a clear progression. The characters and their interactions are consistent. The dialogue flows naturally, and the events are logically connected. The transition from one scene to another is smooth. The reader can follow the characters' motivations and the development of the plot. There are no abrupt shifts or confusing segments. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and perspective. The connections between the characters' actions and the consequences are clear. 

There are a few instances where the narrative might be slightly complex due to the length of sentences, but the overall coherence is strong. The transitions between paragraphs and the logical flow of ideas are maintained. 

In summary, the text is fluent with minimal grammatical issues and is coherent with a clear progression of ideas. Therefore, the scores for both fluency and coherence should be high.
