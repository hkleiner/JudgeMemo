Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria. Let me start by reading through the current segment carefully.

First, for fluency, I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. The text is quite long, so I'll scan for any obvious errors. 

Looking at the first sentence: "In fact, you know,” she added with a laugh, “she really _must_!”—a proposition of which, on behalf of every one concerned, I fully acknowledged the force." The use of the underscore around "must" might be a formatting issue. The sentence structure is a bit complex but grammatically correct. The punctuation with the em dash is used correctly. 

Next, in the paragraph starting with "NOTHING more vexatious..." I notice some complex sentences. For example, "The near relative who made him an allowance had threatened to withdraw it if he should, under specious pretexts, turn for superior truth to Paris—Paris being somehow, for a Cheltenham aunt, the school of evil, the abyss." The em dash here is used to add a parenthetical explanation, which is correct. 

There's a sentence: "I’m afraid that what was uppermost in my mind during several anxious weeks was the sense that if we had only been in Paris I might have run over to see Corvick." The structure is a bit long but grammatically sound. 

I notice some words like "congestion of the lungs" which is correct. The sentence "I took him to Meran and there spent the summer with him, trying to show him by example how to get back to work and nursing a rage of another sort that I tried _not_ to show him." The underscore here might be a formatting issue. 

Moving on to the next paragraph: "The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely interlaced that, taken together—which was how I had to take them—they form as good an illustration..." The em dash is used correctly. 

In the sentence: "He had begun on the spot, for one of the quarterlies, a great last word on Vereker’s writings, and this exhaustive study, the only one that would have counted, have existed, was to turn on the new light..." The phrase "have existed" might be a typo. It should be "had existed" to maintain past tense. That's a grammar issue. 

Another part: "I did my best to sit very still, but I couldn’t help giving a jump on seeing in _The Times_, after I had been a week or two in Munich and before, as I knew, Corvick had reached London, the announcement of the sudden death of poor Mrs. Erme." The underscore in "The Times" is likely a formatting issue. 

In the sentence: "I candidly admit indeed that at the time—for I heard from her repeatedly—I read some singular things into Gwendolen’s words and some still more extraordinary ones into her silences." The em dash usage is correct. 

The phrase "All my life had taken refuge in my eyes, which the procession of events appeared to have committed itself to keep astare." The word "astare" seems like a typo. It should be "a stare" or "to keep a stare." That's a spelling issue. 

In the paragraph about Corvick's death: "He had no command of that business: this had been brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart." The word "business" here refers to driving, which is a bit of a metaphor but acceptable in context. 

The sentence: "In a dogcart he perched his companion for a rattle over Devonshire hills, on one of the likeliest of which he brought his horse, who, it was true, had bolted, down with such violence that the occupants of the cart were hurled forward and that he fell horribly on his head." The structure is complex but grammatically correct. 

The phrase "She explained that our friend, abroad, had just settled down to it when interrupted by her mother’s death, and that then, on his return, he had been kept from work by the engrossments into which that calamity was to plunge them." The word "engrossments" is a bit archaic but correct in context. 

Overall, the text is quite complex with many long sentences, but most are grammatically correct. The main fluency issues I found are the typo "astare" and the incorrect "have existed." The underscores might be formatting issues rather than actual errors. 

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative with a clear progression. It starts with the narrator's experience in Germany, then moves to the consequences of Mrs. Erme's death, Corvick's engagement, his death in a carriage accident, and the aftermath. The connections between events are logical. 

However, there are some transitions that might be abrupt. For example, the shift from the narrator's time in Meran to the events in England after Corvick's return. The narrative jumps between different time periods and locations, which might make the flow a bit disjointed. 

The use of em dashes and parentheses to add explanations is effective in maintaining coherence by providing necessary context without disrupting the flow. The cause-and-effect relationships are clear, such as how Mrs. Erme's death leads to Corvick's return and subsequent engagement. 

There's a mention of the narrator's internal thoughts and feelings, which are consistent throughout. The narrative maintains a consistent perspective and does not introduce new elements that contradict previous information. 

The only potential coherence issue is the complexity of the sentences and the dense narrative, which might make it harder for some readers to follow. However, the overall structure is logical and the events are connected in a way that makes sense within the story's context. 

In summary, the fluency has minor issues with a typo and a grammar error, while the coherence is strong with a logical progression despite the complex structure.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect tense in "have existed" (should be "had existed")
- [SPELLING] Typo "astare" (should be "a stare")
- [FORMAT] Underscores around "must" and "The Times" appear to be formatting issues rather than content errors

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Dense narrative with complex sentence structures that may challenge comprehension
- [TRANSITION] Some abrupt shifts between time periods and locations (e.g., from Meran to England events)
- [LOGIC] Jump in narrative from the narrator's internal reflections to Corvick's accident without clear transitional markers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
