Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The text is a dialogue-heavy narrative, which can sometimes be tricky. I'll go through each sentence to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing issues.

First sentence: “The information—?” That's a direct question, properly formatted with the em dash. No issues there.

Next: “Vereker’s secret, my dear man—the general intention of his books: the string the pearls were strung on, the buried treasure, the figure in the carpet.” The em dash and colon usage is correct here. The sentence is a bit long, but it's a literary style, so it's acceptable.

“He began to flush—the numbers on his bumps to come out.” The em dash is used correctly. The phrase "numbers on his bumps" is a bit unclear, but maybe it's a metaphor. Not a fluency issue, more of a clarity in coherence.

“Vereker’s books had a general intention?” Proper grammar. 

I stared in my turn. “You don’t mean to say you don’t know it?” The dialogue is correctly punctuated with quotation marks. 

“Mrs. Deane knew it; she had it, as I say, straight from Corvick, who had, after infinite search and to Vereker’s own delight, found the very mouth of the cave.” The semicolon is used correctly here to join two independent clauses. The phrasing is a bit complex but still readable.

“Where is the mouth? He told after their marriage—and told alone—the person who, when the circumstances were reproduced, must have told you.” The em dashes and structure here are correct. The sentence is a bit long, but it's part of the narrative style.

The next paragraph: “Have I been wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you, as one of the highest privileges of the relation in which you stood to her, to the knowledge of which she was after Corvick’s death the sole depositary? All I know is that that knowledge is infinitely precious, and what I want you to understand is that if you’ll in your turn admit me to it you’ll do me a kindness for which I shall be lastingly grateful.” This is a very long sentence with complex structure. It's grammatically correct but could be considered awkward in phrasing. The use of "you'll in your turn admit me to it" might be a bit forced, but it's still understandable.

He had turned at last very red; I dare say he had begun by thinking I had lost my wits. The semicolon is correctly used here. 

The rest of the dialogue and narrative seems to maintain proper grammar and punctuation. There are some complex sentences, but they don't hinder fluency. No spelling errors noticed. 

Now checking for coherence. The section is a continuation of a conversation between two characters. The flow of ideas is logical, with each character's dialogue and reactions following naturally. The narrative transitions between dialogue and internal thoughts are smooth. There are some references to previous events (like Mrs. Deane's knowledge, Corvick's search), but since the context is provided, it's clear. The progression of the conversation from accusation to realization is well-structured. There are no abrupt shifts or confusing segments. The coherence is strong, with a clear progression of the narrative and logical connections between ideas.

Possible issues: The phrase "numbers on his bumps" is a bit confusing, but it's a metaphor and doesn't disrupt the overall flow. The long sentences might be a minor fluency issue but don't make the text hard to understand. 

So, for fluency, there are a few complex sentences but they are grammatically correct. The score would be a 4.5 or 5. Since the long sentences are part of the narrative style and don't really hinder understanding, I might give a 5. For coherence, the text is very coherent with a logical flow, so a 5 as well.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with multiple clauses (e.g., "Have I been wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you, as one of the highest privileges of the relation in which you stood to her, to the knowledge of which she was after Corvick’s death the sole depositary?")
- [SYNTAX] Unusual phrasing that may confuse readers ("the numbers on his bumps to come out")
- [LEXICON] Obscure metaphor ("the string the pearls were strung on")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the mouth" without clear antecedent
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from dialogue to internal monologue without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Dense narrative progression that assumes reader familiarity with prior context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
