Alright, let's start by analyzing the text for fluency and coherence issues. First, I'll read through the current section carefully to understand the context and identify any problems.

For fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is written in a literary style, so some complexity is expected. However, I'll look for any awkward phrasing or errors that might disrupt the flow. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "I wondered if they hadn’t even quarrelled a little on the subject—a suspicion not corrected by the way he more than once exclaimed to me..." The use of "quarrelled" is correct, and the sentence structure is a bit complex but still flows. There's a dash after "subject," which is appropriate here. 

Next sentence: "She’s quite morbid about it. But she must play fair—she _shan’t_ see him!" The italics for "shan’t" are correctly used, and the sentence is clear. 

In the next paragraph: "Meanwhile he really avoided the chances London life might have given him of meeting the distinguished novelist; a danger, however, that disappeared with Vereker’s leaving England for an indefinite absence..." The semicolon is correctly used here, but the sentence is quite long. The phrase "indefinite absence" is a bit redundant, but it's clear. 

Continuing: "A year—more than a year—had elapsed since the incident at Bridges..." The em dashes are used correctly to emphasize the time frame. 

The next paragraph: "I think I was at bottom rather ashamed—I hated to remind him..." The use of the em dash here is appropriate. 

In the section with dialogue: “Not overtly,” I answered, “because her mother doesn’t like you. But I’ve always taken for granted a private understanding.” The punctuation within the dialogue is correct. 

Looking at the sentence: "He was prepared to out-Herod the metropolitan press; he took solemn precautions against priggishness, he exquisitely outraged taste." The semicolon is used correctly, but the sentence is a bit long and could be split for better readability. 

In the paragraph: "I naturally inferred that his obvious desire to make a little money was not unconnected with the prospect of a union with Gwendolen Erme." The phrase "not unconnected" is a bit complex but grammatically correct. 

The sentence: "What I took the liberty of more closely inferring was that the girl might in some way have estranged him." The structure is a bit convoluted but still understandable. 

In the dialogue: “He hasn’t gone into it, I know; it’s the thing itself, let severely alone for six months, that has simply sprung out at him like a tigress out of the jungle.” The semicolon is correctly used here. 

For coherence, I need to check the logical flow, transitions between ideas, and overall structure. The text is a narrative with a lot of character interactions and internal monologue. The flow seems to follow the characters' thoughts and events, but there might be some abrupt shifts or unclear transitions. 

The transition from the first paragraph to the next section about Corvick's work in India is smooth. The mention of Vereker's absence and the subsequent events are logically connected. However, the shift from discussing Corvick's work to his engagement with Gwendolen Erme might be a bit abrupt. 

The dialogue and internal thoughts are well-integrated, but some sentences are quite long and could benefit from clearer transitions. For example, the paragraph about Corvick's brother-in-law and the provincial paper could be split into shorter sentences for better readability. 

Overall, the text maintains a coherent narrative, but there are some complex sentences and shifts in perspective that might slightly disrupt the flow. The use of em dashes and semicolons is appropriate but could be simplified in some places for better clarity.

For fluency, the main issues are the complex sentence structures and some redundancy, but they don't significantly hinder readability. For coherence, the logical flow is mostly maintained, but some transitions could be smoother. 

Assigning scores: Fluency might be a 4.5 because the text is mostly fluent but has some complex sentences that could be improved. Coherence is a 4 as well, since the narrative is generally coherent but has a few areas where transitions could be smoother.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "A year—more than a year—had elapsed...")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of em dashes and semicolons in long sentences

- [SPELLING] No spelling errors detected  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between narrative and internal monologue  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Corvick's avoidance of Vereker to his India assignment
