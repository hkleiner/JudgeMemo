Alright, let's take a look at the current section to evaluate. I need to assess it for both fluency and coherence based on the provided criteria and scales.

### Fluency Assessment

First, I'll look for any issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation that might affect the smooth reading of the text.

**Fluency Issues:**

- [GRAMMAR] "I was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental detachment..." - This sentence is awkwardly phrased. A more natural structure would be "I was struck by the fundamental detachment I felt in the presence of these tidings."
- [SYNTAX] "The writer might go down to his grave: she was the person in the world to whom—as if she had been his favoured heir—his continued existence was least of a need." - The sentence is long and complex, with multiple clauses and em dashes that make it hard to follow.
- [LEXICON] "I had been sure that if she hadn’t got it she wouldn’t have been restrained from the endeavour to sound him personally by those superior reflexions..." - The word "superior reflexions" is archaic and obscure, potentially confusing readers.
- [GRAMMAR] "It wasn’t however, I hasten to add, that my case, in spite of this invidious comparison, wasn’t ambiguous enough." - The placement of "however" and the double negative ("wasn’t... wasn’t") is confusing and awkward.
- [PUNCTUATION] "I departed with the moral certainty that as the door closed behind me Deane would brand me for awfully superficial." - Missing comma after "me" creates a run-on sentence.
- [SYNTAX] "I find myself quite as vague as a captive in a dungeon about the tinge that further elapsed before Mrs. Corvick became the wife of Drayton Deane." - The phrase "the tinge that further elapsed" is confusing and doesn't make clear sense.
- [GRAMMAR] "I had foreseen, through my bars, this end of the business, though there was no indecent haste..." - The phrase "through my bars" is unclear in this context and potentially confusing.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. The text contains some awkward phrasing, complex sentences that are hard to follow, and a few confusing or obscure word choices, but it's generally readable and the meaning is mostly clear.

### Coherence Assessment

Now I'll assess how well the text flows as a whole, focusing on logical sequence, transitions between ideas, and overall structure.

**Coherence Issues:**

- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different narrative perspectives and timelines without clear transitions. It moves from the immediate reaction to Vereker's illness to reflections on past events and then forward to future developments.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative is dense with references to characters and relationships that were established in the previous section but are not clearly explained in this excerpt.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the immediate reaction to the broader narrative of Vereker's death and the subsequent marriages is abrupt and lacks a clear connection.
- [CLARITY] Some of the references are unclear without the full context of the previous section, making it difficult to follow the exact relationships between characters.
- [LOGIC] The text moves from the immediate concern about Vereker's health to a broader reflection on the narrator's obsession with Mrs. Corvick and then to the marriage of Mrs. Corvick and Drayton Deane, with little clear progression between these ideas.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different time points (the present moment, past events, and future developments) without clear markers, making it difficult to follow the timeline.

Based on these issues, I would rate the coherence as a 3. The text has a general narrative flow, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that make it difficult to follow the logical progression of ideas and events without prior context.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "I was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental detachment..." (awkward phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "The writer might go down to his grave: she was the person in the world to whom—as if she had been his favoured heir—his continued existence was least of a need." (complex, hard-to-follow sentence structure)
- [LEXICON] "superior reflexions" (archaic and obscure word choice)
- [GRAMMAR] "It wasn’t however, I hasten to add, that my case, in spite of this invidious comparison, wasn’t ambiguous enough." (awkward placement of "however" and confusing double negative)
- [PUNCTUATION] "I departed with the moral certainty that as the door closed behind me Deane would brand me for awfully superficial." (missing comma after "me")
- [SYNTAX] "I find myself quite as vague as a captive in a dungeon about the tinge that further elapsed before..." (confusing phrase "the tinge that further elapsed")
- [GRAMMAR] "I had foreseen, through my bars, this end of the business..." (unclear meaning of "through my bars")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Jumps between different narrative perspectives and timelines without clear transitions
- [STRUCTURE] Dense with references to characters and relationships established in previous sections but not explained here
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from reaction to Vereker's illness to broader narrative of his death and marriages
- [CLARITY] Unclear references without full context from previous section
- [LOGIC] Shifting focus between immediate concern about Vereker, narrator's obsession with Mrs. Corvick, and their marriage to Deane without clear progression
- [STRUCTURE] Jumps between different time points (present moment, past events, future developments) without clear markers

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
