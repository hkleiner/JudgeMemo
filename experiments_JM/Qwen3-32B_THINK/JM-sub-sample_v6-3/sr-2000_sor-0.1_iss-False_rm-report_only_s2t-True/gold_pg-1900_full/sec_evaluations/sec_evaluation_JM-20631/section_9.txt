Alright, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The user provided a text that includes a quote from Crabbe, a discussion about Jews fighting under their own banner, a reference to Blake's "Jerusalem," and a poem by Nina Salaman. Then it transitions into an afterword about Dr. Israel Abrahams, a eulogy for Arthur Davis, and some Talmud meetings and his works.

First, I need to assess the fluency. I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. The text is quite literary and uses archaic language, which might make it a bit dense. Let me look for any grammatical errors. For example, in the line "It is because they fight under no banner of their own," the structure seems correct. The use of em dashes and quotes is appropriate. However, there's a line that says "Self-taught I sing: by Heaven and Heaven alone The genuine seeds of poesy are sown." The colon after "sing" might be a bit abrupt, and the repetition of "Heaven" could be a typo or intentional for emphasis. If it's a typo, that's a spelling issue. Also, the transition from the main content to the afterword about Dr. Abrahams and Arthur Davis is smooth, but the shift in subject might affect coherence. 

For fluency issues, I notice some archaic phrasing like "twice-told tale" and "pervading them was the true 'joy of service.'" These might not be errors but could affect readability. The structure of some sentences is complex, which could lead to confusion. For example, "There is no friendship equal to that which is made over the common study of books." The phrasing is a bit wordy. Also, the line "Unless there be a truer still" is a bit awkward. 

Now, checking coherence. The main content discusses the role of Jews in the world, then shifts to a eulogy for Arthur Davis. The transition is marked by "CHAPTER: AFTERWORD," which is a clear signal, but the content is a significant shift. The eulogy includes details about Arthur Davis's works and personal life. The coherence of the afterword itself is goodâ€”each paragraph flows logically, discussing his scholarship, the Talmud meetings, and his legacy. However, the connection between the main content and the afterword is abrupt. The main text ends with a poem, and then the afterword starts about a different person. This might be a coherence issue in the overall structure of the document, but since I'm only evaluating the current section, I need to see if the afterword itself is coherent. The afterword does have a clear structure, discussing different aspects of Arthur Davis's life and work. However, there are some jumps in ideas, like from his scholarship to the Talmud meetings and then to the Hebrew quote from Jeremiah. These transitions are somewhat abrupt but might be intentional given the eulogic nature. 

Looking for coherence issues, the main problem is the abrupt shift from the main content to the afterword about a different subject. However, since the user specified to evaluate the current section on its own, I should focus on the afterword part. The afterword is coherent in itself, with a logical flow from his scholarly works to his personal life and legacy. However, there are a few instances where the connection between ideas is not smooth. For example, the mention of "Self-taught I sing" followed by a quote from Homer might be a bit jarring. Also, the line "Unless there be a truer still" is a bit confusing in context. 

In terms of scores, for fluency, there are a few minor issues like the repeated "Heaven" and some complex sentence structures, but overall the text is well-written. So a 4.5 might be appropriate. For coherence, the afterword is mostly coherent, but the transitions between some sections could be smoother, leading to a 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures may hinder readability (e.g., "There is no friendship equal to that which is made over the common study of books"). - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("twice-told tale," "pervading them was the true 'joy of service'") creates uneven tone. - [SPELLING] Possible typo in "by Heaven and Heaven alone" (repetition may be intentional but appears jarring). - [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "Unless there be a truer still" disrupts flow.

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from main content to afterword about Arthur Davis with minimal contextual linkage. - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from eulogic content to poetic quotes ("Self-taught I sing") creates tonal dissonance. - [CLARITY] Unclear connection between Arthur Davis's "Hebrew Accents" and the quoted Jeremiah passage in Hebrew. - [TRANSITION] Disjointed jump from Talmud meetings to Homer's "Dear to gods and men is sacred song" without clear narrative thread.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
