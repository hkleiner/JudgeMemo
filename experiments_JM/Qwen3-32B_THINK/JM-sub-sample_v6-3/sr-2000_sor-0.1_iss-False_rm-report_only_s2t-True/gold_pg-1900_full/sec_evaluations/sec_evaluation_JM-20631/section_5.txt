Alright, let's start by analyzing the current section for fluency and coherence. 

**Fluency Issues:**
I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation problems. 

1. **[GRAMMAR]**: The sentence "The Talmud observed that the Law was only given to Israel because he was so peculiarly fierce he needed curbing." uses "he" to refer to Israel, which is inconsistent with the singular "Israel." It should be "he" or "they" depending on context, but the pronoun use here is confusing.

2. **[SYNTAX]**: The phrase "it is the very argument as to the need for Christ employed by Mr. Balfour in his 'Foundations of Belief.'" has awkward phrasing. The structure "the very argument as to the need for Christ employed by..." is convoluted and could be clearer.

3. **[SPELLING]**: The word "broidering" is a misspelling of "brooding" or "embroidering." The correct term is likely "embroidering," but "broidering" is a variant, though less common.

4. **[LEXICON]**: The phrase "the wind of creation and inspiration bloweth where it listeth" uses archaic language ("bloweth," "listeth") which is stylistically consistent but may be considered non-standard for a modern reader, affecting fluency if not intended.

5. **[PUNCTUATION]**: The line "And if it is so, so it is, you know," has an unnecessary comma before "you know," which is a parenthetical phrase. It should be "And if it is so, so it is—you know."

6. **[SYNTAX]**: The sentence "It is a mysticism not without affinity to Mr. Wells's." is abrupt and lacks a verb or context, making it unclear how the mysticism relates to Mr. Wells's ideas.

7. **[GRAMMAR]**: "Do not imagine he referred to the heart as a pump..." uses "he" to refer to Jehuda Ha-Levi, which is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit complex and could be clearer.

8. **[PUNCTUATION]**: The use of em dashes and parentheses is sometimes inconsistent, like in "Harvey was still five centuries in the future—he meant the heart as the centre of feeling..." which could be better formatted for clarity.

9. **[SYNTAX]**: The sentence "This is indeed a strange statement, and only on the theory that its author was expounding the biblical standpoint, and not his own, can it be reconciled with his general doctrine of progress and evolution in Hebrew thought." is a long, complex sentence that could be broken down for better readability.

10. **[SPELLING]**: "Encyclopædia" is an archaic spelling; the modern form is "Encyclopedia." This isn't a mistake but may affect fluency if the author is using archaic terms inconsistently.

**Coherence Issues:**
Now, looking at how the text flows as a whole, checking for logical sequencing, transitions, clarity, and structure.

1. **[LOGIC]**: The text jumps from discussing Talmudic and historical Jewish perspectives to comparisons with other nations (America, England) without clear transitions. The shift from religious to historical analysis is abrupt.

2. **[TRANSITION]**: The transition from the discussion of the Jewish mission to the analysis of America's self-identification as "God's own country" is not well-structured. The connection between these ideas is not clearly explained.

3. **[CLARITY]**: The phrase "the wind of creation and inspiration bloweth where it listeth" is metaphorical but lacks context, making it unclear how this relates to the previous discussion about election.

4. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text introduces multiple historical figures and concepts (Talmud, Ibn Daud, Crescas, Abelson, Schechter, etc.) without a clear narrative thread. The structure is more like a collection of ideas rather than a unified argument.

5. **[LOGIC]**: The comparison between the Jewish concept of election and the American sense of mission is made but not thoroughly developed. The connection between these ideas is superficial and could be clearer.

6. **[CLARITY]**: The reference to "Mr. Wells's" is vague without context. It's not clear which Mr. Wells is being referenced or how his mysticism is connected to the Jewish concept.

7. **[LOGIC]**: The text discusses the evolution of national self-consciousness in America and England, but the connection to the main topic of Jewish election is not clearly established. The shift in focus is abrupt.

8. **[TRANSITION]**: The transition from discussing Jehuda Ha-Levi's views to the "Cuzari" is not smooth. The mention of the book's famous dictum is introduced without sufficient context.

9. **[STRUCTURE]**: The text moves from religious to historical to literary examples (Tennyson, Shakespeare) without a clear progression. The structure is disjointed, making it difficult to follow the central argument.

10. **[LOGIC]**: The final comparison between the Jewish mission and the American mission is not fully developed. The text introduces the idea but doesn't explore it in depth, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding.

**Final Scores:**
- **Fluency**: Despite a few issues, the text is generally readable with minor problems that don't significantly disrupt understanding. The archaic language and some complex sentences are notable, but the overall fluency is good. I'll rate it a 4.
- **Coherence**: The text has several coherence issues with abrupt transitions, unclear connections between ideas, and a lack of a unified structure. The logical flow is often disrupted, making it difficult to follow the argument. I'll rate it a 3.
