Let me analyze the given text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**
1. [SYNTAX] "The truth is, however, that it is precisely in the Old Testament that is reached the highest ethical note ever yet sounded" - This sentence has an awkward word order that makes it less fluent.
2. [SYNTAX] "not only by Judaism but by man" - The placement of "by" is awkward and could be more natural.
3. [SYNTAX] "and that this mass of literature is so saturated with the conception of a people chosen not for its own but for universal salvation" - This is a very long and complex sentence that is difficult to follow.
4. [SPELLING] "Cæsar" - This is an archaic spelling that might be distracting to modern readers.
5. [SYNTAX] "Take, for example, the forty-second chapter of Isaiah. (I quote as in gratitude bound the accurate Jewish version of the Bible we owe to America.)" - This parenthetical statement is awkwardly placed and disrupts the flow.
6. [SYNTAX] "And the isles shall wait for his teaching." - The word "isles" is archaic and might be less clear to modern readers.
7. [SYNTAX] "Let justice well up as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream." - This is a poetic phrase but has an unusual structure that could be confusing.
8. [SYNTAX] "A chosen people is really a choosing people." - This sentence has a confusing structure with the repetition of "people."

**Coherence Issues:**
1. [LOGIC] The text moves from discussing the Old Testament to Jesus to Pontius Pilate to the Old Testament again in a somewhat disjointed manner.
2. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics - Old Testament, Jesus, Pilate, Talmudical legend, Jewish vitality, and modern perspectives - without clear transitions.
3. [CLARITY] Some concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation, such as "Alenu" and "the Kingdom of God."
4. [LOGIC] The text references "the forty-second chapter of Isaiah" but doesn't explain why this particular chapter was chosen.
5. [LOGIC] The discussion of Jewish vitality and brain-power is introduced and then quickly dropped without resolution.
6. [TRANSITION] There are abrupt shifts between topics, such as from discussing the Old Testament to discussing modern perspectives on Jewish superiority.
7. [LOGIC] The text mentions "Mr. Lucien Wolf" and "Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu" but doesn't provide enough context about who they are or why their views are relevant.
8. [LOGIC] The final section about "Job, the wisdom of Proverbs, or the pessimism of Ecclesiastes" seems to be a new topic without clear connection to the previous discussion.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several issues with syntax and some archaic language that make it less fluent. However, the overall meaning is generally clear. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but has multiple issues that affect the flow and clarity.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has significant issues with logical progression and transitions between ideas. The structure is somewhat disjointed with abrupt shifts between topics. I would rate this as a 3 - it's generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections between ideas.
