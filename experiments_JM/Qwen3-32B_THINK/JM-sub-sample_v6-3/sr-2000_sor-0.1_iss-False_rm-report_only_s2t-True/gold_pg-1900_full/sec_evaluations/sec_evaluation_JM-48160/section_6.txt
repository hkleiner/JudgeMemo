Let me carefully analyze the provided text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues

I'll go through the text and identify any problems with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

1) [GRAMMAR] "All of these men were frankly loafing." - "frankly" is an adverb modifying "loafing" but the construction feels awkward.
2) [GRAMMAR] "Their only excitement they owe to the frequent visits of the taubes" - This is a sentence fragment; it should be "Their only excitement was owing to..."
3) [GRAMMAR] "I forgot to ask. Probably not." - This is a very brief, abrupt ending to a paragraph that could be smoother.
4) [GRAMMAR] "They hung from the windows, they gossiped at the pump, they mused on the bridges" - The repetition of "they" at the start of each phrase is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward.
5) [GRAMMAR] "There were often many soldiers home on leave, smoking in front of their houses or playing with their children." - The verb "were" is used twice in close proximity, creating a slightly awkward rhythm.
6) [GRAMMAR] "It is the bourgeoisie which has reduced the birth rate in France." - This should be "It is the bourgeoisie that has reduced..." for correct relative pronoun usage.
7) [GRAMMAR] "I also saw a large number of soldiers in the peaceful fields beside the noisy roads, and was told they had been sent by the authorities to help with the harvesting." - The sentence structure is correct but the placement of "and was told" creates a slight awkwardness.
8) [GRAMMAR] "And, as I have said before, they are nearly all big fellows." - The phrase "as I have said before" is grammatically correct but feels a bit out of place in the flow.
9) [GRAMMAR] "I shall always be glad that I have seen 'with my own eyes' something of the immense number (and I saw but one small section of the zone) of men that France still has at her disposal, and has not yet been able to use." - This is a long, complex sentence with some awkward phrasing.
10) [GRAMMAR] "The young men accepted the invitation, remained a month, then, very much bored, excused themselves and went home." - The transition from "remained a month" to "then, very much bored" feels slightly abrupt.
11) [GRAMMAR] "The fields devoid of soldiers were a picturesque sight with the women in blue print frocks and white sunbonnets." - The phrase "with the women" is awkwardly placed.
12) [GRAMMAR] "And there was more than one bride and bridegroom. Strange honeymoon, within sound of the guns that promised a quick disunion." - The transition between these sentences is abrupt.
13) [GRAMMAR] "The faces of the older wives looked philosophically happy, but those of the young women were drawn and pale." - The phrase "looked philosophically happy" is grammatically correct but feels awkward.
14) [GRAMMAR] "Life was beginning in tragedy; and no doubt twenty years hence they will be as torn with anxiety for their absent sons." - The semicolon usage is correct but the sentence structure is complex and could be clearer.
15) [GRAMMAR] "Major C., our Lieutenant and I were at dinner in the dining-room about eight o'clock (Madame Lyon had gone to bed), when the iron shutters were hastily lowered..." - The placement of the parenthetical phrase is somewhat awkward.

Overall, there are several grammatical issues and awkward phrasings, but they are relatively minor and do not significantly impact readability.

## Coherence Issues

I'll look at the logical flow, transitions, and overall structure of the text:

1) [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from describing soldiers in towns to discussing birth rates in France. This transition feels disjointed.
2) [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing soldiers to talking about Bulgarian crown prince and then back to soldiers in Nancy. The transitions are not always smooth.
3) [LOGIC] The text moves from describing soldiers to discussing American efforts for reconstruction, then to discussing war ruins and finally to Heine's prophecy. These transitions are abrupt.
4) [STRUCTURE] The text covers many different topics (soldiers in towns, birth rates, American reconstruction efforts, war ruins, etc.) without clear organization or thematic connection.
5) [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about the taube attack to the story of Miss Polk and Miss Ethel Crocker is abrupt.
6) [LOGIC] The text discusses both the presence of many soldiers and the absence of soldiers in different locations, but doesn't clearly connect these observations.
7) [LOGIC] The text shifts from describing the current situation to making predictions about the future (e.g., "twenty years hence they will be as torn with anxiety") without clear transition.
8) [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat meandering structure, moving from one observation to another without clear organization.

The text is generally coherent in that it maintains a descriptive narrative about the war zone, but there are noticeable abrupt transitions between topics and the overall structure is somewhat meandering.

## Final Scores

For fluency: The text has several grammatical issues and awkward phrasings, but they are relatively minor and do not significantly impact readability. I would rate this as mostly fluent with some minor issues.

Fluency Score: 4

For coherence: The text maintains a general narrative about the war zone, but has noticeable abrupt transitions between topics and a somewhat meandering structure. The text covers many different aspects of the war zone without clear organization or thematic connection.

Coherence Score: 3.5

The text is generally readable and has a clear descriptive purpose, but the transitions between topics are sometimes abrupt and the overall structure is somewhat meandering. The content is related to the overall theme of describing the war zone, but the organization could be improved.
