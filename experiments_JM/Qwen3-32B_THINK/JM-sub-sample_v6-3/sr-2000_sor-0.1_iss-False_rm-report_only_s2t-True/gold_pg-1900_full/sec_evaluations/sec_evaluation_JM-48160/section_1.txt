Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in the text. The user wants me to identify problems related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I notice some inconsistent capitalization. For example, "France to-day is sharply divided" – "to-day" is written with a hyphen, which might be outdated but not necessarily incorrect. However, there's a mix of styles in other parts, like "sauv conduit" which should probably be "sauf conduit" with an accent. That's a spelling/typo issue.

Next, there are some grammatical errors. For instance, "I have felt like an inverted snob trying to ingratiate myself with, or even to meet members, of that curious caste..." The commas around "or even to meet members" are non-restrictive, but the structure is a bit awkward. Also, "It was comparatively easy in the beginning of the war to go to the front, but the barrier grows deeper every day." The verb tense here is correct, but the phrasing is a bit stiff.

There's also some awkward phrasing like "I was able to disabuse his mind of any suspicion..." which is a bit redundant. "Disabuse" usually takes "of" followed by the thing being disabused, so "disabuse him of any suspicion" would be better. Also, "I received consolatory promises and nothing more." "Consolatory" is a bit formal and might not be the best word here, but it's not a major issue.

Punctuation-wise, some sentences are run-on or have missing commas. For example, "I have spent a good part of my life in Europe, and long since came to the conclusion that all American embassies feel they are created for is to look solemn and important and give receptions." The comma before "and long since" is necessary because it's a compound sentence.

Now moving to coherence. The text is a narrative about the author's attempts to enter the war zone. The main issue is the logical flow between paragraphs. The author starts with the division of France, then shifts to personal experiences, then to interactions with officials, and then to visiting Meaux. The transitions between these sections are abrupt. For example, after discussing the application process, the text jumps to the battlefield description without a smooth transition.

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "Alas, if it were only a month earlier—before the battle of the Somme began." The mention of the Somme battle is clear in context, but it's not explicitly explained, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the timeline.

The structure is generally coherent, but the shifts in focus from the bureaucratic process to the battlefield description could be smoother. Additionally, the author mentions "Verdun, Nancy, Rheims and Thann" as places she wants to visit, but the connection to the main narrative isn't clear. These are specific examples but might not be fully integrated into the overall flow.

In terms of coherence score, the text is mostly logical but has some abrupt transitions and unclear references. The fluency issues are mostly minor but do affect readability slightly. So I might give Fluency a 4 and Coherence a 3.5.

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from bureaucratic process to battlefield description without contextual linkage  
- [LOGIC] Unclear reference to "battle of the Somme" without prior explanation of its timing  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed focus between personal anecdotes and historical context (e.g., sudden mention of "Verdun, Nancy, Rheims and Thann")
