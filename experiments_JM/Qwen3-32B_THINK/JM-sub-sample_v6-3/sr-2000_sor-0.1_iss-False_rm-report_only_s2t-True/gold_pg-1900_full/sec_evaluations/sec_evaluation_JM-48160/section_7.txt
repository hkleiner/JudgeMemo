Okay, let's start by looking at the current section provided. The user wants me to evaluate both fluency and coherence on a scale from 1 to 5, using half-points if needed.

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. Let me go through the text paragraph by paragraph.

The first paragraph starts with "Thor will rise..." which seems to continue from the previous context. The sentence structure here is okay, but I notice some awkward phrasing like "the most interesting and beautiful ruin I saw, in spite of its sadness, was..." The "in spite of its sadness" feels a bit misplaced. Maybe it should be "the most interesting and beautiful ruin I saw, despite its sadness." Also, "was the little town of Gerbéviller" – maybe "was the little town of Gerbéviller" is correct, but the placement of "between Nancy and Remiramont" might be better after the town name.

Next, "The automobile was obliged to make its way slowly..." The use of "obliged" is a bit formal but acceptable. "Débris" is a bit old-fashioned, maybe "debris" would be more standard. "Families had set up housekeeping once more in the cellars" – "once more" is a bit redundant since they're setting up after the war. "Before the war it had a population of about 2,000 (although, as is often the case, large enough for double the number of actual inhabitants)." The parentheses here are okay but the explanation in them might be a bit confusing. Also, "All the men who were not mobilized or did not take flight at the approach of the enemy were shot..." The phrasing is clear but the sentence is a bit long. 

Moving on, "I saw a few smoking philosophically in the shade..." The verb "smoking" is missing a subject, but contextually it's "a few people smoking." Maybe a comma after "a few" would help. "The business here as elsewhere, however, is carried on mainly by the women." The "however" placement might be better after "however, the business..." 

In the part about Soeur Julie, "But her story must be told elsewhere." The transition is okay. "About eight hundred people have returned..." The sentence is clear. "There is ample room in all directions for their new homes without sacrificing one of the most picturesque and significant ruins of the war." The phrasing is a bit wordy but not incorrect.

Next paragraph: "I think it was at Sermaize that after driving through a number of streets as completely wrecked as Gerbéviller, we came suddenly upon a terrace of houses quite intact." The structure here is a bit convoluted. Maybe splitting the sentence would help. "We inquired the meaning of this odd forebearance and learned that these mansions had been the property of Germans, who had been warned before the outbreak of the war and fled." "Forebearance" is a bit confusing here; maybe "leniency" or "spared" would be better. 

Then, "Germany not only knew who owned every square inch of ground in France..." The sentence starts with "Germany," but it's a bit abrupt. Maybe "The Germans not only knew..." would be better. "One woman who lived in an unpretentious flat in Paris showed me her one rare possession, an ancient silver censer, which was on the German list when they advanced upon Paris." The phrasing is okay but "one rare possession" could be "a rare possession."

In the next paragraph, "Even before the German case became utterly hopeless..." The phrase "German case" is a bit unclear. Maybe "German position" is better. "they must have felt very sad at times while looking back over the past..." The sentence is a bit long but acceptable. 

Outside Nancy: "One fine morning in September, 1914, the German Emperor and his Staff sat their horses..." "Staff" should be lowercase. "a truly superb sight, waiting for the news that the French Army was in full retreat..." The structure is a bit awkward. Maybe "a truly superb sight as they waited for the news..." 

"We slept at Remiramont the second night, after a moist trip through the Vosges..." "Moist" seems incorrect here. It should be "muddy" or "wet." "They are formidable enough closer to the front." The phrasing is a bit abrupt. 

The part about American ambulance men: "Before the American ambulance men conquered them with their little Fords, the wounded were carried out on mule back and generally died." "Mule back" should be "muleback." 

Remiramont as a headquarters: "Major C., knowing that I wanted to go to Thann... spent the morning..." The sentence is a bit long but okay. "As it was raining the rest of us spent the time gossiping..." The transition is abrupt. 

The paragraph about Generals: "There is but one way by which a woman can get into any of these bombarded towns..." The phrasing is a bit formal. "After she is in the war zone, if she happens to know one of the Generals there, knows him quite well..." The repetition of "knows" is a bit awkward. 

"I, alas, did not know any General..." The sentence is clear. "Nor had I been in France long enough to form ties of friendship..." "Ties of friendship" is a bit old-fashioned. 

Major C.'s attempts: "But Major C. was hopeful, and very much crestfallen when word came..." The phrasing is okay. "Nothing annoys an American man, a real American of the good old stock..." The phrase "good old stock" is a bit dated. 

The part about the hotel: "Nothing would have induced me to enter that hotel again..." The sentence is clear. "The French, with all their mental suppleness and activity, are intensely conservative." The phrasing is a bit wordy. 

The newspaper gamin: "A newspaper gamin of eight, who looked five, had such an engaging little visage..." The word "visage" is a bit formal. 

Now, for fluency issues, I need to note any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice problems. The main issues are some awkward phrasing, old-fashioned terms, and a few possible grammatical errors like "mule back" instead of "muleback," "moist" instead of "muddy," and the use of "forebearance" which might be a misused word. There are also some run-on sentences that could be split for clarity. However, these are mostly minor and the text is generally readable.

For coherence, the text is a narrative describing the author's experiences in war-torn areas. The flow is mostly logical, moving from one location to another, explaining the author's attempts to visit certain towns, and the interactions with military authorities. However, there are some abrupt transitions between paragraphs, like moving from the description of Gerbéviller to Sermaize without a clear link. Also, some parts reference previous context that isn't included here, which might cause confusion for a reader not familiar with the prior sections. For example, the mention of "Soeur Julie" and her story being told elsewhere might leave a gap in understanding. Additionally, the shift from discussing the German Emperor's failed attempt to enter Nancy to the author's stay in Remiramont is a bit abrupt. However, overall, the narrative does maintain a coherent structure, with each paragraph generally building on the previous one, even if some transitions are a bit jarring.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the most interesting and beautiful ruin I saw, in spite of its sadness, was the little town of Gerbéviller" (redundant prepositional placement).  
- [LEXICON] Overly formal or archaic terms: "forebearance," "visage," "obliged."  
- [GRAMMAR] Minor errors: "mule back" (should be "muleback"), "moist trip" (likely "muddy").  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in "I think it was at Sermaize that after driving through..." (run-on construction).  
- [SPELLING] "débris" (non-standard variant; "debris" is more common).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between locations and topics (e.g., Gerbéviller to Sermaize, then to historical German Emperor anecdotes).  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jumps in narrative flow (e.g., from military logistics to hotel table etiquette).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to prior context (e.g., "Soeur Julie’s story must be told elsewhere" lacks resolution in this excerpt).  
- [STRUCTURE] Disconnected paragraphs discussing unrelated events (e.g., American ambulance efforts vs. hotel dining).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
