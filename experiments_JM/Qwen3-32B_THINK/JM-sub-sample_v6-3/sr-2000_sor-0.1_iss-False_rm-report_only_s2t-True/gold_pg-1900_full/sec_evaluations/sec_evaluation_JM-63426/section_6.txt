Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the current section of text based on Fluency and Coherence, using the provided criteria and scales. The user provided a context segment, but I should focus only on the current section. 

First, for Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me read through the current section carefully.

The text is a narrative with some complex sentences. I notice a few instances where the structure might be a bit awkward. For example, in the sentence "Displaying samples of his new line, Mr. Moses asked if I would lay out and print a showing for distribution to commercial printers and advertisers." The participle phrase at the beginning is correct, but maybe the flow could be smoother. However, it's not a major issue. 

Looking for grammar and spelling errors. The text seems mostly correct. Words like "necessarily" and "necessary" are used correctly. Punctuation is generally accurate. There's a hyphenation in "a literally made-to-order" which is correct. 

In the part about the "Victor" bicycle catalog, the sentence structure is a bit long but still clear. The use of em dashes and commas is appropriate. There's a sentence fragment in "At any rate," but it's used for a transition and is acceptable in narrative style. 

Now, checking for coherence. The text is a narrative that progresses through the narrator's experiences with the print shop. The ideas are logically connected. The transition from discussing the new line of papers to the growth of the business seems smooth. 

However, there's a shift in the last part when the narrator moves from discussing the growth of the business to the decision to close the Wayside Press. The cause-effect might be a bit abrupt. The sentence "In this growth of the commercial printing involving lay-outs and supervision..." could be clearer. Also, the part where the narrator moves to New York and the interlude in the Gay Nineties is a new section, which is separated by a chapter heading. This is a natural transition, so maybe not an issue. 

Looking for logical sequencing and clarity. The text explains the expansion of the business, the challenges faced, and the eventual closure. The connections between these events are logical. The mention of Mr. Moses' advice and the narrator's inability to follow it is clear. 

There's a part where the narrator mentions designing covers for Century, which is a bit out of the previous context but still connected to the overall theme of printing and publishing. The chapter heading "INTERLUDE IN NEW YORK" signals a new section, so it's acceptable. 

Overall, the text is coherent with a clear progression. The fluency is mostly smooth with minor issues that don't hinder understanding. For Fluency, I might give a 4.5 because there are a few minor awkward phrasings but nothing major. For Coherence, it's a 4.5 as well, with a few minor transitions but overall logical flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "a literally made-to-order, vehicle for Caslon roman and Caslon Black" (comma placement disrupts flow). - [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory clause "Displaying samples of his new line," (though stylistically acceptable in narrative prose). - [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing in "forms were lifted from the presses and transferred to the University Press" (unclear whether "lifted" means physically removed or metaphorically repurposed).  
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from business growth to personal failure ("In this growth of the commercial printing... I had waded far beyond my depth") lacks smooth transition. - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt introduction of the New York interlude after the Wayside Press closure, with minimal contextual linkage. - [CLARITY] Unclear connection between "Will Bradley credit" and earlier narrative about the Wayside Press.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
