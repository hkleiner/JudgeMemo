Alright, I need to evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the current section carefully to identify any issues.

First, fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite dense with information, but I'll check for errors. For example, in the sentence "Text on electrotypes will be reset in type from Bradley: His Book fonts," the phrase "reset in type" might be a bit awkward, but it's clear. There's a missing period after "A." in "A. Hyatt Mayor..." which is a punctuation issue. Also, "The alluring prospect of additional illustrations for these pages was reluctantly passed by." The verb "passed by" is a bit unclear; maybe "passed up" would be better. 

Next, coherence. The text transitions between different events in Bradley's career and the publication of the book. The flow is mostly logical, but there's a jump from the 1954 Portfolio to the sources and then to the Typophile project. The mention of "the undersigned reporter" is a bit abrupt without context. Also, the section about Mr. Bradley's contributions to the book's design and the note about illustrations could be more smoothly connected. The ending about him being his own severest critic is a bit sudden and doesn't tie back as clearly as it could.

For fluency, the main issues are minor punctuation errors and a few awkward phrasings. For coherence, the transitions between sections and the lack of context for some phrases are the main problems. I'll assign scores based on the criteria. Fluency has a few issues but overall is mostly fluent, so maybe a 4. Coherence has some noticeable abrupt shifts but is generally coherent, so a 3.5.
