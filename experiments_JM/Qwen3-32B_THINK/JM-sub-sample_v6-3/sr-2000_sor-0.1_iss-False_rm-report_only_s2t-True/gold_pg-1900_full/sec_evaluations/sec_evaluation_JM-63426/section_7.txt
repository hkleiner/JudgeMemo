Okay, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The text is a narrative section with a mix of storytelling and historical information about magazines and the author's career. 

First, for Fluency: I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text has some long sentences and complex structures. Let me scan through.

There's a line: "Sometime when you are rich and feel like sending me something,--why, any amount you happen to send will be quite all right with me--and good luck go with you." The em dash usage here is a bit non-standard. Maybe a comma instead? Also, "good luck go" should be "good luck go" is correct, but the structure is a bit awkward. Wait, actually, "good luck go with you" is correct, but the sentence is a bit wordy. 

Another part: "the return mail brings a pleasant letter of thanks and an acknowledgment of payment in full." That's okay. 

Looking for other issues: "And now, as you are recrossing Madison Square Park, your head so high in the clouds..." The phrase "so high in the clouds" is a metaphor, but the structure is a bit abrupt. Maybe a comma after "as you are recrossing..."? Also, "your head so high" could use a verb like "is so high." 

In the next paragraph: "Well, that is that, and of course you are now sitting pretty." The phrase "sitting pretty" is idiomatic but might be a bit jarring if not properly explained. 

"Meanwhile Bradley: His Book met with kind reception..." The colon usage here is correct, but the transition from the previous narrative to a new section is abrupt. Also, "advance orders for the second number being: Brentano’s New York, six hundred copies..." The colon after "being" is okay, but the structure is a bit fragmented. 

Looking at the rest: The text has a lot of run-on sentences and some awkward phrasing, but overall, it's readable. There are a few grammatical issues but not too many to make it hard to follow. So maybe a 4 for fluency, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now for Coherence: The text transitions between different sections and topics. The first part is a narrative about a character, then shifts to a list of orders and business details, then to another narrative about Mr. Bok and the author's career. The transition from the initial story to the business details is a bit abrupt. 

The section starts with a character interaction, then jumps to "Meanwhile Bradley: His Book..." which is a different topic. The connection between the two isn't clear. Then there's a shift to a new chapter, "NEW FIELDS," which continues the narrative but the transition is abrupt. 

In the "MAGAZINE WORLD" chapters, the text provides historical context, but the connection to the previous sections isn't smooth. The reader might get confused about the timeline and the relationships between the different parts. 

There are some unclear transitions and shifts in perspective, but the overall narrative does have a logical progression within each chapter. The main issue is the abrupt transitions between different sections. So maybe a 3.5 for coherence, as there are noticeable shifts and some unclear connections, but the text is generally coherent within each section.
