Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues. The text is quite long and detailed, so I need to check for any grammar, spelling, or syntax problems.

First, I notice some missing commas where they're needed for clarity. For example, "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The dash here might be better as a comma or a colon. Also, in "Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window," the structure feels a bit awkward. Maybe a comma after "Having half an hour of leisure" would help.

There are instances where the word order is a bit off. Like "The two jobbers are kicked." Without context, "kicked" seems odd here. It might be a typo or a missing word. Also, "he is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings. Attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare." The transition between these clauses is a bit abrupt. Maybe a semicolon or a comma could make it smoother.

Looking at spelling, I don't see any obvious misspellings. The terms like "Ingersoll dollar watch" and "George A. Newett" seem correctly spelled. However, "You are now a working man--wages three dollars a week." The double dash might be better as a colon. Also, "It is the typical atelier of the Victorian Eighties: oriental drapes, screens and pottery." The colon here is correct, but the list after might benefit from a comma between "screens" and "pottery."

In terms of syntax, some sentences are a bit run-on. For example, "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and “borrow” packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler." This could be split into two sentences for better readability. Also, "When there are no theater or patent medicine ads to put up you cover the boards with blank newsprint and letter and picture advertisements for the stores." Adding a comma after "ads to put up" would help.

Now, moving to Coherence. The text is a narrative, so I need to check the logical flow and transitions between ideas. The story moves through different phases of the protagonist's life, from working in the print shop to moving to Chicago. Each section is generally clear, but there are a few places where the transitions could be smoother.

For example, after the part about Mr. Newett shooting the kerosene tank, the text jumps to the protagonist and a compositor having control of the town bill posting. The connection between these two events isn't immediately clear. It might help to have a sentence explaining how they came to have control of the bill posting after that incident.

Another point is when the protagonist decides to go to Chicago again. The transition from the first sojourn to the second isn't very smooth. The text mentions saving money and returning, but the connection between the two visits could be clearer. Also, the mention of "three twenty-dollar gold pieces" in the second chapter might be redundant since the first sojourn already mentioned saving gold pieces.

There's also a part where the protagonist is learning to engrave tints on wood-blocks under the "erroneous impression." The jump from that to realizing that designers don't engrave their own blocks is a bit abrupt. A sentence explaining the realization would help the flow.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are a few instances where the transitions between events or ideas could be smoother. The narrative does follow a logical progression, but some parts could use better signposting to guide the reader through the timeline and events.
