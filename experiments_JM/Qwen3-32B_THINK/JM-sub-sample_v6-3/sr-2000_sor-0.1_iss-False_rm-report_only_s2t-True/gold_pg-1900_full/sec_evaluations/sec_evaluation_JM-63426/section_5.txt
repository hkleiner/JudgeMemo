Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

FLUENCY ISSUES:
1) [GRAMMAR] - There are some grammatical issues, such as "Typography, with nothing to its credit following Colonial times, had reached a low ebb during the Victorian period" which is awkwardly phrased.
2) [SPELLING] - There appears to be a spelling issue with "æsthetic" which is an archaic spelling of "esthetic" or "aesthetic."
3) [PUNCTUATION] - The sentence "At this time the Caslon mats, imported from England, are in possession of one or two branches of the American Type Founders, probably those in New York and Boston, possibly the Dickenson Foundry in Boston." has excessive commas that make it difficult to follow.
4) [SYNTAX] - Some sentences are very long and complex, making them harder to follow, such as "This Colonial typography, void of beauty-destroying mechanical precision, is the most direct, honest, vigorous and imaginative America has ever known--a sane and inspiring model that was to me a liberal education and undoubtedly the finest influence that could come to me at this time--1895."
5) [WORD CHOICE] - Some word choices seem archaic or overly formal for the context, such as "graciously permitted access" and "gloated over dozens of them."
6) [PUNCTUATION] - The phrase "When the tide is at the lowest, ’tis but nearest to the turn." has unusual punctuation with the opening single quote.

COHERENCE ISSUES:
1) [LOGIC] - The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions, such as from discussing the Wayside Press to discussing the Arts and Crafts Society and then to various printing presses in different cities.
2) [STRUCTURE] - The narrative structure is somewhat disjointed, with the author moving back and forth in time and between different aspects of their life and work.
3) [CLARITY] - Some passages are not clearly connected to the central narrative about the Wayside Press, such as the detailed descriptions of the author's apron and the description of Mr. Moses' appearance.
4) [TRANSITION] - There are abrupt transitions between paragraphs, such as from discussing the Barton collection to the author's membership in the Arts and Crafts Society.
5) [LOGIC] - The flow of information is sometimes confusing, with cause and effect not always clearly established.
6) [STRUCTURE] - The text lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end structure, instead meandering through different topics and events.

Now, I'll assign scores:

For Fluency:
The text has some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but it is generally readable. The issues are mostly minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall readability. I would give it a score of 4.

For Coherence:
The text has some coherence issues with abrupt transitions and a somewhat disjointed narrative structure. However, the overall story is generally understandable and flows in a logical sequence most of the time. I would give it a score of 3.5.

Let me double-check my analysis and scores:

The text is written in a somewhat formal and archaic style, which may contribute to some of the fluency issues. However, it is generally well-written and readable. The coherence is somewhat affected by the meandering narrative and abrupt transitions between topics, but the central theme of the Wayside Press and the author's experiences is clear throughout.

I'll maintain my scores of 4 for Fluency and 3.5 for Coherence.
