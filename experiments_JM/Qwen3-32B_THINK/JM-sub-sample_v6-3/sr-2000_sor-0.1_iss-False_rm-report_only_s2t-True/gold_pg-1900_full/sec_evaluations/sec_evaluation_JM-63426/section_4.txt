Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The text is quite long and detailed, so I need to look for any grammar, spelling, or phrasing issues.

First, I'll read through the text carefully. The first part is "You tell him of your small outfit and that he can have it and the benefit of payments made if he will assume future installments. He agrees." This seems grammatically correct. No obvious spelling errors here. The phrasing is clear and concise.

Next, the chapter titled "THE GAY NINETIES" starts with a description of Chicago. The sentences are complex but well-structured. For example, "Chicago a phoenix city risen from the ashes of its great fire; downtown business buildings two, three and four stories high..." The use of semicolons here is correct as they're connecting related independent clauses. The syntax is a bit dense but not incorrect. There's a possible issue with the phrase "a continuous singing of steel car-cables on State Street and Wabash Avenue; horse-drawn cross-town cars thickly carpeted with straw in winter;" – the semicolon usage here is appropriate, but the sentence is very long and might be hard to follow, though it's not a grammatical error.

Looking for any spelling errors. Words like "bonneted", "wasp waists", "leg o’ mutton", "bustles" are spelled correctly. There's a mention of "high-buttoned waist-coats" – the hyphenation is correct. "Piccadilly collars and double-ended cuffs" – all correct. The phrase "object matrimony" in the anecdote about the author's hero seems out of place. It should probably be "object: matrimony" with a colon or maybe "object is matrimony". That might be a punctuation issue or a missing word. 

In the part about the author's hero in the train, the sentence structure is a bit jumbled. The phrase "object matrimony" is unclear without a colon or a verb. That's a minor fluency issue due to missing punctuation.

Looking at the sentence: "Romance, incident ruthlessly deleted by publisher, proves a best seller)." The sentence ends with a closing parenthesis but there's no opening one. That's a punctuation error. Also, the phrase "incident ruthlessly deleted by publisher" is missing a verb. It should probably be "incident, which was ruthlessly deleted by the publisher..." or similar. This is a grammatical issue.

Another example: "We now move to Geneva, Illinois, and I have my studio in a cottage overlooking the beautiful Fox River." This sentence is fine, but the transition from the previous paragraph to this one is abrupt. However, since the instruction says to evaluate the section on its own terms and not worry about context, this might be acceptable.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent. There are a few punctuation issues and one instance where a word seems to be missing ("object matrimony"). The rest of the text is well-written with correct grammar and spelling. So the fluency score would likely be a 4 or 5. Given the few minor issues, I'll say 4.5.

Now for coherence. The text is a descriptive passage about the 1890s in Chicago, covering various aspects like fashion, technology, cultural events, and personal anecdotes. The flow is logical and the ideas are connected. The chapter starts with a description of the city, moves to fashion, then to cultural aspects, and ends with the author's experiences.

There's a transition from the initial anecdote about Fred Goudy to a broader description of the 1890s, which is a bit abrupt. However, since this is a section in a larger work, the transition might be justified by the overall structure. The mention of various events and people is well-organized, and the narrative moves smoothly from one topic to another.

One potential issue is the anecdote about the author's hero and the reversed cuffs. This is a bit of a digression but is integrated into the description of fashion. It's not confusing, but it might be a minor coherence issue because it's a story within a story. However, since it's presented as an example of the era's fashion, it's relevant.

Another possible issue is the transition from the anecdote about the hero to the description of furniture and studios. The sentence "Black walnut furniture upholstered in hair-cloth..." follows the anecdote about the hero, which is a shift in topic but still within the context of describing the 1890s. This is a minor abrupt shift but not a major coherence problem.

The overall structure is clear and the ideas are logically presented. There are no major inconsistencies or confusing segments. The coherence is strong, so a score of 4 or 5. Given the minor transitions and one digression, I'll give it a 4.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing opening parenthesis in "Romance, incident ruthlessly deleted by publisher, proves a best seller)."
- [GRAMMAR] Missing verb in "object matrimony" (should be "object: matrimony" or "object is matrimony")
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentence structure in the anecdote about the author's hero and reversed cuffs

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from business arrangement with Fred Goudy to detailed description of 1890s Chicago without transitional sentence
- [LOGIC] Brief anecdote about the author's hero feels slightly disconnected from surrounding content about 1890s fashion
- [CLARITY] The parenthesis about the publisher deleting the romance story creates a minor confusion in narrative flow

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
