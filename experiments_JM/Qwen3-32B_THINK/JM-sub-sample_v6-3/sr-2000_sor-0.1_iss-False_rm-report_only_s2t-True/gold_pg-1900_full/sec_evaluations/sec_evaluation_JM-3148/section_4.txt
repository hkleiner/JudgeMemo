Alright, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to evaluate the current section of the text for fluency and coherence, using the provided criteria and scoring scales. I need to make sure I follow the instructions carefully.

First, I'll look at the Fluency metric. The definition mentions checking for syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me scan the text for any issues here.

Looking at the current section, the sentences are quite long, which might be a problem for fluency. For example, the sentence starting with "The blind Anthony Croft..." is a run-on. It uses a semicolon but still feels too long. Also, there's a part where it says "head among the clouds, feet stumbling, eyes and ears open..." – the structure here is a bit jarring. There's a comma splice in "He was not able to realise his ideals, but he had the angel aim..." which is a grammar issue. The word "realise" is British spelling; if the text is meant to be American, that's a problem. Also, "consecrated fashion" might be a bit awkward phrasing.

Now moving to Coherence. The text should have a logical progression and smooth transitions. The current section starts with Anthony's education and then shifts to Mrs. Butterfield's death. The transition from Anthony to Mrs. Butterfield is abrupt. There's a sudden jump from discussing Anthony's ideals to a completely different character and event. The introduction of Aunt Mehitable and her actions feels disconnected from the previous part about Anthony. The mention of "CHAPTER: III" and the quote from Emerson's _Harp_ might indicate a new section, but the connection isn't clear. Also, the detailed description of Aunt Hitty's planning of the funeral is detailed but doesn't relate back to Anthony, creating a disjointed narrative.

For Fluency, the issues are mainly run-on sentences, comma splices, and awkward phrasing. For Coherence, the main problem is the abrupt shift in focus from Anthony to Mrs. Butterfield without a clear transition. There's also a lack of connection between the two parts of the text. 

Now, applying the scoring scales. For Fluency, there are several issues but the text is still mostly readable. Maybe a 3.5? The run-ons and comma splices are noticeable but not too distracting. The British spelling is minor. 

For Coherence, the abrupt transition and disconnected sections are significant. The text starts with Anthony and then moves to a completely different story about Mrs. Butterfield. This would be a 2.5, as the overall structure is confusing and the connection isn't clear. The reader has to work to follow the shift in focus.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences with excessive clauses (e.g., "The blind Anthony Croft... God’s secret thought").  
- [GRAMMAR] Comma splice in "He was not able to realise his ideals, but he had the angel aim..."  
- [LEXICON] British spelling ("realise") in a context that may expect American English.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "consecrated fashion" and "imperious genius surmounts all obstacles."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Anthony Croft’s narrative to Mrs. Butterfield’s death without contextual linkage.  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected shift from Anthony’s ideals to Aunt Hitty’s funeral planning, creating narrative dissonance.  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear connection between the philosophical reflection on Anthony and the sudden introduction of Mrs. Butterfield’s story.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
