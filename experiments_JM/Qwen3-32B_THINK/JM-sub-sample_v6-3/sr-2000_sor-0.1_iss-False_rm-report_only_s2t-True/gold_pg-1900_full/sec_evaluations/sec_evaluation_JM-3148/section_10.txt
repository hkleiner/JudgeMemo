Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the current section. The text is written in a literary style, which is common in older works. I need to check for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, or awkward phrasing.

First, I notice that there are some contractions and informal phrases like "out o’ the common" which might be a typo or an intentional style. The rest of the text seems to be in standard English. There are complex sentences, but they are well-structured. I don't see any obvious grammar mistakes. Words like "all-engrossing" and "divinely tender" are a bit archaic but still correct. The punctuation seems appropriate. There's a line that says "if she, in her womanly mercy, would love him and help him bear his burdens." The comma usage here is a bit heavy, but it's not incorrect. Overall, the fluency is high with minor issues that don't disrupt the flow.

Now for coherence. The section continues the narrative from the previous part, which is important. The ideas flow logically, showing the development of the relationship between Anthony and Lyddy. There are clear transitions between paragraphs, and the progression from their emotional connection to their interactions and the setting in the orchard is smooth. The use of descriptive language and the dialogue helps maintain coherence. However, there's a slight jump when introducing Davy and his role, but it's explained in the context. The ending ties back to the beginning, reinforcing the theme. No major coherence issues are present. The structure is consistent and the narrative is well-organized.
