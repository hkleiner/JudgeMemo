Alright, I need to evaluate the current section of the text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the section carefully. The current segment is about Veronese's journey to Rome, his stay there, and his return to Venice. 

First, for fluency. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The sentences seem generally well-structured. For example, "The appointment of his friend and patron as ambassador to the Holy See, afforded him an opportunity..." has a comma splice. That's a syntax issue. Also, "we are reduced to mere conjecture" is a bit awkward but not a major problem. There's a sentence like "It must therefore be concluded that he contented himself..." which is a bit wordy but still clear. I don't see any spelling mistakes. The use of "extant" and "sustain" is correct. There are a few instances where the sentence structure could be smoother, but overall, the fluency is pretty good.

Next, coherence. The section starts with Veronese's journey to Rome, mentions the lack of documents, and then discusses his possible artistic activities there. The transition to his temperament and the conclusion about his art is a bit abrupt. The paragraph about his return to Venice and the subsequent chapters flow well, but the connection between the journey to Rome and the return is clear. The anecdotes about his paintings and the Duccal Palace decoration are well-placed. However, the shift from discussing his return to Venice to the decoration of the palace might be a bit sudden. There's a logical progression, but some transitions could be smoother. The structure is mostly coherent, but there are a few points where the flow could be improved.

For fluency score: There are minor issues like the comma splice and some wordiness, but nothing that hinders understanding. I'd say a 4.5. For coherence: The overall structure is good, but some transitions are abrupt. Maybe a 4.0.
