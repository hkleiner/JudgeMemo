Okay, I need to evaluate the current section for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully. 

First, fluency. The text is quite long and dense with information about Veronese's works and their locations. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The sentences are generally well-structured, but there might be some run-on sentences or places where punctuation is missing. For example, in the first paragraph, there's a long list of paintings without clear separation, which could make it a bit hard to follow. Also, phrases like "it is believed that the canvas now in the Museum at Berlin" might be better with a comma after "Berlin" to separate the clauses. I notice some commas are missing in lists, like "a Christ in Glory, Venice and the Doge Venier, a Faith, a St. Mark..." which could be confusing. There's also the use of "the present time" which is a bit wordy; "currently" would be more concise. However, these are minor and don't really disrupt the overall readability.

Next, coherence. The text is a detailed account of Veronese's works in various locations. I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are any abrupt transitions. The current section starts with the Palace of the Doges, moves to the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, then to Veronese's international commissions, and ends with his later years and death. The structure seems logical, but there's a sudden shift from discussing his works in Venice to his commissions in other countries. The transition from the Fondaco dei Tedeschi to the Duke of Savoy's commissions is a bit abrupt. Also, the last part about his death and legacy feels a bit disconnected from the previous sections, but it's a natural conclusion to the biography. There's a lot of information, but it's all related to Veronese's career and works, so the coherence is maintained. However, some sentences could be better connected with transitions like "In addition" or "Furthermore" to smooth the flow.

For fluency, I'll note the minor punctuation and word choice issues but since they don't significantly hinder understanding, the score should be around 4.5. Coherence is mostly good, with a few transitions that could be smoother, so maybe a 4.0. Let me double-check for any major issues I might have missed. The text is dense but well-organized, so the scores seem appropriate.
