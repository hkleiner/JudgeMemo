Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice.

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence "It has been said of Veronese that he was the most absurd and the most adorable of the great painters." is a bit long but seems okay. The next sentence "Paradoxical as it sounds, this judgment is perfectly true." is concise. However, in "Absurd, Veronese undoubtedly was, in his disdain of logic and common sense," the structure is a bit awkward. Using "Absurd, Veronese undoubtedly was" is a misplaced modifier. It should be "Veronese was undoubtedly absurd." That's a grammar issue.

Next, "in his anachronistic habit of garbing antiquity in modern raiment." The phrase "garbing antiquity in modern raiment" is a bit unclear. Maybe "clothing antiquity in modern attire" would be clearer. But it's more a matter of clarity than fluency. However, the sentence as a whole is a bit convoluted, which affects fluency.

In "Thanks to the rare power of his genius, the most audacious improbabilities vanish beneath the magic adornments with which he covers them," the phrase "covers them" is a bit awkward. "Covers them" could be replaced with "adorns them" for better fluency.

Moving on to the second paragraph, "Veronese was neither a thinker nor an historian, nor a moralist; he was quite simply a painter, but he was a very great one." The repetition of "a" and the structure here is a bit clunky. It could be smoother as "Veronese was neither a thinker, historian, nor moralist; he was simply a painter, and a very great one at that."

In "If his preference is for the joyous scenes of life, that is because life treated him indulgently from his earliest years;" the tense shifts from present to past. "If his preference is" should be "If his preference was" to maintain consistency with the rest of the paragraph.

The sentence "What these paintings of Veronese reproduce for us are the thick, rich carpets of Smyrna, newly unladen from Musselman feluccas, monkeys imported from tropic islands, greyhounds brought from Asia, and negro pages purchased on the Riva dei Schiavoni, the Quay of the Slaves, to bear the trains of the patrician beauties of Venice." This is a very long sentence with multiple items listed. While it's descriptive, the length and complexity could be considered awkward, affecting fluency.

In the next chapter, "Nevertheless, Veronese was not a native of Venice but of Verona, as is indicated by the surname that was bestowed upon him during his life and that has adhered to him ever since." The phrase "as is indicated by the surname that was bestowed upon him during his life and that has adhered to him ever since" is a bit wordy. It could be simplified to "as his surname, bestowed during his lifetime, indicates."

The sentence "The correct date is now verified by the discovery, in San Samuele of Venice, Veronese's parish church, of the register of deaths wherein the decease of the great painter is entered as having occurred the 19th of April, 1588, the very day when he completed his sixtieth year." This is a very long and complex sentence with multiple clauses. The use of "wherein" and "the very day when he completed his sixtieth year" is a bit archaic and could be simplified for better fluency.

In "Veronese's father, being of a logical turn of mind, wished, since he himself was a sculptor, to make a sculptor of his son." The structure is a bit convoluted. It could be rephrased as "Veronese's father, who was a sculptor and had a logical mind, wanted to make his son a sculptor."

The sentence "He applied himself to learn to paint with so much zeal and imagination that his father made no attempt to check his inclination, but entrusted him to Badile." The phrase "made no attempt to check his inclination" is a bit awkward. It could be "did not try to stop his inclination."

In "The future genial painter of wondrous fantasy yielded himself without a murmur to the rude but salutary exigencies of technique." The phrase "yielded himself without a murmur" is a bit old-fashioned and might be less fluent in modern English.

The sentence "Such lessons always bear their fruit." This is a bit vague and could be more direct, like "Such lessons always prove fruitful."

In "At an age when young folk have not usually begun to form dreams of the future, young Caliari had already forced himself upon the attention of Verona," the phrase "forced himself upon the attention" is a bit awkward. It could be "forced his way into the attention."

The sentence "The cardinal, delighted with this picture, gave preference to Veronese over his three competitors." The phrase "gave preference to Veronese" is a bit awkward. It could be "preferred Veronese over his three competitors."

In "Veronese lost no time in returning to Verona, but, however flattering the esteem with which his compatriots surrounded him might be, he was not long in finding that the limited scope afforded by his native city was too narrow for his activity." This is a very long and complex sentence. It could be broken down for better fluency.

In "He had a boyhood friend, Battista Zelotti, a painter like himself, and also like himself tormented by dreams of glory." The repetition of "like himself" is redundant. It could be "and also tormented by dreams of glory."

Now, moving to coherence. The text is about Veronese, his background, and his early career. The structure is mostly logical, moving from his introduction as an artist to his early years, family, education, and early works. However, there are a few places where the transitions between ideas are abrupt or where the flow could be improved.

In the introduction, the text starts with a quote about Veronese, then discusses his characteristics, and then moves to his works. This is a logical flow. However, the transition from discussing his works to his personal life in the next chapter is a bit abrupt. The first chapter is about his general qualities and works, while the second chapter is about his early life and career. This is a natural progression, but the transition could be smoother.

In the second chapter, the text moves from his birthplace to his family, then to his education, and then to his early works and commissions. This is a logical progression. However, the transition from his education to his early works is a bit abrupt. The text could benefit from a sentence that connects his education to his early career.

In the section about his commission for the cardinal, the text describes the competition and his success. This is well-structured. However, the transition from the competition to his return to Verona is a bit abrupt. The text could use a sentence that connects his success to his decision to return.

The text also has a lot of detailed information about his early life and works. While this is informative, the sheer volume of detail could make the text feel a bit dense and less coherent. However, this is more about style than coherence.

Overall, the text is well-structured and flows logically from one topic to the next. The main issues are some awkward phrasing and complex sentences that affect fluency, but the coherence is generally good. The structure allows the reader to follow Veronese's life and career in a logical manner.
