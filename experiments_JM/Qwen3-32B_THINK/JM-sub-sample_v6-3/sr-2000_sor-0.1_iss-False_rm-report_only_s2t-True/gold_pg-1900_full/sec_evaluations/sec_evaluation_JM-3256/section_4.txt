Alright, let's dive into evaluating the given text. The user wants me to assess both fluency and coherence, using the provided criteria. I need to be thorough but concise, pointing out the most significant issues for each metric.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long and filled with complex sentences. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing. Let me scan through for any obvious errors. The first part seems okay, but there are some awkward phrasings. For example, "The very strength of old Edinburgh and of the Scots-folk is in the Heart of Midlothian." The use of "the" before the book title might be inconsistent. Wait, actually, the title is italicized, so maybe that's correct. 

Looking further, "The bookman has indeed no trouble arranging his gossips in his mind..." The word "gossips" here is a bit odd. It might be a term of endearment, but it's a bit archaic and could be confusing. Maybe a syntax issue. 

There's a part where the text shifts from discussing Jeanie Deans to the bookman's library. The transition is abrupt, but that's more coherence than fluency. Back to fluency: some sentences are very long, which can affect readability. For example, "It is days before five shelves are reconstructed, days of unmixed delight, a perpetual whirl of gaiety, as if one had been at a conversazione, where all kinds of famous people whom you had known afar had been gathered together and you had spoken to each as if he had been the friend of your boyhood." The structure here is complex but grammatically correct. However, the use of "conversazione" is a bit archaic and might be a lexicon issue. 

Another point: "He will be all his life rearranging, and so comes to understand how it is that women spend forenoons of delight in box rooms or store closets, and are happiest when everything is turned upside down." The phrasing here is a bit convoluted. The use of "forenoons" is correct but might be a stylistic choice. 

Looking for spelling errors: "conversazione" is spelled correctly. "Non omnis moriar" is a Latin phrase, so that's correct. 

Syntax-wise, some sentences have multiple clauses that could be split for clarity, but they aren't necessarily incorrect. For example, "After a brief glance at a folio and an octavo side by side he gives up that attempt, but although he may have to be content to see his large Augustine, Benedictine edition, in the same row with Bayle’s Dictionary, he does not like it and comforts himself by thrusting in between, as a kind of mediator, Spotswood’s History of the Church of Scotland with Burnett’s Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton, that edition which has the rare portrait of Charles I. by Faithorne." This sentence is quite long and might be a bit overwhelming, but it's still grammatically sound. 

So, for fluency, the main issues are some awkward phrasing and the use of archaic or complex vocabulary that might be less common. There's also a potential issue with the transition between topics, but that's more coherence. I don't see any major grammar or spelling mistakes. The fluency score would likely be a 4 or 4.5 since the text is mostly fluent but has some minor issues that might distract a reader.

Now for coherence. The text starts discussing literary passages and then shifts to the bookman's library and his habits. The transition from discussing Jeanie Deans to the bookman's rearranging of books is a bit abrupt. The coherence here depends on how well the ideas connect. The first part is about literature and strong characters, while the latter part is about a bookman's personal experiences and preferences. The connection isn't immediately clear, so this could be a coherence issue. 

Another point is the shift from discussing the bookman's library to historical figures and their love for books. The flow from the bookman's habits to inviting historical book collectors is a bit jarring. The text jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions. 

There's also a part where the author compares the bookman's rearranging to women's organizing in box rooms. The analogy is made, but the connection isn't explained, which might confuse the reader. 

The text also mentions Mary Queen of Scots and her library, which seems to be a separate topic from the previous discussion about the bookman's collection. The transition here is abrupt. 

In terms of structure, the text moves from one anecdote to another without clear signaling, making it hard to follow the overall argument or theme. The coherence is affected by these abrupt shifts and lack of transitional phrases. 

However, within each section, the ideas are presented logically. For example, the discussion about the bookman's rearranging is coherent in itself, and the historical examples are presented in a logical order. The main issue is the transition between these sections. 

So, coherence issues would be the abrupt transitions and lack of clear connections between different parts of the text. The score here would be around 3 or 3.5, as the text is generally coherent but has noticeable shifts that affect the flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic/obscure terms like "gossips," "conversazione," and "forenoons" may confuse modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentences with multiple clauses (e.g., the 3-sentence block about rearranging shelves) disrupt readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of commas and em dashes in long sentences (e.g., "he does not like it and comforts himself by thrusting in between, as a kind of mediator, Spotswood’s...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from literary analysis of characters (Jeanie Deans) to the bookman’s library habits without transitional context.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from discussing the bookman’s rearranging to inviting historical book collectors (e.g., Cosmo Medici, Mary Queen of Scots) lacks clear thematic connection.  
- [TRANSITION] Disjointed flow between anecdotes about book collecting and the author’s personal reflections on rearrangement.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
