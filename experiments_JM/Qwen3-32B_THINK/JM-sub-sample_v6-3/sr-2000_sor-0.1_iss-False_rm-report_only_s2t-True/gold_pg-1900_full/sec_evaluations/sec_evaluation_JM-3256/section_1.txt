Okay, let's start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section. The previous section isn't available, so I'll focus solely on the given text.

First, I'll check for fluency issues. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through the text sentence by sentence.

The first paragraph seems okay. The sentence structure is complex but grammatically correct. Words like "wherewithal" and "fourpence-halfpenny" are a bit archaic but not incorrect. There's a lot of descriptive language, which is fine. 

Looking for any obvious errors. The sentence starting with "As he was to preside..." has a long structure but is clear. The use of "trifle with literature" is a bit old-fashioned but not an error. The phrase "he had in his courtesy invited me to dinner" – "had in his courtesy" might be a bit awkward, but it's still understandable. 

Next, "he proposed with a certain imposing air that we should visit what he called 'my library.'" The possessive 'my' in quotes is correct. 

Then there's a part about "the gold and white vellum lily upon which the air must not be allowed to blow..." This is a complex metaphor but grammatically correct. 

The sentence structure in "His contentment is to have the flowers..." uses "is to have" which is a bit passive but acceptable. 

In the part about "the books behind doors, and most of all when the doors are locked," the comma usage is correct. 

The sentence "It has seemed to me as if certain old friends looked out from their prison..." is a bit long but still fluent. 

Moving to the next paragraph: "It is said, and now I am going to turn the application of a pleasant anecdote upside down..." The structure is a bit convoluted but grammatically sound. 

The postcard acknowledgment part: "the very essence of English literature." Correct. 

The sentence "being turned loose without the guide of any training..." – "turned loose" is a bit archaic but not incorrect. 

In the paragraph about the bushman: "He fixed as by instinct on the two classics..." The phrase "as by instinct" is a bit awkward but not an error. 

The part about "the tweetling of a minor poet" – "tweetling" is a rare word but correct in context. 

The final paragraph: "So far as I remember, _The Mystery of a Hansom Cab_ and _John Inglesant_ came out somewhat about the same time..." The phrase "somewhat about the same time" is a bit redundant but not incorrect. 

Overall, I don't see any major grammatical errors. The text uses complex sentences and some archaic or literary language, but it's all grammatically correct. There might be some awkward phrasing here and there, but nothing that hinders readability. So fluency is probably a high score, maybe 4.5 or 5.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text starts by defining a bookman, then uses an anecdote about a man with a library, then another anecdote about a colonial squatter. The author connects these examples to argue the point about what makes a true bookman. 

The transition between the two anecdotes is smooth. The author uses phrases like "It is said, and now I am going to turn the application..." to introduce the next story. The conclusion ties both examples together to reinforce the main idea. 

The structure is clear: introduction of the concept, first example, second example, and conclusion. There are no abrupt shifts or confusing transitions. The ideas build on each other logically. 

However, there are some complex sentences that might be a bit dense, but they don't disrupt the overall coherence. The use of metaphors and literary references is consistent with the theme. 

I don't see any major coherence issues. The text is well-structured and the ideas flow logically. So coherence would also be a high score, maybe 4.5 or 5.

Now, looking for any potential issues. In the first anecdote, the host is described in a humorous way, and the author's reaction is clear. The second anecdote about the bushman is introduced with a clear transition. The examples support the thesis effectively. 

Possible minor issues: The sentence "It has seemed to me as if certain old friends looked out from their prison..." is a bit abstract but still fits the metaphor. The phrase "the tweetling of a minor poet" is a bit obscure but not confusing in context. 

Overall, the text is fluent and coherent with only minor issues that don't detract from the overall quality. Therefore, both fluency and coherence would be high scores, maybe 4.5 each.
