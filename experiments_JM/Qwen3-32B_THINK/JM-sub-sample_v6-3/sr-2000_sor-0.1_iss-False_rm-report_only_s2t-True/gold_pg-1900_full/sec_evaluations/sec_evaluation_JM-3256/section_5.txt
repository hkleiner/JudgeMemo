Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. Fluency is about how the text reads in terms of grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I need to look for any issues that might disrupt the flow.

First, I'll scan through the text. The sentences are long and complex, which is common in literary prose, but I need to check for any grammatical errors. For example, in the line "He often drops in, for this is not one of those stores where a tradesman hurries forward to ask what you want and offers you the last novel which has captivated the juicy British palate," the structure is a bit wordy but grammatically correct. 

I notice some instances of run-on sentences. For example, "For a father of this kind will unconsciously inoculate his boy, allowing him to play beside him in the bookroom, where the air is charged with germs (against which there is no disinfectant, I believe, except commercial conversation), and when the child is weary of his toys will give him an old book of travels, with quaint pictures which never depart from the memory." This is a very long sentence with multiple clauses, which might be considered awkward in terms of phrasing. It could be split for better readability, but it's not a grammatical error per se.

There are some idiomatic expressions like "the book microbe was conveyed by the pages" which are metaphorical but not incorrect. The use of phrases like "the bookmanâ€™s wife pleading with him to remember his (once) prosperous home and his (almost) starving children" uses parentheses effectively. 

I don't see any spelling mistakes. The punctuation seems appropriate, though there are a few instances where commas could be used differently, but they don't impede understanding. 

In terms of word choice, the author uses a lot of specific terms related to books and bibliography, which are appropriate for the context. There's a mix of formal and colloquial language, but it's consistent with the style of the text. 

Overall, the fluency is mostly high. There are some long, complex sentences that might be a bit dense, but they don't significantly hinder understanding. So I'd say the fluency score is around 4.5. There are minor issues with sentence structure and phrasing but nothing that disrupts the flow.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about how the ideas are connected and the logical progression of the text. The current section is a continuation of the discussion on bibliomania, comparing it to dipsomania. The author uses examples and anecdotes to illustrate the point. 

The transition from the previous section to this one is smooth, as it continues the discussion on the hereditary aspect of the bookman's disease. The structure of the current section is logical: it starts with the hereditary aspect, discusses the father-son dynamic, provides an anecdote about Quaritch, then moves into the family man's struggles, and concludes with the comparison to dipsomania and the wife's role. 

However, there are a few points where the flow might be a bit abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing the father-son dynamic to the anecdote about Quaritch is a bit sudden. The anecdote serves as a supporting example, but the transition could be smoother. 

Another potential issue is the use of parentheses and asides, such as "(against which there is no disinfectant, I believe, except commercial conversation)" which can sometimes disrupt the flow of the main idea. However, these are used effectively to add commentary rather than to confuse.

The comparison between dipsomania and bibliomania is clear, and the author maintains a consistent theme throughout. The conclusion ties back to the main idea, so the overall structure is coherent. 

There are a few instances where the reader might need to infer connections between ideas, but they are not significant enough to disrupt the overall coherence. Therefore, the coherence score would be around 4.5 as well. The text is mostly coherent with a few minor transitions that could be smoother but don't hinder understanding.
