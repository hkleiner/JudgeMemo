Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to focus on the current section provided. The user wants me to assess fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite old and written in a formal, perhaps archaic style. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. Let me scan through the text.

I notice some old-fashioned spellings like "toadied" (maybe "toadied" is correct in context) and "Bidden" as "Bill Bidden". There's a mix of sentence structures, some complex ones. Are there any grammatical errors? For example, "There was an endless series of Red Indian stories..." seems okay. "One, of course, does not mean..." – the use of "one" as a pronoun might be a bit formal but not incorrect. 

Looking at punctuation: commas are used appropriately in most places. However, some sentences are quite long, which might affect readability. For instance, "It was later that one fell under the power of two more mature and exacting charmers, Mayne Reid’s _Rifle Rangers_ and Dumas’ _Monte Christo_." The structure here is a bit convoluted but still understandable. 

Word choice: Some phrases like "sixpence each" and "humble companions" might be archaic but are part of the style. There's a reference to "Mohammedan" which is outdated, but it's in the original text. 

Are there any spelling errors? I don't see any obvious ones. Syntax-wise, the sentences are complex but not incorrect. The use of passive voice is frequent, which is common in older texts. 

Now for coherence. The text discusses the author's memories of reading books in childhood and their lasting impact. The flow seems logical, moving from Red Indian stories to trapper tales, then to more mature authors like Scott, Thackeray, and Dickens. There's a comparison between different authors and their works. 

However, there are some transitions that feel abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing trapper stories to receiving a letter from a bookman is a bit sudden. Also, the mention of "Bill Bidden" and the value of the book might not be clearly connected to the previous context. 

The text references previous works like "Pilgrim’s Progress" and "Robinson Crusoe" from the context, but since I shouldn't consider the context, I'll focus only on the current section. 

There are some logical jumps, like moving from discussing Indian and trapper stories to the author's later reading of Scott and Thackeray. The connection between these sections isn't always smooth. 

The conclusion about Balzac and the rivalry between "Henry Esmond" and "Heart of Midlothian" might be a bit disjointed. The author compares different works, but the transitions between these comparisons could be smoother. 

Overall, the text is coherent but has some areas where the flow is disrupted by abrupt shifts or unclear transitions. The structure is mostly logical, but the complexity of the sentences and the density of references might make it a bit challenging to follow at times.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or outdated terms ("toadied," "Mohammedan," "sixpence") may confuse modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., "It was later that one fell under the power of two more mature and exacting charmers...") reduce readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in long sentences (e.g., "He also said he was on the track of _Bill Bidden_, another famous trapper, and hoped to send me word that Bill was found...") creates awkward pauses.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from Red Indian stories to receiving a letter from a bookman) disrupt logical flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak transitions between paragraphs (e.g., "It was later that one fell under the power..." follows a detailed anecdote about trapper stories without clear linkage).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to unnamed works (e.g., "another about which I am to speak") leave context unclear.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
