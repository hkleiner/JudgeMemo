Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The text is quite long, so I'll need to go through it carefully. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or awkward phrasing.

Looking at the first sentence: "His modest glass of Burgundy he will cheerfully surrender..." The structure here is a bit inverted, which is a stylistic choice but might be considered a syntax issue. The rest of the sentences seem grammatically correct. 

Next sentence: "and if he ever travelled by any higher class, which is not likely, he will now go third..." The use of "travelled" is the past tense, but it's used in a conditional clause. That's correct. 

Then there's a sentence about his topcoat lasting another year and smoking cigars. The phrasing here is clear. 

The sentence: "Yes, and if he gets a chance to do an extra piece of writing, between 12 and 2 A.M., he will clutch at the opportunity..." The comma after "Yes" is appropriate, and the time format with A.M. is correctly formatted. 

The sentence about calculating shillings and the price negotiation is clear. The phrase "the price to which he has brought down the seller after two days’ negotiations" is a bit complex but grammatically correct. 

The next part about anodynes for his conscience is well-structured. The sentence: "He has also anodynes for his conscience when he seems to be wronging his afflicted family, for is he not gathering the best of legacies for his sons..." The use of "for is he not" is a bit archaic but still grammatically acceptable. 

The sentence about selling the collection and restoring with usury is clear. The phrase "which in passing I may say is a vain dream?" is a bit informal but not incorrect. 

The sentence: "But at any rate, if other men spend money on dinners and on sport, on carved furniture and gay clothing, may he not also have one luxury in life?" The structure here is a bit complex but correct. 

The sentence about his conscience giving painful twinges and leaving the book is clear. The phrase "in hopeless admiration of its marvellous typography" is correctly used. 

The sentence: "and be outside the door before a happy thought strikes him, and he returns to buy it, after thirty minutes’ bargaining, with perfect confidence and a sense of personal generosity." The structure is a bit long but grammatically correct. 

The sentence about the date and the birthday is clear. The use of "To-morrow" with a hyphen is archaic but acceptable. 

The sentence: "To-morrow will be the birthday of a man whom he has known all his days and more intimately than any other person..." The phrase "all his days" is a bit old-fashioned but still correct. 

The sentence about calling the man shocking names is clear. The phrase "which tomcats would be ashamed of" is a bit of a metaphor but not incorrect. 

The sentence: "One thing is certain, the rascal loves a good book and likes to have it when he can..." The structure is clear. 

The sentence about ordering the book to be sent to his address is clear. 

The next paragraph about tastes in pleasure is well-structured. The sentence: "but for the bookman it may be said, beyond any other sportsman, he has the most constant satisfaction..." The phrase "beyond any other sportsman" is a bit awkward but not incorrect. 

The sentence about the spring cleaning and autumn holiday is clear. The phrase "except the spring cleaning which he furiously resents" is correct. 

The sentence about weather and reading in the garden or at the fireside is clear. The use of "Payne’s binding, red morocco" is correctly formatted. 

The sentence about the bookman visiting patients and dictating letters is clear. The phrase "the kindliest for which a man can work or hope to get" is a bit complex but correct. 

The sentence about his friends and their characteristics is clear. The phrase "he is proud when Diana Vernon comes to his room" is correctly used. 

The sentence about reading Coleridge's preaching is clear. The phrase "who, as Lamb said, 'never did anything else'" is correctly formatted with quotes. 

The sentence about William Blake and Michael Angelo is clear. The phrase "he turns to his life of Michael Angelo" is correct. 

The sentence about the bookman being independent of society is clear. The phrase "His friends of this circle will never play him false nor ever take the pet." The use of "take the pet" is a bit informal but not incorrect. 

The sentence about the firelight and familiar faces is clear. 

The sentence about standing in Emerson's room and the last words he wrote is clear. The phrase "the pad on which he wrote them, and the pen with which they were written" is correctly structured. 

The sentence about the bookman growing old and thanking God is clear. The phrase "he thanks God for one which grows the richer for the years and never fades." The structure is a bit complex but correct. 

The sentence about certain books growing dearer with years is clear. The phrase "their pages are worn brown and thin" is correctly used. 

The sentence about Dr. Showell Rogers and his dream is clear. The phrase "a bookman’s paradise" is correctly formatted. 

The sentence about the separation and gratitude to books is clear. The phrase "Between this man at least and his books there will be no separation this side the grave" is a bit complex but correct. 

The sentence about the Book of books is clear. The phrase "nothing can deprive me of my value for such treasures" is a bit awkward but still understandable. 

Overall, the text is quite fluent with some archaic or complex phrasing, but no major grammatical errors. The fluency score would be high, maybe a 4.5 or 5. However, there are a few instances where the structure is a bit awkward or the phrasing is archaic, which might lower the score slightly.

Now for coherence. The text is a continuous narrative about a bookman's habits and thoughts. The ideas flow logically from one to the next, discussing his sacrifices, his conscience, his friends (both real and literary), and his eventual gratitude for his books. 

The transition from the bookman's personal habits to his literary friends is smooth. The mention of specific authors and books adds to the coherence by providing concrete examples. 

The sentence about the birthday and the ruse to buy the book is a bit of a narrative twist but fits within the overall theme of the bookman's behavior. 

The paragraph about his independence from society and his friends is well-connected to the previous ideas. 

The final paragraph about growing old and the Book of books ties back to the initial themes of sacrifice and the value of books. 

There are no abrupt shifts or disconnected ideas. The text maintains a clear progression from the bookman's personal sacrifices to his literary companions and finally to his gratitude for his books. 

However, there is a slight shift in the paragraph about the bookman's friends, where it moves from real friends to literary friends. This transition is clear but might be considered a minor issue in terms of coherence. 

Overall, the coherence is very strong with a clear logical progression. The coherence score would likely be a 5 or 4.5, depending on how strict the evaluation is regarding minor transitions.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Inverted sentence structure in "His modest glass of Burgundy he will cheerfully surrender" creates stylistic awkwardness.
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing like "To-morrow" and "take the pet" may feel dated but is not grammatically incorrect.
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structures (e.g., "the price to which he has brought down the seller after two days’ negotiations") may reduce readability.
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in long sentences (e.g., "and if he ever travelled by any higher class, which is not likely, he will now go third") creates minor readability issues.

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from personal sacrifices to literary companions (e.g., "He will spend the time in the good company of people...") creates a minor disconnect.
- [LOGIC] The narrative twist about the birthday ruse ("What gave him this relief...") is slightly jarring but fits within the broader theme.
- [TRANSITION] Transition between the bookman's personal life and his literary friends lacks explicit connection markers.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
