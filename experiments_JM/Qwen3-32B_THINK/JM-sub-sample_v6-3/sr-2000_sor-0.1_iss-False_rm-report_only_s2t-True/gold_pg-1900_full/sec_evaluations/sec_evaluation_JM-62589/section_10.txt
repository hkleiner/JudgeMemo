Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current text. I need to look for any issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, or punctuation. 

First, I'll read through the section carefully. The sentences are quite long, which might lead to some run-on sentences. For example, in the line "He was a young man, full of ambition and was to return in a week to Philadelphia with a record of bravery and courage to cheer him during his furlough of rest," there's a comma splice. The correct way would be to use a semicolon or split it into two sentences.

Looking for grammar issues, I notice that "Doctor Bell” is sometimes written with a lowercase 'b' later on, like "doctor Bell," which is inconsistent. Also, there's a missing article in "He was a young man, full of ambition and was to return..." – maybe "he was to return" is correct, but the structure is a bit awkward.

There's a possible typo in "Shirtliffe’s splendid constitution regained its tone," where "tone" might be better as "strength" or "health." Also, "Doctor Bell further surprised those who had time to observe him by giving up his comparatively comfortable quarters to the lad he had saved from death." The phrase "comparatively comfortable quarters" is a bit awkward but not incorrect. 

In the line "To meet the surgeon as seldom as he now did, was torture untold," the structure is a bit confusing. It should probably be "To meet the surgeon as seldom as he now did was torture untold," without the comma after 'did.'

Another issue is "he had grown so interested." It should be "he had become so interested" for correct grammar. Also, "He gave up the long looked for furlough" – "looked for" should be hyphenated as "long-looked-for."

There are some instances of inconsistent capitalization, like "Doctor Bell" vs. "doctor Bell." Also, the use of em dashes without proper spacing or punctuation in some places, like "I am going to take you to my mother!”—the em dash here is used correctly but maybe inconsistently with other dashes.

Now, checking coherence. The narrative flows as a story, with a clear progression from the surgeon's concern to the revelation of Debby's identity. However, some transitions are abrupt. For example, after Debby is discharged by Washington, the scene shifts to her in Doctor Bell's mother's home a week later. The transition between these two parts is a bit sudden without a clear bridge.

Also, the character of Debby is introduced as "Shirtliffe" who is actually a girl named Debby Mason. The shift from "Shirtliffe" to "Debby" is handled through dialogue, but it might not be immediately clear to all readers why the name change occurs. The explanation comes later, but the initial shift could be confusing.

There's a mention of "Doctor Bell’s mother a tall, slim girl..." which jumps from the previous scene without a clear transition. The narrative moves from the meeting with Washington to the home of Doctor Bell's mother a week later, which is a bit abrupt.

Additionally, the line "Three cheers!" at the end seems out of place. It might be a leftover from a previous draft or a formatting error, as it doesn't fit the narrative flow.

Considering the evaluation criteria, fluency issues are present but not so severe that they make the text hard to read. Coherence is generally good, but there are some abrupt transitions and unclear shifts in scenes or character identity that could confuse readers. 

For fluency, the main issues are comma splices, inconsistent capitalization, and some awkward phrasing. These are mostly minor and don't severely disrupt reading, so a score of 4 might be appropriate. However, if there are several issues, maybe a 3.5. 

For coherence, the story is mostly logical and connected, but the transitions between scenes and the sudden name change could be problematic. The ending line is also jarring. This might lower the score to a 3.5 or 3. 

I need to check again for any other issues I might have missed. The use of "his" when referring to Debby, who is female, is inconsistent. For example, "He gave up the long looked for furlough..." should be "She," but since the character is presenting as male, it's consistent in context. However, when the identity is revealed, it's clear that "he" refers to Debby, which is a narrative choice. That's acceptable in the story's context, so it's not an issue for coherence.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent and coherent but has some issues that affect the flow and clarity slightly. Final scores would be 4 for fluency and 3.5 for coherence.
