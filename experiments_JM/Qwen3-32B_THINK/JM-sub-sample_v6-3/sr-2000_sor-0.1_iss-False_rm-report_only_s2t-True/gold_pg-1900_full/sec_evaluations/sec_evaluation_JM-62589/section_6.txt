Okay, let's start by looking at the text provided. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence. First, I'll check for fluency issues. Fluency involves grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

Looking at the first part of the current section: "There is mischief on foot, and we must hurry on." That's fine. Then, "Shirtliffe, keeping his face turned as if wincing at the touch, gave the wounded hand to the young officer." The syntax here is a bit complex but still clear. 

Next, "Every moment was precious. The real Morley might return at any minute, Robert did not know he had come and gone..." Wait, "Robert did not know he had come and gone" – the subject here is a bit unclear. Is Robert the one who came and went? Or is it Morley? That might be a clarity issue. 

In the line "That would mean sure death, and in Robert’s breast lay a secret which would give life and hope to the suffering army of men in General Lee’s command." The phrase "in Robert’s breast lay a secret" is a bit awkward. Maybe "Robert carried a secret" would be better. 

Then, "You shiver like a girl, Morley," laughed Harding, as a nervous tremor went over Shirtliffe’s body; "the men in your regiment have talked of your nerve: it can not all have oozed out of this little hole." The colon here might be better as a semicolon, and "can not" should be "cannot" in British English, but the text uses American English, so maybe that's okay. 

Looking further, "He sprang to the saddle, and the tired horse jumped as the weight touched his sore flesh. It was none too soon. The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe, with bowed head dashed on, Morley on his return beat, came up to the group: “My God!” cried Norton and Harding gazing open mouthed at him." The phrase "Morley on his return beat" is confusing. Maybe it's supposed to be "Morley on his return beat" as in "beat the path"? Or is there a missing word here? That seems like a problem.

Moving to the next chapter: "With lowered head, and throbbing nerves, Shirtliffe dashed on in the direction of Boston, but as soon as safety permitted he turned the jaded animal, and breaking into a woodland road, retraced his steps..." The phrase "breaking into a woodland road" – breaking into might be better as "broke into" for past tense consistency. 

In the line "For one moment he thought of the quiet figure by the road which he was leaving forever, but he dared not give a second thought." The pronoun "he" could refer to Shirtliffe or the figure, which is a bit ambiguous. 

There are several instances where the punctuation could be improved, like missing commas or incorrect use of semicolons. For example, "He gave the countersign and dragged on." – maybe a comma after "countersign". 

In terms of coherence, the story is a narrative with a clear progression, but there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from the current segment to the next chapter might be confusing if the context isn't known. However, since the user says to evaluate the current segment on its own, maybe that's okay. 

The characters' actions and motivations are generally clear, but some sentences are a bit convoluted. For example, "He must try and get away, and not be taken into the camp of the Britishers and presented to them who knew the true Morley better, and to Morley himself." The structure here is a bit tangled. 

There are also some repeated phrases or ideas, like the emphasis on the secret and the urgency. However, this might be intentional for dramatic effect. 

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with grammar and word choice, but the text is mostly readable. Coherence is generally good, with a clear narrative flow, though there are a few confusing parts that might disrupt the flow slightly.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "it can not all have oozed out" (should be "cannot" or "can not" with proper spacing)
- [SYNTAX] "Morley on his return beat, came up to the group" (awkward phrasing)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma in "He gave the countersign and dragged on"
- [SYNTAX] "He must try and get away, and not be taken into the camp of the Britishers and presented to them who knew the true Morley better, and to Morley himself" (cumbersome structure)
- [LEXICON] "breaking into a woodland road" (confusing verb choice)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from "Shirtliffe dashed on" to "Morley on his return beat" without clear connection
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between narrative and dialogue in "The rustling among the leaves was no scurrying animal, as Shirtliffe... came up to the group"
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "he" in "For one moment he thought of the quiet figure by the road which he was leaving forever"
- [TRANSITION] Disjointed connection between "He sprang to the saddle" and the subsequent description of the horse's reaction
- [LOGIC] Confusing cause-effect in "The situation was too much for the three men. In silence they gazed into each other’s faces and grew sick with apprehension"
