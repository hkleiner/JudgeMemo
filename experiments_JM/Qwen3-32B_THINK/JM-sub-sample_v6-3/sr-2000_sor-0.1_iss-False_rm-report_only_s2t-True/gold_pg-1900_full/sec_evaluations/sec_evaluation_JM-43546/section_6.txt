Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the current section provided and assess it for fluency and coherence. The user wants me to identify issues and score each on a scale from 1 to 5.

Starting with fluency. I'll scan through the text for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice errors. Let's see:

- "Don by this time was as much interested in 'shopping' as the girls..." The use of "by this time" might be a bit awkward, but it's not a major issue. Maybe a minor syntax problem.
- "Don now led the way to the memorial which was put up to the faithful little dog called 'Grey Friars Bobby.'" The sentence is a bit long but still clear. No obvious grammar issues here.
- "It was put up so that the story might not be forgotten." The phrasing here is a bit passive, but it's acceptable.
- "The monument, in the street without, is in the form of a drinking-fountain..." "Without" here might be confusing. Should it be "outside"? That's a possible word choice issue.
- "He was buried in the same grave with his master..." The correct phrase is usually "in the same grave as his master," so this is a grammar issue.
- "Don pointed out the grave to the little girls, through the railing of the churchyard..." The placement of "through the railing" is a bit awkward. Maybe a syntax issue.
- "So it was, and the young people lost no time in gathering up their belongings..." The use of "So it was" is a bit abrupt but acceptable in narrative style.
- "What one sees at Melrose to-day, however, is only the church of the great institution." "To-day" is hyphenated and might be better as "today." Also, "however" placement could be a minor issue.
- "The rest of the buildings have disappeared with time, for it is over five hundred years since the last of its stones were laid." "Disappeared with time" is a bit passive, but not a major problem.
- "The caretaker unlocked a small door, and they entered what centuries before had been the beautiful abbey church, but was now a ruin..." The structure is a bit complex but still clear.
- "After eating their dinner at one of the old-fashioned inns of the town..." "Old-fashioned inns" is correct.
- "Doctor Gordon stowed his small tourists away in a carriage..." "Stowed away" is a bit informal but not incorrect.
- "chattering most gaily; for while the Scotch people are often very shy and quiet among strangers, they are as lively as possible among themselves." The semicolon usage is correct here.
- "There is Abbotsford now," said Mrs. Gordon, and the children looked eagerly..." The placement of the dialogue tag might be a minor issue but not a major problem.
- "The place is still the property of a member of the Scott family." Correct.
- "Our little party were shown many of the rooms..." Subject-verb agreement: "Our party was shown" would be correct since "party" is singular. This is a grammar issue.
- "There are not too many such days in Scotland; for it is a rainy little country..." The semicolon here is appropriate.
- "There would be no use in staying indoors, for this is the way it is most of the time." The phrasing is a bit awkward but understandable.

So for fluency, the main issues are the subject-verb agreement in "Our party were" and the word choice of "without" instead of "outside." There are also a few minor syntax or phrasing issues, but nothing too severe. The text is mostly fluent with some minor problems.

Now for coherence. I need to check if the ideas flow logically, transitions are smooth, and the structure is clear.

- The text is a narrative that continues from the previous section. The current section talks about the family's shopping, their visit to the Scott Monument, the story of Grey Friars Bobby, their trip to Melrose Abbey, and Abbotsford. The flow seems logical, moving from one location to another with clear transitions.
- The story about Grey Friars Bobby is inserted into the narrative, which is a bit of a digression but still connected to the main action. The transition into and out of the story is smooth.
- The mention of the Border and the history of feuds between Scotch and English is a bit of a shift in topic but is relevant to the visit to Melrose and the connection to Sir Walter Scott.
- The transition from the story of Grey Friars Bobby to the visit to Melrose Abbey is a bit abrupt but still follows the family's journey.
- The section ends with the family visiting Abbotsford and then Dryburgh Abbey, which is a logical progression.
- There are no major abrupt shifts or confusing segments. The narrative moves smoothly from one event to the next with appropriate transitions.

Possible issues could be the insertion of the Grey Friars Bobby story, which might be a minor disruption in the flow, but it's still connected to the overall narrative. The mention of the Border history also fits into the context of their visit to Melrose. Overall, the coherence is strong with minor issues that don't significantly disrupt the flow.

So for coherence, the main issue is the slight digression with the Grey Friars story, but it's handled well. The rest of the text is coherent with logical progression and smooth transitions.

Now assigning scores. For fluency, the text has a couple of grammar issues (subject-verb agreement, word choice) and some minor phrasing issues. But overall, it's mostly fluent. So a 4 might be appropriate. For coherence, the text is mostly coherent with a few minor transitions but nothing major. So a 4.5 or 5. However, the insertion of the Grey Friars story might be a minor coherence issue, so maybe a 4.5. But considering that the transition into and out of that story is smooth, maybe a 5 is acceptable. Wait, the scale for coherence says 5 is highly coherent with minor lapses. Since the story insertion is a minor lapse, maybe a 5 is okay. But if the insertion is considered a minor issue, then 4.5. Hmm. Let me check the scale again.

For coherence score 5: minor lapses, barely noticeable. The Grey Friars story is a bit of a digression but is still connected and the transition is smooth. So maybe it's a minor lapse. So a 5. But if I think it's a bit more noticeable, maybe a 4.5. I'll go with 4.5 for coherence. For fluency, the issues are minor, so a 4.5 as well. Wait, the fluency issues are a couple of grammar problems and a word choice. So maybe 4.5. Let me check the fluency scale again. Score 4 is mostly fluent with minor issues. The text has a couple of minor issues but is mostly fluent. So 4.5 is acceptable.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "Our party were shown" (subject-verb agreement error) - [LEXICON] "in the street without" (likely intended as "outside") - [SYNTAX] "Don pointed out the grave... through the railing" (awkward placement) - [GRAMMAR] "He was buried in the same grave with his master" (incorrect preposition)
2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Grey Friars Bobby's story to Melrose Abbey visit (minor disruption) - [LOGIC] Brief mention of "Border" history feels slightly disconnected from main narrative flow
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
