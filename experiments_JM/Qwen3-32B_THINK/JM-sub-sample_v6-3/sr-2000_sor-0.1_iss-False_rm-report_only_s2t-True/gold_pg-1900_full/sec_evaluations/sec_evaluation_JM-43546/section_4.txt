Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the current section carefully.

First, fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite long, so I'll scan for any obvious errors. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "She dashed on her tam without ever stopping to look in the mirror." The verb "dashed" is used here, which is okay. "Tam" is a Scottish term, so that's correct in context. Next sentence: "Her gloves were more often rolled up in her pocket than on her hands; she never could be made to see why one colour of ribbon was not as good as another..." The semicolon usage here is correct for joining two independent clauses. 

Moving on: "and always wondered why Marjorie made such a fuss over her curls and bows." The sentence structure is fine. 

In the next part: "But in spite of the difference in the two girls they were devoted chums..." "In spite of the difference" is correct, but maybe "differences" would be better if there are multiple, but since it's singular, it's okay. 

Then: "Janet now stood looking at her sister impatiently. "Marjorie," she said, "how many times are you going to tie that bow; we must hurry up Don and Sandy." The semicolon here should be a comma before "we" because it's a dependent clause. That's a punctuation error. 

Next: "Now I am ready, 'Miss Flurry,'" said Marjorie, with a final pat to her bow..." The quotation marks around "Miss Flurry" are correctly used. 

The sentence: "Boules and the button-game, where buttons are thrown toward a hole scooped out in the ground next a wall or a fence, in much the same manner that American boys and girls play marbles, are favourite games with Scotch children." This is a long sentence with a lot of commas. It's a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. 

Moving to the part about buttons: "A button from a soldier's coat is worth ten times as much as an ordinary button, and a coloured button more than a plain white one." The comparison is clear. 

Then: "So you see that loose buttons are very valuable property with a Scotch boy." The phrasing "property with" might be better as "property to" or "to a Scotch boy." Maybe a minor word choice issue. 

In the dialogue: "I can do that," declared Marjorie, as she watched Sandy make several successful shots. The sentence is correct. 

"Marjorie can," said Donald, standing up for his favourite cousin; "let her try." The semicolon here is correct because both clauses are independent. 

The sentence: "The doctor, moreover, had written, in his spare moments, a valuable book on Edinburgh..." The commas around "in his spare moments" are correctly used for non-restrictive clause. 

In the part about Edinburgh: "Edinburgh, you must know, was the capital of Scotland in the old days, and virtually is so to-day..." The commas around "you must know" are correct. 

The sentence: "It was a gay little party that got off an electric car (the Scotch call it "electric," as do the Americans, and not a "tram," as do their English cousins just over the border), Doctor Gordon leading the way..." The parentheses and commas are correctly used. 

Looking for any spelling errors: "tam-o'-shanter" is correctly spelled with the hyphen. "Boules" is the correct spelling for the game. "Cairngorm" is spelled correctly. 

Syntax-wise, the sentences are mostly straightforward, though some are long and complex. The use of commas and semicolons is generally correct. 

Now, coherence. The text is a narrative about the girls and their walk with the doctor. The flow of ideas is logical, moving from their preparation to the game, then the walk through Edinburgh, the castle, and the historical context. 

Possible issues: The transition from the button game to the historical parts about the clans and tartans might be a bit abrupt, but it's part of the educational narrative. The mention of the piper and his uniform is well-explained. 

The coherence seems strong, with each paragraph leading naturally to the next. There are no major logical gaps or repetitions. The dialogue between the characters helps maintain the flow. 

For fluency, the main issue is the semicolon in the dialogue tag. For coherence, the structure is mostly smooth, but maybe the shift from the game to the historical facts could be a minor transition issue. 

So, fluency score: 4.5 (mostly fluent with minor punctuation issues). Coherence score: 4.5 (mostly coherent with smooth progression, minor transitions).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [PUNCTUATION] Incorrect semicolon in dialogue tag ("how many times are you going to tie that bow; we must hurry up Don and Sandy"). - [SYNTAX] Cumbersome phrasing in long descriptive sentences (e.g., "Boules and the button-game... are favourite games with Scotch children"). - [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing ("property with a Scotch boy" instead of "to a Scotch boy").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from button-game explanation to historical context of clans/tartans. - [STRUCTURE] Slight inconsistency in narrative flow when moving from dialogue to descriptive historical asides.  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
