Alright, let's evaluate the text based on the given criteria. First, I need to look at the fluency and coherence issues.

Starting with fluency: I notice some grammatical issues. For example, in the sentence "He wanted to enjoy it in Scotland, his own country, however, for the Scotch are very clannish..." the placement of "however" is a bit awkward. Also, there's a comma splice in "So he came back to Scotland, and bought a fine estate with a beautiful house, into which he put handsome furniture and good pictures and books,--everything that could make a home attractive." The em dash is used incorrectly here. Additionally, some phrases are a bit wordy, like "To Donald it seemed a palace, and he did not think the king himself had anything so grand." The sentence structure is repetitive and could be more concise. There's also a missing comma after "Donald was amazed, too, at the tales..." which affects readability.

Moving on to coherence: The text flows well overall, but there are some transitions that could be smoother. The shift from talking about Uncle Alan's estate to the stories Don told Sandy about the gamekeeper is a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of the puppy "doggie" and the naming process seems a bit out of place in the middle of discussing Uncle Alan's background. The transition to the school-days chapter is a new section, but it's clear. However, the connection between the previous context about the cousins visiting and the new chapter about school and holidays is a bit jarring. Some sentences, like the one about porridge and the old bowl, are a bit tangential and might not connect as smoothly with the rest of the narrative. The explanation about marmalade's origin is a bit off-topic and could disrupt the flow for some readers.

For the final scores: Fluency has a few issues but they're minor and don't significantly disrupt the reading. Coherence is mostly good with some minor disconnects. So, I'd give Fluency a 4 and Coherence a 4.5.
