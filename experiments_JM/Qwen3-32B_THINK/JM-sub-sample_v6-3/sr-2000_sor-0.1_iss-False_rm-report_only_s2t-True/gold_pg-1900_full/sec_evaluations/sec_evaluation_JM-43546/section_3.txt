Okay, let me start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The text is quite long, so I'll need to go through it carefully.

First, I'll look for grammar issues. There's a sentence: "The schools and colleges in Scotland are among the best in the world, and there is nothing a Scotsman prizes more, whether he be rich or poor, than a good education." The phrase "whether he be rich or poor" uses the subjunctive mood, which is correct here. So no issue there.

Next, check for spelling. I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "Scotch Universities," "marmalade," and "currant buns" are spelled correctly.

Now, syntax and phrasing. The sentence structure is generally clear. However, some sentences are quite long, which might affect readability. For example, the paragraph about the French words in Scotch speech has several run-on sentences. For instance: "You will find that the Scotch use many words which must have come originally from the French, though most of them have been changed so much that the real French words wouldn't know them for cousins even." This is a long sentence with a complex structure that could be broken into shorter ones for better fluency.

Punctuation seems mostly correct, but there's a lack of commas in some places where they might be needed for clarity. For example: "Don called his napkin a 'serviette,' which is just the same as in French; and was very fond of eating 'petticoat-tails' at tea-time,--a name which you would never imagine came from the 'petits-gateaux' of the French, meaning 'little cakes.'" The semicolon after "French" is appropriate, but the em dash after "tea-time" might be better as a comma or a colon.

Word choice and phrasing: The text uses some old-fashioned or regional terms like "laddie," "kirk," and "tewky," which are appropriate for the context but might be unfamiliar to some readers. However, the author does provide explanations, so that's okay.

Looking for awkward phrasing: "You probably wonder what that is. Well, it is simply a leg of mutton, and comes from the French word 'gigot.'" The transition from "Well" here is a bit abrupt but not a major issue.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent with minor issues in sentence structure and punctuation that could be improved. There are a few long sentences that might benefit from being split, but they don't significantly hinder understanding. So I'd give fluency a 4.5.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative that transitions between different topics: education, games, food, history, and daily life. The flow is generally logical, but there are a few abrupt shifts.

For example, the section about the game "Beezee" transitions into the description of dinner and then into the history of French influence in Scottish language. The shift from games to food to history is a bit jarring. There's a lack of smooth transitions between these sections. The author uses phrases like "Well, he has greatly helped..." to connect ideas, but it's not always seamless.

Another issue is the sudden jump from discussing the game to the history of France and Scotland. The sentence "In the old days there was a strong friendship between Scotland and France..." comes after talking about a game, which might confuse the reader. The connection is made through the French words in Scottish speech, but the transition could be smoother.

There's also a shift from the boys' daily activities to the history of golf, which is then followed by a mention of Newhaven fishwives. These are all related to Scottish culture but are presented in a way that feels a bit disjointed.

The paragraph about the boys' Sundays and the strict observance of the Sabbath is a different topic altogether, introduced without a clear transition from the previous section on golf. This could disrupt the flow.

However, the text does maintain a general theme of Scottish culture and daily life, so the overall coherence is decent. The issues are in the transitions between specific topics. The narrative could use more connecting phrases to link these different elements smoothly.

Considering these points, the coherence is mostly good but has noticeable abrupt shifts. The score would be around 4, as the text is generally coherent but has some weak transitions that affect the flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses (e.g., "You will find that the Scotch use many words which must have come originally from the French, though most of them have been changed...").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of punctuation in compound sentences (e.g., missing commas in "Don called his napkin a 'serviette,' which is just the same as in French; and was very fond of eating...").  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or regional terms without sufficient contextualization (e.g., "tewky," "kirk").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between unrelated topics (e.g., from "Beezee" to historical French-Scottish relations).  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shifts in narrative focus (e.g., from daily routines to golf history, then to Newhaven fishwives).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connections between paragraphs (e.g., transition from Sunday observance to the "Ladies' Fashion Page" anecdote).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
