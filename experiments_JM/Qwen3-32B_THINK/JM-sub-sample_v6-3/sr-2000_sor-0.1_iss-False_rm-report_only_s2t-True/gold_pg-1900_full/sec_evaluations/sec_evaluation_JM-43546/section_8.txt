Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Analysis:

I'll go through the text and identify any issues with grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text, I notice a few issues:
1. [GRAMMAR] "Don was gotten up as 'Rob Roy'" - "was gotten up" is an awkward phrasing; "was dressed up" would be more natural.
2. [GRAMMAR] "which got in his way most of the time" - The sentence structure is awkward and could be clearer.
3. [GRAMMAR] "The children had barely time to exhibit themselves before the company began to come" - This sentence has an awkward structure that makes it slightly confusing.
4. [SPELLING] "Merry Metanzie" - This appears to be a misspelling of "Merry Maenzie" or "Merry Mumsie" which are traditional Scottish games.
5. [GRAMMAR] "The MacPhersons and the Gordons were all sitting in the library of Kelvin House, to see the old year out and the new year in" - The phrasing is awkward and could be clearer.
6. [GRAMMAR] "Doctor Gordon pulled out his watch every little while to be sure that the clock had not stopped" - The phrasing is awkward.
7. [GRAMMAR] "One morning a shrill whistle brought Sandy to his garden wall" - The phrasing is awkward and could be more natural.
8. [GRAMMAR] "There is a great fanfare by the trumpeters, after which the king's message is read out to the people assembled" - The sentence structure is awkward.
9. [GRAMMAR] "There is another fanfare blown on the long trumpets, which have gorgeous banners hanging from them, after which the band plays 'God Save the King,' and the people all take off their hats" - The sentence is long and could be split for clarity.
10. [GRAMMAR] "What was it all about? Well, it was St. Patrick's Day, the seventeenth of March, and when any of the Scotch and Irish lads met on that day, there was bound to be a battle between them" - The phrasing is awkward and could be clearer.

Overall, these are relatively minor issues that don't significantly impact readability, but they do affect the fluency of the text.

## Coherence Analysis:

I'll look at how the text flows as a whole, including logical sequencing, transitions between ideas, and overall structure.

Looking at the text:
1. [STRUCTURE] The text transitions from one event to another (birthday party, Hogmanay celebration, St. Patrick's Day) without clear transitions or connections between them.
2. [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different events and times without clear indication of when or how these events are related.
3. [LOGIC] The text moves from a birthday party to a discussion of Scottish customs to a St. Patrick's Day battle without clear connections or transitions.
4. [CLARITY] Some references are unclear without additional context, such as the "little 'tewky'" and the "gillie" mentioned.
5. [LOGIC] The text mixes descriptions of specific events with general descriptions of customs without clear differentiation.
6. [LOGIC] The text sometimes shifts perspective abruptly, such as from a narrative voice to direct quotes or from one character's perspective to another.
7. [STRUCTURE] The text is written in a somewhat episodic style, with each paragraph describing a different event or custom without a clear overarching structure.
8. [LOGIC] The text sometimes introduces new concepts without explanation, such as the "first-footing" tradition.
9. [LOGIC] The text moves from describing a birthday party to discussing Christmas and New Year customs without clear transitions.

The text has a clear narrative thread in the birthday party section, but the shift to discussing Scottish customs and then to the St. Patrick's Day battle is less coherent. The structure is somewhat fragmented, with each paragraph describing a different event or custom.

Based on these observations:

For Fluency, I would rate the text a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with clear, natural phrasing, but contains a few minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasing that slightly affect readability.

For Coherence, I would rate the text a 3.5. The text has a clear narrative in some sections but suffers from noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions between different events and topics, and some confusing segments that affect the overall coherence.
