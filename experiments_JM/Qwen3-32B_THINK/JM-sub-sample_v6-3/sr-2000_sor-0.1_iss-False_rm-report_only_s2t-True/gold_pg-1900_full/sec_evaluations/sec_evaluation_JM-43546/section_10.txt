Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [PUNCTUATION] The text contains several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation, such as the use of a dash without proper punctuation in "Don and Sandy were having some hot discussions as to which was the finest city in Scotland,--Glasgow or Edinburgh."
2. [PUNCTUATION] There are some missing commas in lists, such as in "and the truth of it all was, both boys were right."
3. [PUNCTUATION] The text has some inconsistent punctuation usage, such as in "There are so many delightful journeys to be made from Glasgow by rail and steamer that it is one of the best starting points in all Scotland for excursions, of which all children and most old folks are so fond."
4. [GRAMMAR] There is a grammatical issue in "the young people might enjoy more of these rare treats, and take some of the lovely sails on the river Clyde and among the near-by islands." The verb "take" doesn't properly match with "sails."
5. [PUNCTUATION] The text contains some missing or incorrect punctuation at the end of sentences, such as in "Didn't they have a splendid time on this trip!"

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps from one location to another with minimal transitional phrases, making it sometimes difficult to follow the progression of the journey.
2. [TRANSITION] The narrative shifts from the Lindsays and Gordons' trip to Glasgow to a completely different story about "some young American cousins" coming to visit with little to no transition.
3. [LOGIC] The text mentions "that's another story!" but doesn't provide any clear indication of what that story is or how it connects to the current narrative.
4. [CLARITY] The text mentions "our little Scotch cousins" and "some young American cousins" without clearly establishing who these characters are in relation to the main narrative.
5. [LOGIC] The text concludes abruptly with "So many little cousins are waiting to talk about themselves that we must really get our little Clan safely back home..." without a smooth transition from the previous narrative about the trip.

Based on these issues, I would rate:

For Fluency: There are several punctuation issues and one grammatical issue, but the text is generally readable and the issues don't severely disrupt comprehension. I would rate this a 4 (mostly fluent with some minor issues).

For Coherence: There are some logical jumps and transitions, but the overall narrative flows reasonably well and the story is generally easy to follow. I would rate this a 3.5 (generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections in places).
