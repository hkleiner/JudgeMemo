Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The first thing I notice is that the text is quite long and detailed, which can sometimes lead to issues. I'll need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking at the sentences, they are generally well-structured. However, there are a few instances where the syntax is a bit awkward. For example, "It was James VI. of Scotland who afterward became James I. of England" uses "afterward" which is correct, but the sentence could be smoother. Also, the use of "VI." and "I." with periods might be a stylistic choice, but it's a bit old-fashioned and could be considered a minor issue.

There are some instances of repetition. For example, "The children were always greatly interested in the 'Dogs' Cemetery,' where are buried all the dogs of the regiment, and each time they came to the castle they always looked to see if there was another little grave..." The repetition of "always" might be a minor issue for fluency. Also, "we have remained ever since" is correct but a bit wordy.

Spelling seems correct throughout. The punctuation is generally good, though there are a few places where commas could be used more effectively to separate clauses. For example, in the sentence "It was James VI. of Scotland who afterward became James I. of England, and thus, for the first time, Scotland and England were united under one crown." The comma after "thus" is correctly used.

Word choice is mostly appropriate. The use of archaic terms like "Scotch" instead of "Scottish" might be intentional for historical context, but it's a bit inconsistent with modern usage. However, since the text is set in a historical context, this might be acceptable.

Overall, there are a few minor issues in grammar and syntax, but they don't significantly disrupt the flow. The text is mostly fluent, so I would rate it a 4.5 in fluency.

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a narrative that follows the children's tour and their interactions. The flow is logical and the ideas are connected smoothly. The transitions between different parts of the story are generally well-handled. For example, moving from the castle to Holyrood Palace and then to the University of Edinburgh makes sense in the context of a walking tour.

However, there are a few instances where the progression is a bit abrupt. For example, the transition from discussing the "Dogs' Cemetery" to the doctor showing them the parapet and the steep wall is a bit sudden. The connection between these two parts isn't immediately clear, which could cause a slight disruption in coherence.

Another point is the mention of the "Dogs' Cemetery" and the children checking for new graves. The text then shifts to Janet asking about Holyrood Palace, which is a smooth transition, but the mention of the cemetery might be a bit out of place in the flow of the narrative.

There's also a minor issue with the use of "Scotch" versus "Scottish," which might cause a slight inconsistency in the narrative's tone. However, this is more of a stylistic choice and doesn't significantly affect coherence.

The overall structure is logical, with each section building on the previous one. The narrative maintains a clear focus on the children's experiences and their educational tour. The flow is mostly smooth, with only a few minor disruptions.

Considering these points, the coherence is mostly strong, with only a couple of minor issues that don't significantly impact the overall flow. I would rate the coherence as a 4.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "we have remained ever since" (wordy).  
- [LEXICON] Inconsistent use of "Scotch" vs. "Scottish" (historical vs. modern terminology).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma in "It was James VI. of Scotland who afterward became James I. of England and thus..." (should be "and, thus,").  
- [REPETITION] Redundant use of "always" in "The children were always greatly interested... and each time they came to the castle they always looked..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from "Dogs' Cemetery" to the doctor describing the steep rock climb (abrupt transition).  
- [LOGIC] Slight disconnection between the historical narrative and the childrenâ€™s modern-day tour (e.g., "we have remained ever since" follows a detailed historical explanation).  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "the blood-stains of Rizzio" (unclear if literal or symbolic).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
