Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. I need to look for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice issues. First, I'll scan through the text.

The first paragraph seems okay. The sentence structure is clear. Then, "If the ball hit him, as it frequently did, the player waiting for it was at liberty either to play it or claim a let." The grammar here is correct. 

Next, "Worse was to follow, however." That's a common transition phrase. 

Looking at "One day Eileen and the curate conducted Excalibur to a neighboring mountain range--at least, so it appeared to Excalibur--and played another ball game." The em dashes are used correctly here. 

In the part about the golf game: "After having been struck for the third time by one of these balls he whipped round, picked it up in his mouth and gave it a tiny pinch, just as a warning." The comma before 'just as a warning' is correct. 

Then, "The ball retaliated with unexpected ferocity. It twisted and turned. It emitted long, snaky spirals of some elastic substance, which clogged his teeth and tickled his throat and wound themselves round his tongue and nearly choked him." The sentence structure here is a bit long but still readable. 

In "Panic-stricken, he ran to his mistress, who, with weeping and with laughter, removed the writhing horror from his jaws and comforted him with fair words." The use of commas is correct. 

Moving on to the golf part: "It was a boring business, though, and very exhausting, for he loathed exercise of every kind; and his only periods of repose were the occasions on which the expedition came to a halt on certain small, flat lawns, each of which contained a hole with a flag in it." The semicolon is used correctly here. 

The part about the hare: "The hare, which was suffering from extreme panic, owing to a terrifying noise behind it,--the blast of the newest and most vulgar motor horn, to be precise,--was bolting right across the clearing." There's an em dash after "it," but it's followed by a comma. That might be a punctuation issue. The correct usage would be either both em dashes or both commas. So that's a possible [PUNCTUATION] issue. 

Looking at "After the manner of hares where objects directly in front of them are concerned, the fugitive entirely failed to perceive Excalibur and, indeed, ran right underneath him on its way to cover." The phrase "where objects directly in front of them are concerned" is a bit awkward. It might be better phrased as "when objects directly in front of them are concerned." So that's a [SYNTAX] or [LEXICON] issue. 

In the dialogue section, the quotes are correctly formatted. The use of em dashes and commas in dialogue seems correct. 

In "They looked not so much at Excalibur as through him." That's a common phrase and correct. 

The part where Eileen and the curate are discussing their financial situation: "A hundred pounds a year!" repeated the curate. "A pass degree and no influence! I can't preach and I have no money of my own. Dearest, I ought never to have told you." The dialogue is well-punctuated. 

The phrase "If we could rent a three-shilling cottage and I could go about with a spotted handkerchief round my neck, and you could scrub the doorsteps coram populo, we might be very comfortable;" "coram populo" is a Latin term, but since it's in quotes and explained contextually, it's acceptable. 

The sentence structure in the dialogue between Eileen and the curate is clear. 

Overall, I notice a few minor issues with punctuation and some awkward phrasing, but nothing that severely disrupts the flow. So the fluency score would likely be a 4 or 4.5. 

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative that follows Excalibur's experiences with Eileen and the curate. The transitions between events are generally smooth. The story moves from the tennis court to the golf game, then to the country walks, and finally to the dialogue between Eileen and the curate. 

The shift from Excalibur's perspective to the human characters' dialogue is a bit abrupt in the middle. The transition from the hare incident to the conversation about finances might feel sudden, but it's part of the narrative flow. 

The dialogue itself is coherent, with clear progression in their discussion. However, the shift from Excalibur's experiences to the human characters' emotional conversation might not be as smoothly connected. 

The story does maintain a logical sequence, and the ideas are connected. There's a clear progression of events. However, the transition from the hare incident to the human dialogue is a bit jarring. 

Considering these points, the coherence might be a 4, as there are a few minor transitions that could be smoother but don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding.
