Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user provided a current section that's part of a longer story. I need to check for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice issues that might affect how smoothly the text reads.

First, I'll go through each sentence. The first part is "She's rocking!" followed by the commercial traveler's actions. The sentence structure here seems okay. There's a comma after "boots," which is part of an em dash, but maybe the em dash should be a hyphen or the punctuation is correct. The sentence "commercial travelers always remove their boots in third-class railroad compartments when on night journeys," has a comma splice. It should probably be a period or a semicolon. 

Next, "After the first shock the train had gathered way again--the light engine into which it had charged had been thrown clear off the track--but only for a moment." The use of em dashes here is correct, but maybe the sentence is a bit long and complex. 

Looking at "It was a corridor train, and unfortunately for Gerald Gilmore and the commercial traveler their coach fell over corridor side downward." The phrase "corridor side downward" is a bit awkward. Maybe "corridor-side downward" with a hyphen would be clearer. 

In "Once he got the window open, the curate experienced little difficulty in getting through; but the commercial traveler was corpulent and tenacious of his boots..." The semicolon usage is correct here. 

In "He turned and ran. Almost at his first step he cannoned into a heavy body in rapid motion. It was Excalibur." The sentence structure is fine, but "cannoned into" is a bit of a strong word, but it's appropriate given the context. 

In "He spoke at the direction of a big man in a heavy overcoat..." The phrase "at the direction of" is a bit awkward. Maybe "toward the direction of" would be better. 

Overall, the text has some minor punctuation and phrasing issues but nothing that severely disrupts the flow. So fluency is mostly fluent but with a few issues, which would put it around a 4.

Now for coherence. The text continues the story from the previous chapter, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the transitions between sentences and paragraphs are smooth. 

The transition from the train accident to the aftermath is logical. The introduction of characters like the curate and the commercial traveler is clear. The mention of Excalibur as a dog that helps is a bit sudden but makes sense in context. 

The dialogue between the curate and Lord Caversham is coherent, and the progression of their conversation is logical. The ending of the current section leads into the next chapter smoothly, indicating that the text is part of a larger narrative. 

However, there's a slight jump when introducing Excalibur as a dog that helps the curate, but since it's a fantasy element, it's acceptable. The overall structure is coherent, with clear cause and effect in the events described. 

There are a few minor transitions that could be smoother, like the shift from the accident to the aftermath, but nothing major. So coherence is mostly coherent with a few minor issues, leading to a score of 4 as well.
