Okay, let me start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I need to check for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice issues. The text is quite long, but I'll go through it carefully.

Looking at the first part: "And the curate kissed her very solemnly." The sentence is fine. Next, "A secret is a comfortable thing to lovers, especially when they are young and about to be lonely." The structure here is okay, though "comfortable thing to lovers" might be a bit awkward. Maybe "for lovers" is better than "to lovers," but it's not a major issue. 

Then there's "supported on a lumbering and ill-balanced body." The phrase "lumbering and ill-balanced" is descriptive but maybe a bit wordy. Not a problem. 

Moving on, "It was Excalibur, taking sanctuary with the Church from the vengeance of the Law." The phrasing is clear. 

In the next paragraph: "Eileen communicated the great news to Excalibur." The sentence is straightforward. 

The dialogue seems fine, with proper punctuation. 

Now, looking at the chapter transition to "CHAPTER: VI". The capitalization here is a bit inconsistent with the rest of the text, but that's more of a formatting issue, not a fluency problem. 

In the next section: "He was getting a hundred and twenty pounds a year now; so his chances of becoming a millionaire had increased by twenty per cent." The semicolon usage is correct. 

The sentence "Eileen was still the recognized beauty of the district, but she spread her net less promiscuously than of yore." "Of yore" is an archaic term, but it's used correctly here. 

There's a part where it says "He and Eileen walked together, rain or shine, on Friday afternoons to post the letter in the next village." The structure is a bit long, but it's clear. 

Then, "The curate was seen no more in his old parish. Railroad journeys are costly things and curates' holidays rare." The transition between sentences is smooth. 

In the section about Excalibur's transfer: "he had no means of checking her movements; but the chances are that she never saw the curate, or I think she would have told Excalibur about it." The semicolon usage here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit complex. 

The part about the brother-in-law falling ill: "There was an operation and a crisis, and a deal of unhappiness at Much Moreham; then came convalescence, followed by directions for a sea voyage of six months." The semicolon is correctly used to join two independent clauses. 

The train journey description: "He traveled in the guard's van, it having been found quite impossible to get him into an ordinary compartment--or, rather, to get any one else into the compartment after he lay down on the floor." The em dash is used appropriately here. 

In the London section: "Excalibur spent the rest of the day in London, where it must be admitted he caused a genuine sensation--no mean feat in such a blas√© place." The em dash is used correctly. 

The sentence "He had gone there under some confused impression that it was the guard's van again--said good-bye for the last time; and Eileen, smiling bravely, was whirled away out of sight." The semicolon is correctly used here. 

Overall, the text is mostly fluent. There are a few instances where the word choice or structure could be slightly improved, but nothing that disrupts the flow or understanding. The use of semicolons and em dashes is appropriate in most cases. There are no major grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would significantly affect readability. I might give a score of 4.5 for fluency, as there are minor issues but nothing major.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative with a clear progression of events. The story moves from the curate and Eileen's secret, their continued correspondence, Excalibur's role, the brother-in-law's illness, and the journey to London. The transitions between paragraphs are smooth, and the narrative maintains a logical flow. 

However, there are a few points where the coherence could be slightly questioned. For example, the sudden shift to the coroner's jury and the accident in Chapter VII might be a bit abrupt if not for the context. But since this is a chapter transition, it's expected. 

The connection between Excalibur's actions and the curate's journey is maintained throughout. The cause-effect relationships are clear. The use of dialogue and descriptions helps in maintaining the narrative flow. 

The only minor issue is the transition from the London events back to the curate's journey in Chapter VII. The mention of the coroner's jury and the accident is a new plot point, but it's introduced smoothly. 

Overall, the text is highly coherent with a clear narrative structure. There are no major inconsistencies or abrupt shifts that would confuse the reader. The story progresses logically, and the relationships between characters and events are well-maintained. A score of 4.5 for coherence seems appropriate, as there are no significant issues that would disrupt the reader's understanding.
