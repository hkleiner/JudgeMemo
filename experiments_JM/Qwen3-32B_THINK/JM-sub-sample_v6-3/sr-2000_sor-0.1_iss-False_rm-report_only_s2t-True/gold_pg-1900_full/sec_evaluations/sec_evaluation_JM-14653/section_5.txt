Alright, let's start by carefully reading the current section to evaluate its fluency and coherence. 

First, for **fluency**, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite long and complex, so I'll look for any awkward phrasing or errors.

Looking at the first paragraph: "The fancy of some people will at once run to the formation of a grand international Society..." The structure here is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. There are some run-on sentences, like the one that continues with "headquarters--of course at the Hague..." The em dash usage is correct, but the sentence is lengthy. 

Next: "To my mind, most societies with a moral aim are merely clumsy machines for doing simple jobs with the maximum of friction, expense and inefficiency." The word "clumsy machines" is a metaphor, but the sentence is clear. No obvious grammar issues here.

In the paragraph starting with "You can best help the general cultivation of goodwill along by cultivating goodwill in your own heart..." The phrase "along by" seems a bit awkward. Maybe "along by cultivating" could be smoother as "by cultivating". Also, "you will probably assume that there will be time left over for superintending..." The word "superintending" is a bit archaic and might be less common, but it's used correctly. 

The sentence "You will perceive, if not at once, later, that you have bitten off just about as much as you can chew." The structure is a bit jarring, but it's understandable. 

In the paragraph about choosing a small group: "And in this group of people you will be wise, while neglecting no member of the group, to specialise on one member." The phrasing is a bit awkward, but the meaning is clear. 

The part about the butler: "He may be your butler. Or you may be his butler." The repetition of "butler" is intentional for emphasis, so it's stylistic. 

The sentence "She may be your daughter, or he may be your father, and you a charming omniscient girl of seventeen wiser than anybody else." The structure is complex but grammatically correct. 

In the paragraph about the method of cultivating goodwill: "The frequency of your early failures with him or her will show you how prudent you were not to make an attempt on the whole of humanity at once." The phrasing is a bit convoluted but still clear. 

The paragraph starting with "I now come to the actual method of cultivating goodwill." This is straightforward. 

Moving to the chapter on "THE GIFT OF ONESELF": The paragraph about children and adults is well-structured. 

In the paragraph: "To be his friend means an effort on your part, it means that you must divest yourself of your own mental habit..." The comma splice is an issue here. It should be two sentences or a semicolon. 

The sentence "With five minutes of genuine surrender to him, you can win more of his esteem and gratitude than five hundred pounds would buy." The comparison is a bit jarring but the sentence is clear. 

The paragraph about imagination: "You must inform yourself about all his activities. You must be able in your mind's eye to follow him hour by hour throughout the day..." The structure is clear and the sentences are well-formed. 

In the sentence: "You must reflect upon his existence with the same partiality as you reflect upon your own. (Why not?)" The parenthetical "Why not?" is a bit abrupt but stylistically acceptable. 

Overall, there are a few minor issues like comma splices, some awkward phrasing, and a few run-on sentences, but the text is mostly fluent with only minor issues.

Now, for **coherence**, I need to check the logical flow, transitions between ideas, and overall structure. 

The current section starts by discussing the formation of a society for cultivating goodwill, then shifts to the author's opinion against such societies. This transition is clear. 

The author then argues that cultivating goodwill is a personal effort, not something to be done through societies. This is a logical progression. 

The next section discusses choosing a small group of people to focus on, and then narrowing down to one person. This is a coherent structure. 

The part about the method of cultivating goodwill through imagination is a natural progression from the previous points. 

The chapter on "THE GIFT OF ONESELF" introduces a new angle with children and adults, which is a logical extension of the discussion on goodwill. 

There are transitions like "I now come to the actual method..." which help the flow. 

However, there are some abrupt shifts in the middle, like the sudden mention of children and adults after discussing personal cultivation of goodwill. This could be a minor issue in coherence, but it's part of the author's argument structure. 

Overall, the text has a clear structure and logical progression, though there are a few points where the flow could be smoother. The main ideas are connected and the argument is coherent.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence in "headquarters--of course at the Hague; and committees..." (excessive length with multiple clauses)
- [GRAMMAR] Comma splice in "To be his friend means an effort on your part, it means that you must divest..."
- [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing in "superintending the cultivation" and "bitten off just about as much as you can chew"
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "And you will appreciate also the wisdom of not advertising your enterprise"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from personal cultivation to children/adults dynamic feels abrupt
- [TRANSITION] Jump from "I now come to the actual method..." to discussing children lacks smooth connection
- [LOGIC] Slightly confusing sequence in discussing "the whole of humanity" before narrowing to specific individuals
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "he or she who oftenest inspires you with a feeling of irritated superiority"

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
