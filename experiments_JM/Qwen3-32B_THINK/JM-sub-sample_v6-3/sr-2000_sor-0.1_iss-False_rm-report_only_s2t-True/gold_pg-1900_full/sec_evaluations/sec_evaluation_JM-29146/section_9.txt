Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. I need to check for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, word choice, and phrasing. 

Looking through the text, I notice a few instances where the grammar seems off. For example, in the line "You didn't breathe on a timeless world. You merely--somehow--existed," the em dashes are used correctly for a pause, but the structure is a bit abrupt. There's also "The Enterprise was empty." followed by "Garr Symm looked doubtfully at the gray murkiness behind them." The transition here is smooth, but the word "doubtfully" is a bit awkward in describing someone's gaze. 

Another example is "You couldn't use it here, without the passage of time since time does not exist here." The repetition of "here" might be redundant. Additionally, in the line "The scaly green face of the Irwadi within the space-suit grimaced with pain. He doubled over and fell, his helmet shattering against the ground at Ramsey's feet," the use of "his helmet shattering" is clear, but the sentence structure is a bit complex and could be simplified for better fluency.

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a continuation of a story, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are any abrupt shifts or unclear transitions. The context mentions a "timeless continuum" and the effects on weapons and breathing. The current segment continues this with characters interacting with the teleporter and the matter-transmitter. 

One issue is the sudden appearance of "five new figures" without prior setup, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context. Also, the transition from Ramsey's vision to the action with the Irwadi is abrupt. The line "It was Garr Symm's voice." introduces a new element without clear connection to the previous paragraph. 

Another point is the explanation of the Irwadi's death. The text states that death shouldn't be possible on a timeless world, but then describes the Irwadi dying from lack of air. This contradiction could be confusing unless the context explains it. The paragraph about the Irwadi's death is detailed but might disrupt the flow if the reader isn't aware of the rules established earlier.

In terms of structure, the text moves from dialogue to action to exposition, which is generally okay, but some transitions are abrupt. The explanation of the matter-transmitter and its implications is clear, but the connection to the previous events could be smoother. 

Overall, the fluency has minor issues that don't severely impact readability, so a score around 4.5. Coherence has a few points where the flow is disrupted, but the story is generally logical and connected, so a score around 4.
