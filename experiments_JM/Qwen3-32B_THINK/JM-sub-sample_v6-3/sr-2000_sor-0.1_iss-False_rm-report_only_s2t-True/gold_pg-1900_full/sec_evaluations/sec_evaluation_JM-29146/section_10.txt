Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user wants me to check for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, etc. I'll go through the current section and see what stands out.

First, I notice some possible grammar issues. For example, in the sentence "The man of Irwadi fell, his helmet cracked, he tried to scream--and died." The structure here is a bit awkward. It's a run-on sentence without a proper conjunction. It should probably be split into two sentences or use a semicolon. Also, "The man of Irwadi" – maybe "the Irwadi man" is more natural.

Then there's a part where it says "I am not a Vegan girl." The term "Vegan girl" might be a typo. It's more likely "Vegan" is a proper noun, maybe "Vegan" as a title or a specific group, so it should be capitalized. Wait, in the context, Vardin says, "I am not a Vegan girl," but earlier she was referred to as a Proto-man. Maybe "Vegan" is a typo for "Proto-man"? Or perhaps it's correct, but the capitalization is off.

Another example: "You'll be good for each other, Ramsey, you and the girl." The word order here is a bit off. It should probably be "You and the girl will be good for each other." The current structure is awkward and might confuse the reader.

Looking at word choice: "The hackles rose on his neck." "Hackles" is usually used for animals, like dogs. Humans don't have hackles, so maybe "the hairs on the back of his neck" would be more appropriate.

Now for coherence. The story is a bit complex with time dimensions and matter transmission. The transition from Ramsey tackling Margot to Garr Symm jumping into the black box is a bit abrupt. The reader might need more context on why Garr Symm is doing that. Also, the explanation from Vardin about the equation and their ancestors is a bit dense. The flow from the action to the exposition is a bit sudden, which might make it harder to follow.

The ending where Vardin flickers and disappears, and then Ramsey and Margot leave, might be confusing. The transition from the intense dialogue to the sudden ending feels abrupt. There's a lack of resolution for some plot points, like what exactly happens to Garr Symm after he enters the box. The reader might be left wondering about the consequences.

There's also a shift in tense or perspective in some parts. For example, "She looked at Ramar Chind and Chind, responding, went to Garr Symm..." The mention of "Ramar Chind and Chind" is confusing. It might be a typo or a name repetition. Also, the transition from the action to the dialogue about equations and doom is a bit jarring, making the coherence suffer.

Overall, there are a few grammatical issues, awkward phrasings, and some coherence problems where the narrative could be clearer. The story is complex, so some confusion is expected, but the abrupt transitions and unclear explanations might affect the overall flow.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward sentence structure in "The man of Irwadi fell, his helmet cracked, he tried to scream--and died" (run-on without conjunction).  
- [LEXICON] Inappropriate word choice: "hackles rose on his neck" (hackles are not human anatomy).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "You'll be good for each other, Ramsey, you and the girl" (word order disrupts clarity).  
- [SPELLING] Possible typo: "I am not a Vegan girl" (capitalization inconsistency or incorrect term).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift in narrative focus: Transition from Ramsey tackling Margot to Garr Symm’s actions lacks clear motivation.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden exposition: Vardin’s explanation about "the equation" and ancestors disrupts the action without smooth setup.  
- [CLARITY] Confusing name repetition: "She looked at Ramar Chind and Chind, responding..." (redundant phrasing).  
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear resolution: Garr Symm’s transformation into a caveman ancestor is introduced abruptly without prior foreshadowing.
