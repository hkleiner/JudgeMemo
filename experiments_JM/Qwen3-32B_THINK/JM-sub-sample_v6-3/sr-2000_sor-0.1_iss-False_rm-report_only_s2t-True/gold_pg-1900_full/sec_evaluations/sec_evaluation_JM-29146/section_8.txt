Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Analysis

Looking at the text for grammatical, syntactic, and lexical issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "And let down his mental guard." - This sentence is incomplete and lacks a subject.
- [GRAMMAR] "He tried to stand up and make his way back to the controls again, but collapsed and went down to his knees." - Awkward phrasing with "went down to his knees."
- [SPELLING] "m.g. gun" - This abbreviation is not standard and is unclear without explanation.
- [SYNTAX] "He tried to stand up and make his way back to the controls again, but collapsed and went down to his knees." - The sentence is grammatically correct but awkwardly worded.
- [SYNTAX] "She got up with it, backing away from him quickly toward the rear bulkhead as the ship seemed to go into a smooth glide which could be felt within it." - Awkward phrasing with "which could be felt within it."
- [SYNTAX] "Vardin stood alongside Ramsey, a hand to her mouth in horror." - Slightly awkward phrasing.
- [SYNTAX] "But if I went out there I'd perish from cold in seconds and lack of air in minutes." - Missing article before "lack of air."
- [SYNTAX] "Ramsey smiled without humor. 'What now, little lady?' he said mockingly." - The transition between paragraphs is abrupt.
- [SPELLING] "m.g. gun" appears repeatedly without explanation.
- [LEXICON] "m.g. gun" - The meaning is unclear without context or explanation.
- [SYNTAX] "You could go out there perfectly protected from the lethal environment by the absence of the time dimension." - Awkward phrasing.

Overall, there are several minor grammatical and syntactic issues, but they don't severely impact readability.

## Coherence Analysis

Looking at the logical flow and structure of the text:

- [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different characters and perspectives without clear transitions.
- [LOGIC] The concept of "hyper-space" and the physics involved is complex and somewhat confusing.
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift from Ramsey being dazed to being seated at the controls is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The transition from Ramsey being injured to suddenly being able to sit at the controls is not well explained.
- [LOGIC] The concept of time not existing in hyper-space and how that affects weapons and the environment is not clearly explained.
- [LOGIC] The transition from the Enterprise landing to the external description of hyper-space is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The sudden appearance of "Garr Symm" and "Ramar Chind" without introduction is jarring.
- [LOGIC] The shift in perspective from Ramsey to Garr Symm is abrupt and not well signaled.
- [LOGIC] The internal monologue of Garr Symm about "proto-man" and inherited fear is confusing and not well connected to the main narrative.
- [LOGIC] The transition back to Ramsey and Margot is abrupt without clear indication.
- [LOGIC] The concept of teleportation and its implications is introduced suddenly without buildup.
- [LOGIC] The shift from Ramsey's thoughts to the external description of the environment is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The transition from Ramsey's thoughts to the dialogue with Margot is abrupt.

The text has some coherence but contains several logical jumps and unclear transitions between different elements of the narrative.

## Final Scores

Based on the fluency analysis, I would rate the fluency as a 3.5. There are several minor grammatical and syntactic issues, but the text is generally readable.

Based on the coherence analysis, I would rate the coherence as a 2.5. There are significant logical jumps and unclear transitions between different parts of the narrative, making it difficult to follow at times.

Let me revise my evaluation to ensure it's accurate:

Fluency: The text has some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but it's generally readable. I'll rate it as a 3.5.

Coherence: The text has several logical jumps and unclear transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative at times. I'll rate it as a 2.5.

Let me now format this in the required format:
