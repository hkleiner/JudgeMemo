Okay, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The task is to rate fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. 

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice some instances where words might be misspelled or awkwardly phrased. For example, "coughed wrackingly" – "wrackingly" seems like a made-up adverb. Maybe it should be "wrackingly"? Also, "I'll knock your block off" is a common phrase, but in the context, it's a bit informal and might be a dialect or slang that's not standard. There's "hyper-one and hyper-two" which could be hyphenated differently, like "Hyper One and Hyper Two" if they're proper names. The sentence "He watched the gambling for another hour or so without risking his few remaining credits." – the structure here is okay, but maybe "He watched the gambling for another hour or so without risking his few remaining credits." is a bit wordy. Also, "He had only three credits left." – the placement of "only" might be better as "He had only three credits left." which it is, so that's fine. Another point: "He was in a rough spot and he knew it." – "rough spot" is a common phrase, but maybe "He was in a rough spot, and he knew it." with a comma for clarity. There are a few instances of missing commas, like after introductory phrases. Also, "You outworlderth have been deprething the thandard of living..." – the 'th's here are phonetic spelling, which is intentional for the Irwadian's speech, so that's not a mistake. So the main fluency issues are the made-up adverb and possible punctuation issues.

Now for coherence. The text is a continuation of a story where Ramsey is helping Englander and then goes to gamble. The transition from the domestic scene to the gambling hall is smooth. However, when introducing Garr Symm, there's a sudden shift in the narrative to the Irwadian's perspective and his role in the Security Police. The introduction of Garr Symm as a new character might be a bit abrupt, but since the context is a longer story, maybe some background is missing. The Vegan girl's appearance and her warning about Garr Symm adds a new plot point. The flow is mostly logical, but there's a slight jump when Ramsey is told about Garr Symm's position. The connection between the gambling scene and the political context of planetarization is clear. The ending with the confrontation and the explanation about Earth's role ties it back to the themes introduced earlier. However, the sudden mention of the Vegan girl and her knowledge of Garr Symm might feel a bit disconnected if the reader isn't familiar with the previous context. Also, the explanation about Irwadian scales and clothing could be a bit out of place in the middle of the gambling scene, but it's a necessary exposition for world-building. So coherence is mostly maintained, but there are a couple of points where the narrative could be more smoothly connected.

Considering the fluency issues, there are a few minor errors, but the text is mostly readable. The main problems are the adverb and possible punctuation. For coherence, the story flows well, but there are a couple of abrupt transitions and exposition points. Based on the scales, fluency might be a 4.5 because the errors are minor and don't disrupt reading. Coherence is a 4, as the story is mostly coherent but has a couple of noticeable transitions.
