Okay, let's start evaluating this text. First, I need to check for fluency and coherence issues.

For fluency, I'll look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me read through the current section again.

The text is quite long, but I notice some parts where the phrasing is a bit awkward. For example, "The rest was domiciled at her country place at Chevilly..." The word "domiciled" here is a bit formal and maybe not the best choice, but it's not incorrect. Then there's "She had now become celebrated, and the patrons of art fought among themselves for her productions." The transition here is smooth, but "productions" might be better as "works" for clarity. 

Looking at sentences like "Her reputation had overleaped frontiers; she was as celebrated abroad as she was in France." The semicolon is correctly used. However, in "The city of Ghent, to which she had loaned the Horse Fair for its exposition, demonstrated its gratitude..." the phrasing is a bit long but still understandable. 

There's a part where it says "Also, in depicting him as associated with the toil of animals, she shows him to us only under a useful and noble aspect..." The word "Also" might be better placed at the beginning of the sentence for clarity. 

In the quote from Anatole de la Forge, the sentence structure is complex but correct. The use of quotation marks and commas seems correct. However, in "They are Messieurs Brascassat, Coignard, Palizzi, and Troyon, and more especially a woman, Mlle. Rosa Bonheur..." the transition from "Messieurs" to "a woman" is a bit jarring but not a major issue. 

Overall, there are some minor issues with word choice and sentence structure, but nothing that really disrupts the flow. So maybe a 4 for fluency.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative about Rosa Bonheur's career and achievements. The structure is logical, moving from her studio to her menagerie, then to her exhibitions and recognition. However, there are some transitions that could be smoother. For example, the shift from her studio in Paris to her country place at Chevilly is a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of her travels to Scotland and the subsequent acquisition of animals isn't clearly connected to the previous part about her menagerie. 

Another point is the transition from the anecdote about the Empress to the conclusion of the section. It feels a bit disconnected. The text also jumps between different time periods and events without clear transitions, which might confuse some readers. However, overall the narrative is coherent with a clear progression. So maybe a 4 for coherence as well.
