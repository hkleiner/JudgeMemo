Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or issues with syntax.

The text is written in a formal, narrative style, which is generally fluent. However, there are a few instances where the phrasing seems a bit old-fashioned or awkward. For example, "The fairies who presided at his birth omitted to endow him with riches" uses a metaphor that might be considered a bit archaic, but it's not necessarily a fluency issue. 

Looking at sentence structure, most sentences are well-constructed. However, there are a few places where the sentences are a bit long or complex, which might affect readability. For example, "The Bonheurs had, at this time, formed a close friendship with a family by the name of Silvela, but the latter left Bordeaux in 1828 in order to assume the direction of an institute for boys in Paris." This sentence is quite long and could be split for better clarity, but it's still understandable.

Spelling and punctuation seem correct throughout the text. There are no obvious typos or misspellings. The use of commas and periods is appropriate, and the sentences flow smoothly for the most part.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence refers to how well the ideas are connected and how logically the text progresses. The text tells a chronological story of Rosa Bonheur's early life, so it's generally coherent. However, there are a few places where the transitions between ideas or events could be smoother. For example, the transition from the family moving to Paris to Rosa being placed in a boys' school is abrupt. There's no clear explanation of why this decision was made, which might confuse the reader.

Another point is the mention of the 1830 revolution and how it affected the family. The text moves quickly from the revolution to the cholera outbreak in 1832 without explaining the connection or the impact of the revolution on their lives. This could create a slight jump in the narrative.

There are also some instances where the text references events or people without sufficient context. For example, "Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the great naturalist, entrusted him with the execution of a large number of plates for a natural history." The reader might not know who Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire is or the significance of the plates, but since this is a biographical text, it's possible that the target audience would be familiar with these references.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, with a clear progression of events. However, there are a few instances where the transitions could be smoother and where more context would help the reader follow the narrative.

For the fluency score, I would rate it a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues in phrasing and sentence structure that don't significantly affect readability. 

For the coherence score, I would also rate it a 4.5. The narrative is logical and well-structured, but there are a few instances where the transitions could be smoother and where more context would help the reader follow the story.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., long, multi-clause sentences). - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("bespattered the white walls," "assumed the direction"). - [PUNCTUATION] Occasional comma splices in descriptive passages.  
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between events (e.g., moving from the 1830 revolution to the cholera outbreak without contextual linkage). - [CLARITY] Sudden shifts in focus (e.g., the Silvela familyâ€™s role in Paris is introduced but not fully contextualized). - [STRUCTURE] Minor inconsistencies in temporal sequencing (e.g., the timeline of family relocations is occasionally unclear).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
