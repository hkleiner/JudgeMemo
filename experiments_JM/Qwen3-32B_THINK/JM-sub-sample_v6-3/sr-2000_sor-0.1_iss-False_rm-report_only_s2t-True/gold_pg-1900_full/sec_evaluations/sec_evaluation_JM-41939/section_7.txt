Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a text about Rosa Bonheur's later life and death, and I need to assess it for fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. I'll read through the text carefully. The first sentence is "Rosa Bonheur was seventy-seven years of age..." That seems okay. "Robust health" is a bit old-fashioned but acceptable. "Her talent still retained its unvarying power and her hand was still firm." The structure here is a bit repetitive with "her" and "still," but it's not a major issue. 

Looking for grammar or spelling errors. The sentence "which had the appearance of having been painted in the flood-tide of youth." "Flood-tide" is a valid metaphor, though a bit archaic. The phrasing is a bit wordy but not incorrect. 

Next, "contrary to her habit, she sent to the Salon." The phrase "contrary to her habit" is correct. "They even talked of awarding her the medal of honour..." "Honour" is British spelling, but since the text seems to be in British English, that's consistent. 

In the second paragraph: "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity." "Concert of regrets" is a metaphor, which is okay. "Without a dissenting note, without reserve, the entire press..." The repetition of "without" is a stylistic choice but not a grammatical error. 

"According to her desire, she was interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise..." "Père-Lachaise" is correctly spelled. "The cortège which followed her coffin was made up of every eminent figure..." "Cortège" is correct, but the sentence is a bit long. 

"Strangers came in throngs, especially from England." That's clear. "And this innumerable cortège that followed her bier testified..." "Innumerable" is a strong word, but appropriate. 

Now, checking for any issues. I don't see any obvious grammatical errors. The sentences are well-structured. The only possible issue is the use of "flood-tide" which is a bit archaic but not incorrect. Also, the sentence "The concert of regrets which greeted her death was touching in its unanimity." The phrase "concert of regrets" is a metaphor, but it's clear in context. 

Moving to coherence. The text flows logically from her age and health, to her work, the praise she received, her death, and the tribute after her death. Each paragraph transitions smoothly. The ideas are connected and there's no repetition. The mention of her interment and the cortège follows naturally from the previous information. The conclusion about her career and lack of enemies ties it all together. 

Possible coherence issues? The transition from her death to the tribute is smooth. The mention of the cortège and the strangers from England adds to the tribute section without being disjointed. The final sentence about her career is a good conclusion. 

No major issues in either fluency or coherence. The text is well-written with minimal issues. For fluency, maybe a 4.5 because of the slightly archaic language but no real errors. Coherence is strong, so a 5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic/old-fashioned phrasing ("flood-tide of youth," "concert of regrets," "cortège")  
- [SYNTAX] Slightly wordy phrasing ("which had the appearance of having been painted," "without a dissenting note, without reserve")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Slight abruptness in transition from her death to the tribute section (though contextually logical)  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "this innumerable cortège that followed her bier" (could imply the cortège itself testified, rather than the crowd's presence)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
