Okay, let's start evaluating this text for fluency and coherence. First, I'll go through the fluency issues. The text is quite long, so I need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or spelling mistakes. I notice a few places where the syntax is a bit off. For example, "He consorted with many other men who made some mark in the world of thought, and in this atmosphere the extraordinary receptivity of his mind must have served him to great advantage." The structure here is a bit convoluted. Also, there's a missing comma in "Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship of Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, he consorted..." which makes the sentence run-on. There are some instances of [SPELLING] errors, like "Shakspere's" instead of "Shakespeare's." 

Looking at coherence, the text is a detailed biography of Reynolds, moving through his career and personal life. The flow is generally logical, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after discussing his friendships and weaknesses, the text jumps into the establishment of the Royal Academy without a clear transition. Also, some paragraphs introduce new ideas without sufficient setup, which might confuse the reader. There's a part where the author discusses Reynolds' weaknesses and then shifts to his professional achievements without linking them well. 

For fluency, I'll note the grammatical and structural issues. For coherence, the main problems are the abrupt transitions and lack of clear connections between sections. Based on the scale, the fluency has some minor issues but is mostly readable, so maybe a 4. Coherence is mostly coherent but has some weak transitions, so maybe a 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He consorted with many other men who made some mark in the world of thought, and in this atmosphere the extraordinary receptivity of his mind must have served him to great advantage."  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing comma in "Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship of Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, he consorted..." (run-on sentence).  
- [SPELLING] "Shakspere's" instead of "Shakespeare's."  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of passive voice ("was compelled to drive," "was left to linger") reduces readability.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Reynolds’ personal weaknesses to the establishment of the Royal Academy without clear linkage.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing Reynolds’ artistic philosophy to his professional achievements, disrupting narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Weak connection between paragraphs on his friendships and the later section on the Royal Academy’s founding.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the living served him as well as the dead" lacks contextual clarity.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
