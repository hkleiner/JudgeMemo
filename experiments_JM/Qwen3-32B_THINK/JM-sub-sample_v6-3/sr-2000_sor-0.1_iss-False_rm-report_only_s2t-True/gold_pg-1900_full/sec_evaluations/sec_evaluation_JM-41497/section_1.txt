Alright, I'll evaluate the provided text segment for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria and scales.

Looking at FLUENCY first:

The text is written in formal, literary style with complex sentence structures. I'll check for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, word choice issues, and punctuation problems.

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "He is said to have remarked when quite a lad" - this is grammatically correct but slightly awkward in phrasing.
- [SYNTAX] "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." - This is a very long sentence with complex syntax that could be clearer.
- [SYNTAX] "Had there been no Reynolds there might have been no Royal Academy--the Institution in its earliest days was indebted very deeply to him." - The structure is complex and slightly confusing.
- [LEXICON] "He was a clever young man determined to make a name." - The phrase "make a name" is a common idiom but might be considered slightly informal in this context.
- [PUNCTUATION] "Sir Walter Armstrong thinks that one of his copies of a Rembrandt is classed among the originals in the National Gallery to-day!" - The exclamation mark at the end is somewhat unexpected and might be inappropriate for the formal tone.

Now for COHERENCE:

The text is a biographical essay about Joshua Reynolds. I'll check for logical progression, clear transitions between ideas, and overall organization.

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Reynolds' life and career without always clear transitions. For example, it moves from his early life to his Italian journey to his later career without clear markers.
- [LOGIC] Some statements are made without sufficient context or explanation. For instance, the claim that Reynolds "turned the dross of Reynolds' art to fine gold" is somewhat cryptic without more context.
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses complex or ambiguous phrasing that could be clearer. For example, "Art will not yield to inspiration alone" is a vague statement that could use more explanation.
- [TRANSITION] Some paragraphs begin without clear connection to the previous ones. For example, the paragraph beginning with "The years between 1749 and 1752..." follows a paragraph about Reynolds' early career but doesn't clearly establish the connection.

Based on these observations:

For FLUENCY: The text is generally well-written with complex but mostly correct sentence structures. There are some awkward phrasings and a few instances where the complex syntax could be clearer. However, these issues don't significantly interfere with comprehension. I would rate this as a 4.

For COHERENCE: The text is organized as a biographical essay with a logical progression through Reynolds' life and career. However, there are some places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother and where the logic of some statements could be clearer. The overall structure is sound but not perfect. I would rate this as a 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Very long and complex sentences with nested clauses that may hinder readability
- [GRAMMAR] Minor issues with subject-verb agreement in some complex constructions
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em dashes without consistent pattern
- [LEXICON] Some archaic or formal expressions may feel outdated to modern readers

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between different aspects of Reynolds' life without clear transitions
- [LOGIC] Some cause-effect relationships are stated without sufficient explanation
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "the Institution" without explicit identification
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between Reynolds' personal life and professional achievements

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
