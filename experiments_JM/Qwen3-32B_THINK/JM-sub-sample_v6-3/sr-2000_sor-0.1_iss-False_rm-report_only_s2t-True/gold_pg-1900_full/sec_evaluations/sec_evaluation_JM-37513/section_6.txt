Alright, I need to evaluate this text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The text is quite dense with technical terms and complex sentences. I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice.

First, I notice some run-on sentences. For example, "Preserving the spirit of Spencer's teaching we must regard all modes..." – the lack of a comma after "teaching" makes it a bit hard to read. That's a syntax issue. Also, there are instances where the structure is a bit convoluted, like "Denoting them by the letters A, B, C we find that there are progressively ascending modes..." The placement of "Denoting them" at the beginning without a comma is a syntax problem. 

Looking for grammar issues, I see "We give HO as the formula..." – "HO" should be "H2O". That's a spelling mistake. There's also "physico-chemical" which is hyphenated correctly, but the term is complex and might be a point of confusion for some readers. 

In terms of phrasing, there are some awkward constructions. For example, "This is no new doctrine, though it has received of late a new emphasis." The phrase "has received of late" is a bit old-fashioned and could be smoother. Also, "There are, he says in substance, some cases..." uses "in substance" which might be a bit confusing. 

Now moving to coherence. The text is discussing complex philosophical and scientific concepts, so the flow of ideas is crucial. The author transitions between different types of relatedness (A, B, C) and their implications. However, some transitions are abrupt. For example, after discussing the physico-chemical type, the text jumps to vital and cognitive types without clear links. That's a transition issue. 

There's also some repetition, like the mention of Spencer's views multiple times without clear progression. The text references previous authors and their ideas, but sometimes the connections are not well-explained. For instance, when discussing Mill and Lewes, the relevance to the main argument isn't clearly established. That could be a logic or clarity problem. 

The structure is mostly logical, but there are parts where the argument seems to meander. For example, the discussion about HO (H2O) and constitutive properties is a good example of a specific point, but it's not clearly connected back to the broader argument about relatedness. That's a structure issue. 

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with syntax and word choice, but the text is mostly readable. Coherence is affected by abrupt transitions and some unclear connections between ideas. The author does a good job of presenting complex ideas but could improve the flow and clarity between sections.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentences and missing commas in complex constructions (e.g., "Preserving the spirit of Spencer's teaching we must regard all modes...").  
- [SPELLING] "HO" instead of "H2O".  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or abstract phrasing (e.g., "has received of late a new emphasis").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward placement of dependent clauses (e.g., "Denoting them by the letters A, B, C we find that...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between discussion of A, B, C types of relatedness without clear transitions.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of Spencer’s critique without resolving earlier questions (e.g., "But in the doctrine of implication they are just the laws of B and C...").  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous connections between empirical claims and philosophical arguments (e.g., HO example not clearly tied to broader thesis).  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jumps between authors (Mill, Lewes, Spencer) without contextualizing their relevance to the main argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
