Alright, let's start by reading the current section thoroughly to understand what I'm dealing with. The text is a philosophical discussion between Herbert Spencer and Henri Bergson, focusing on the concepts of the Unknowable, evolution, and the role of the intellect versus intuition. The language is dense, academic, and filled with complex ideas. 

First, I need to evaluate the fluency. Fluency issues would include grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. Let me scan through the text for any obvious errors. The text is written in a formal, academic style, which might have some complex sentence structures, but I don't notice any spelling mistakes. There are a few long sentences, but they are typical for philosophical writing. For example, "But some of us may find it hard to distinguish M. Bergson's 'original activity' from Spencer's Unknowable, which, so far as one can make out, somehow produced precisely the same results." This is a long sentence but grammatically correct. I don't see any major grammatical errors. However, there are instances where the phrasing is a bit awkward or could be clearer. For example, "It would take us too far from the line of Spencer's thought to consider M. Bergson's doctrine..." – the phrasing is a bit convoluted. 

Next, coherence. Coherence relates to how the ideas flow and connect. The text is a continuation of a previous discussion, so it's important to see if the current section maintains a logical progression. The author is comparing and contrasting Spencer and Bergson's views, which requires clear transitions. Let me check if the ideas are logically sequenced and if there are any abrupt shifts. The text does transition from discussing Spencer's Unknowable to Bergson's concept of Life, then back to Spencer's philosophy of science. The flow seems logical, but there are some parts where the connection between paragraphs could be tighter. For example, after discussing Bergson's critique, the author shifts to Spencer's treatment of cause and effect, which is a different topic. However, since the author is comparing their philosophies, this shift is somewhat expected. 

Looking for coherence issues, one possible problem is the use of references to previous sections (like "M. Bergson's doctrine that it is the intellect that portions the world...") without sufficient explanation in the current text. Since the user mentioned that the context segment is provided for context but not to be evaluated, I need to focus only on the current segment. However, some references might be unclear without the preceding context, but the user instructed to evaluate the current segment on its own. 

Another aspect is the use of terms like "noumenal Source," which is a philosophical term but might be unclear to a general reader. However, given the academic nature of the text, this is acceptable. 

Now, considering the fluency score. The text is mostly well-structured with minor awkward phrasings but no major errors. I would say it's mostly fluent, maybe a 4.5 or 4. For coherence, the text maintains a logical flow despite the complex subject matter, but there are a few transitions that could be smoother. I might rate it a 4 or 4.5. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any instances where the flow is disrupted? The sentence about "It would take us too far from the line of Spencer's thought to consider..." is a bit abrupt, but it's a common academic move to set boundaries. The discussion of Bergson's doctrine and then moving to Spencer's philosophy of science is a natural progression in the comparison. 

In terms of coherence, the author does a good job connecting the ideas, even if the content is dense. The use of phrases like "But some of us may find it hard to distinguish..." keeps the reader engaged and maintains the line of argument. 

So, final fluency score: 4.5 (mostly fluent with minor issues). Final coherence score: 4.5 (highly coherent with some minor transitions that could be smoother but not disruptive).

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "But some of us may find it hard to distinguish M. Bergson's 'original activity' from Spencer's Unknowable, which, so far as one can make out, somehow produced precisely the same results").  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of abstract terms ("noumenal Source," "transfigured realism") that may obscure clarity.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of semicolons and em-dashes in dense passages, risking reader fatigue.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between Spencer and Bergson’s concepts without explicit transitional markers.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references to "Source" and "evolution" in later paragraphs, potentially confusing the distinction between their philosophies.  
- [LOGIC] Minor inconsistency in the argument about "cause and effect" when juxtaposed with earlier sections on the Unknowable.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
