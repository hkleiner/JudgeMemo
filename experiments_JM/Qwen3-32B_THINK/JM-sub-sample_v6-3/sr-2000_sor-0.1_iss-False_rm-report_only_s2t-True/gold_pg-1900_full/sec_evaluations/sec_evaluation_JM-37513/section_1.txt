Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The passage is quite long and filled with complex sentences and academic vocabulary. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice issues.

First, I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, "I was a willing slave. And here in one glowing sentence the inner core of evolution lay revealed." The transition between these two sentences is abrupt. Also, there are some instances where the syntax is a bit convoluted, making it hard to follow. For instance, "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave." The structure here is confusing. 

Looking at punctuation, there are a few places where commas might be missing or misplaced. For example, "I dimly suspected that the old gentleman--old in the sense of being my father's contemporary--was ignorant..." The em dashes are used correctly here, but some other parts might need commas for clarity. 

Spelling seems okay, but I'll check for any typos. There's "animalcular" which might be a typo for "animalculous" or "animalcule," but it's possible it's a less common term. 

In terms of word choice, some phrases are a bit archaic or verbose, like "I was a willing slave." It's not incorrect, but it's a bit old-fashioned. However, considering the context and the author's style, it might be intentional. 

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a reflective piece discussing the author's early engagement with Spencer's philosophy. The main idea is how Spencer's theory of evolution through differentiation influenced the author. 

The structure is generally logical, but there are some abrupt shifts in ideas. For example, the transition from quoting Tyndall to discussing the friend's response is smooth, but later when moving from the friend's advice to the author's reading of Spencer's works, it feels a bit disconnected. 

There are some complex ideas presented without sufficient explanation, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject matter. For instance, the mention of "synthetic philosophy" and "biological relationships" might not be clear without context. 

The use of quotes and references to other works (like Sartor Resartus) adds depth but could be jarring if the reader isn't familiar. The flow between discussing different aspects of Spencer's work (biology, psychology, sociology) is logical, but the connections between these sections aren't always explicitly made, leading to some confusion. 

Overall, the text is coherent, but the complexity and density of ideas might make it challenging for some readers to follow without prior knowledge of the subject.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "I was a willing slave. And here in one glowing sentence..." (abrupt transition).  
- [SYNTAX] Convolution in "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy..." (unclear structure).  
- [LEXICON] Archaic/verbose diction (e.g., "I was a willing slave," "quicken that craving").  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in complex clauses (e.g., "I dimly suspected that the old gentleman--old in the sense...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from the friend’s critique to the author’s later engagement with Spencer’s works.  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense exposition of abstract concepts (e.g., "inter-related changes," "synthetic philosophy") without sufficient elaboration.  
- [TRANSITION] Jarring transitions between quoted passages (e.g., Tyndall, Spencer) and narrative reflection.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of "differentiation" and "homogeneous/heterogeneous" without resolving their interrelation.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
