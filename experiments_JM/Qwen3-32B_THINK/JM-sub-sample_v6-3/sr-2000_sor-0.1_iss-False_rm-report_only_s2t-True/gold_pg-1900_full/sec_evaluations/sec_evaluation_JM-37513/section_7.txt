Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. The text is quite dense and academic, so some complex sentences might be hard to parse. Let me look for any obvious errors. 

Looking at the first few sentences: "Otherwise, in each case, he confesses that 'we can learn nothing more than that here is one of the uniformities in the order of phenomena'." The structure here is a bit awkward. The phrase "in each case" might be redundant if it's part of the same context as the previous section. Maybe a [STRUCTURE] issue here. 

Next: "We may be able some day to establish an ordinal correlation..." The phrase "some day" is a bit informal in an academic context. Should it be "someday" as one word? That's a [SPELLING] issue. Also, "ordinal correlation" is a technical term; if it's correct, then it's okay, but if not, that's a [LEXICON] problem. 

Moving on: "It certainly is not yet attained. But I see no reason why we should not regard it as attainable." The repetition of "attainable" and "attained" might be okay for emphasis, but it could be a [REPEATED] issue. 

Then there's a quote from Spencer: "The properties of substances, though destroyed to sense by combination are not destroyed in reality." The placement of "though" is a bit off. It should be "though destroyed to sense by combination, are not destroyed..." which is a [GRAMMAR] error. 

Further down: "We here find a tardy recognition of the presence of specific vital characters." The phrase "tardy recognition" is correct, but maybe the sentence is a bit wordy. Not a major issue. 

In the next paragraph: "I speak of this as a tardy recognition; but it is one that does honour to the man; it is a frank admission..." The semicolons and structure here might be confusing. Could be a [SYNTAX] problem. 

Looking at the section on Spencer's view of consciousness: "So far well. Cognition is a very complex network of relatedness involving many terms." The phrase "So far well" is abrupt and might be better phrased as "So far, so good." That's a [CLARITY] issue. 

There's a sentence: "Hence Spencer defines life, psychical as well as physical, as 'the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations'." The use of "Hence" here is okay, but the sentence is a bit long. Maybe a [COMPLEXITY] issue. 

For coherence, the text is a detailed analysis of Spencer's philosophy, referencing previous works and contrasting different concepts. The flow is logical, but there are some transitions between ideas that could be smoother. 

The text jumps between discussing Spencer's early and later views, which is necessary but might cause abrupt shifts. The coherence here might be affected by the lack of clear transitions between these sections. That's a [TRANSITION] issue. 

There's a quote from Spencer that's followed by a discussion of his later work. The connection between the quote and the subsequent analysis is clear, but the shift from quoting to analysis could be smoother. 

The section on cognitive relatedness and the distinction between vivid and faint subjective affections is complex. The author introduces terms like "subjective affections" and equates them with states of consciousness, which might confuse readers if not clearly explained. This could be a [CLARITY] issue in coherence. 

The text also discusses the correlation of external and internal relations, then moves to behavior and cognition. The logical progression is there, but the dense terminology might make the coherence harder to follow. 

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with grammar, syntax, and word choice, but the text is mostly readable. For coherence, the logical flow is present, but transitions between complex ideas could be smoother. I'll need to assign scores based on the scales provided.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "though destroyed to sense by combination are not destroyed" (missing comma after "though")  
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentences (e.g., "It comprises relations in what is known, and relations in the organism as knowing")  
- [SPELLING] "someday" should be hyphenated if used as an adverb  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous terms like "subjective affections" without clear definitions  
- [STRUCTURE] Awkward phrasing in "So far well"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between quoting Spencer and analyzing his views  
- [CLARITY] Confusing terminology (e.g., equating "subjective affections" with "states of consciousness")  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas between cognitive processes and physiological correlations  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of concepts without clear progression  
- [TRANSITION] Unclear links between Spencer's earlier/later positions and emergent properties  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
