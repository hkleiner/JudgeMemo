Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "I was a willing slave. And here in one glowing sentence..." (abrupt transition).
        • Convolution in "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy..." (unclear structure).
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic/verbose diction (e.g., "I was a willing slave," "quicken that craving").

    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Repetition of "differentiation" and "homogeneous/heterogeneous" without resolving their interrelation.

  - Coherence: 4.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "But some of us may find it hard to distinguish M. Bergson's 'original activity' from Spencer's Unknowable, which, so far as one can make out, somehow produced precisely the same results").

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "Spencer tried to reduce all kinds of relatedness to one quasi-mechanical type; and he signally failed--or shall I say that he succeeded only by ignoring all the specific differences...").
        • Awkward phrasing in nested clauses (e.g., "the rate at which the rate of change itself changes").

  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and concrete examples (e.g., moving from Spencer’s terminology to numbered case studies without clear transitions).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
