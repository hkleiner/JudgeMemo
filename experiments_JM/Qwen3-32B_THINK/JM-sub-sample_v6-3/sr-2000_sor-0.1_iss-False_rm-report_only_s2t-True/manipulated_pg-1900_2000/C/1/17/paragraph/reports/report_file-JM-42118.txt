Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of archaic or overly complex phrasing ("attenuated ghosts," "wriggled southwards") that may confuse modern readers.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, convoluted sentences with multiple clauses (e.g., "he vowed his child to commerce and a thrifty life in this far-away country place that was but little vexed...") that risk disrupting readability.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Overuse of semicolons and em dashes in dense narrative sections, occasionally muddying clarity.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shifts between unrelated topics (e.g., Reynolds’ biography, French politics, Bahá’u’lláh’s writings) without clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Disjointed narrative flow: the text oscillates between Grasse’s gossip, Reynolds’ career, and Parisian political scandals, lacking cohesive progression.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous references (e.g., "our artist’s sixteenth year" initially unclear whether referring to Fragonard or Reynolds).
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt introduction of Rome chapter after a digression on the Pompadour’s influence, with no contextual linkage.

Section section_02 (Chars 7637–12637):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures with excessive subordination (e.g., "the year that saw the Pompadour come to supreme power (she had been for three years the king's acknowledged mistress)--the youth's mother...").
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Overuse of commas and em-dashes creating readability strain (e.g., "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honoré, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic phrasing ("So it came about--'twas in that year...") and inconsistent register ("large-hearted, generous, much-sinning" vs. "inferior designer, little favoured by fortune").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from Fragonard’s artistic training to unrelated political events ("quarrels between priests and parliaments" and Damiens' assassination) disrupts narrative focus.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Unclear transitions between chronological events (e.g., abrupt jump from Fragonard’s Prix de Rome to Boucher’s Louvre studio without connecting context).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Technical jargon about tapestry production ("enlargement," "Gobelins and Beauvais looms") lacks explanatory context for general readers.
