Let me analyze the provided text and evaluate it for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Analysis:**
I'll look for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

- [GRAMMAR] "They were written by devotees. And this age could not have produced them." - The transition between these two sentences is abrupt, and the second sentence lacks a clear connection to the first.
- [SYNTAX] "They would leave naught alone; and they scorned consequences." - The semicolon usage here is questionable, and the phrase "leave naught alone" is archaic and slightly awkward.
- [LEXICON] "Pictures of the Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite beauty of their naïveté, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not as artistic renderings of fact." - The phrase "exquisite beauty of their naïveté" is somewhat contradictory in meaning.
- [SYNTAX] "Having been compelled to abandon its belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles and ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in anything at all." - This is a complex sentence with multiple clauses that could be clearer.
- [LEXICON] "Sentimentality is held in such horror that people are afraid even of sentiment." - The contrast between "sentimentality" and "sentiment" is confusing without more context.
- [SYNTAX] "None were humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the field of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field of faith." - This sentence is complex and could be clearer.

**Coherence Analysis:**
I'll look for logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth transitions, clear progression, and overall structure.

- [LOGIC] The text jumps from discussing Christmas to Bahá’u’lláh's writings without a clear transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The overall structure is somewhat disjointed, with the discussion of Christmas and then a shift to Bahá’u’lláh without clear connection.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from the discussion of Christmas and faith to Bahá’u’lláh's writings is abrupt.
- [LOGIC] The argument about Christmas and faith is somewhat meandering, with multiple points that could be better connected.
- [CLARITY] The final paragraph about Christmas spirit and people's instincts is somewhat vague and could be clearer.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

For fluency, the text is generally well-written with some complex sentences that could be clearer, but no major grammatical errors that severely impact understanding. I would rate it a 4.5 - it's mostly fluent with some minor issues in syntax and word choice that occasionally affect clarity.

For coherence, the text has a clear central theme about the changing perception of Christmas and the role of faith, but the shift to Bahá’u’lláh's writings is abrupt and not well connected to the rest of the text. The argument is generally coherent but has some logical jumps and could benefit from smoother transitions. I would rate it a 4 - mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.

1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Abrupt transition between "devotees" and "this age could not have produced them" - [LEXICON] "Leave naught alone" is archaic and slightly awkward - [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structure in the "Having been compelled" sentence could be clearer - [LEXICON] Confusing contrast between "sentimentality" and "sentiment" without context - [SYNTAX] Cumbersome phrasing in "None were humbler than the foremost scientists..."

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden shift to Bahá’u’lláh's writings without transition - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed structure between Christmas discussion and Bahá’u’lláh section - [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Christmas to Bahá’u’lláh's writings - [LOGIC] Meandering argument about Christmas and faith with multiple points - [CLARITY] Vague final paragraph about Christmas spirit and people's instincts
