Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to identify any issues.

First, for fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite long, so I'll scan for any obvious errors. The first paragraph seems okay, but I notice some awkward phrasing like "to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave." The structure here is a bit confusing. Maybe a comma splice or missing conjunction. Then there's a quote with "animalcular" which might be a typo for "animalculous" or "animalcule." The word "saeculum mirabile" is in Latin, which is fine in context, but I should check if it's correctly used. There's also "the reign of Queen Victoria... covered the latter half of this saeculum mirabile..." – the transition here is a bit abrupt. Later, there's a sentence about Reynolds and Hudson, which seems to mix tenses and might be confusing. For example, "Hudson gave his pupil Guercino's drawings to copy. Before the time of apprenticeship had expired Reynolds had quarrelled..." The shift from past to past perfect might not be necessary. Also, the mention of "the first Lord Edgcumbe" and "Commodore Keppel" without clear context could be confusing. The text jumps between different topics and time periods, which might affect fluency. There are some run-on sentences, like the one starting with "Thus we are led up to the statement..." which is quite long and could be split for clarity. The use of phrases like "the Bábí community" and references to specific historical figures without explanation might be jargon-heavy for some readers. Also, the sentence "Boucher, on the eve of manhood..." is a bit unclear in its connection to the previous context. Overall, there are some grammatical issues and awkward phrasings that could be improved.

Now for coherence. The text is a philosophical discussion about Spencer's philosophy of science, interweaving historical context, personal anecdotes, and references to various figures and events. The main challenge here is the structure. The text starts with the author's personal experience with Tyndall's work, then moves to the Industrial Revolution, French Revolution, and their impacts, then shifts to Reynolds' biography, and later to Spencer's philosophy and its reception. The transitions between these sections are abrupt. For example, after discussing Reynolds' life, the text jumps back to Spencer's ideas without a clear link. There's also a mention of Bahá’u’lláh and Boucher, which seems unrelated to the main topic of Spencer. The coherence is affected by these sudden shifts in subject matter. The text also references specific works and concepts (e.g., "First Principles," "Synthetic Philosophy") without sufficient explanation, making it hard for a reader unfamiliar with the context to follow. The logical flow is sometimes disrupted by these jumps, and the connections between ideas aren't always clear. Additionally, the text's structure is non-linear, moving back and forth between different time periods and topics, which can confuse the reader. The mention of "the Bábí community" and "Commodore Keppel" without context adds to the confusion. The overall narrative lacks a clear progression, making it difficult to follow the author's argument about Spencer's philosophy. The conclusion attempts to summarize Spencer's contributions but does so in a way that jumps between different aspects without a cohesive thread. The coherence issues are significant, with multiple abrupt shifts and unclear transitions.

For the fluency score, considering the minor grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and some run-on sentences, but the text is generally readable. I'd say a 4, as the issues are present but don't severely disrupt understanding.

For coherence, the text has noticeable abrupt shifts and disconnected ideas, making the flow harder to follow. The score would be around 3, as it's generally coherent but with several issues affecting the overall structure and progression.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave" (comma splice/misplaced conjunction).  
- [LEXICON] Uncommon term "animalcular" (likely typo for "animalcule" or "animalculous").  
- [GRAMMAR] Tense inconsistency in "Before the time of apprenticeship had expired Reynolds had quarrelled..." (unnecessary past perfect).  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence starting with "Thus we are led up to the statement..." (excessively long, lacks clarity).  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition in "the reign of Queen Victoria... covered the latter half of this saeculum mirabile..." (unclear connection).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Reynolds' biography to Bahá’u’lláh and Boucher without contextual linkage.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jumps between topics (e.g., Industrial Revolution to Reynolds' life to Spencer's philosophy).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to "the Bábí community" and "Commodore Keppel" without contextual explanation.  
- [STRUCTURE] Non-linear narrative mixing personal anecdotes, historical events, and philosophical analysis without clear progression.  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected segments discussing unrelated figures/events (e.g., French Revolution vs. Reynolds' apprenticeship).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
