  Fluency Issues:

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down the French at Blenheim..." (passive voice creates ambiguity)
        • "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people with whom he was brought into contact..." (awkward clause structure)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "The sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was nearing the end of his long lease of splendour." (jarring shift from metaphor to historical detail without transition)

        • Sudden shift from Victorian Age to Louis XIV and Admiral Rooke without contextual linkage.

        • Disjointed progression from materialist enterprise collapse to Dr. Johnson's anecdotes without bridging ideas.
