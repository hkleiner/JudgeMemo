Let me carefully analyze the evaluation report to determine appropriate final scores for fluency and coherence.

For fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.0 with issues in syntax, structure, lexicon, and punctuation.
- Section 02 has a score of 3.0 with issues in syntax, lexicon, spelling, grammar, and structure.

Across both sections, we see:
- Syntax issues appear in both sections
- Structural problems are noted in both sections
- Lexical problems are mentioned in both sections
- Section 02 has additional issues with spelling and grammar

Considering the scale for fluency:
- Score 4: Mostly fluent but with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues that interrupt flow
- Score 2: Frequent errors making comprehension difficult

Given that the first section is at 4.0 and the second at 3.0, and the overall text has multiple grammatical and structural issues that interrupt flow in several places, I would place the final fluency score at 3.0. The text is generally readable but has enough problems to significantly impact the flow.

For coherence:
- Section 01 has a score of 3.5 with issues in logic, structure, transition, and clarity.
- Section 02 has a score of 2.5 with issues in logic, transition, structure, and clarity.

Across both sections, we see:
- Logic issues in both sections
- Structural problems in both sections
- Transition problems in both sections
- Clarity issues in both sections

Considering the scale for coherence:
- Score 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments
- Score 2: Frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas making it difficult to follow

The second section has more severe coherence problems (2.5) than the first (3.5). Given the significant issues with logical progression, transitions, and structural coherence throughout the text, I would place the final coherence score at 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort.

Final scores:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5 
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
