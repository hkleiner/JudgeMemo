Let me analyze the evaluation report to determine the final fluency and coherence scores for the entire text.

For FLUENCY:
- Section 1 has a 4.5 score with some issues:
  - Lexicon: archaic terms and unclear metaphors
  - Syntax: complex structures, overuse of punctuation, and abrupt temporal shifts
- Section 2 has a 4.0 score with:
  - Grammar issues: incorrect subjunctive forms

Overall, the text shows mostly fluent writing with minor issues that don't significantly disrupt readability. There are some archaic language choices and occasional grammatical errors, but these don't appear to be pervasive or severely impact understanding. The fluency scores average around 4.25.

For COHERENCE:
- Section 1 has a 4.0 score with issues:
  - Structure: abrupt shifts between topics
  - Logic: disconnected transitions
  - Clarity: weak connections between sections
  - Transitions: sudden topic changes
- Section 2 has a 3.0 score with:
  - Structure: abrupt shifts
  - Logic: disconnected transitions
  - Clarity: unclear connections between content

The coherence issues are more significant. There are frequent abrupt shifts and disconnected transitions that affect the logical flow of the text. While the first section is mostly coherent with only minor issues, the second section shows more noticeable problems that impact the overall reading experience. The coherence scores average around 3.5.

Based on this analysis, I would rate:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
