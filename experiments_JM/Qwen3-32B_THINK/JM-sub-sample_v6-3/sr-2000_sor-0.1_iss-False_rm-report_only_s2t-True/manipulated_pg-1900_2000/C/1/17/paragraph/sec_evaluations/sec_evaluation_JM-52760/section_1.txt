Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Analysis:

I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues.

1. [GRAMMAR] "Let us spend five minutes in picturing to ourselves the English nation in a condition of stable equilibrium, as it was in the eighteenth century." - This sentence is awkwardly phrased and has a strange structure. A more natural phrasing would be "Let us imagine the English nation in a stable equilibrium, as it was in the eighteenth century."

2. [SPELLING] "Bahá’u’lláh" - This appears to be correctly spelled, but it's an unusual name that might be challenging for readers.

3. [SYNTAX] "His vision of humanity as one people and of the earth as a common homeland, dismissed out of hand by the world leaders to whom it was first enunciated over a hundred years ago, has today become the focus of human hope." - This sentence is quite long and complex. It could be clearer with a more direct structure.

4. [LEXICON] "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." - "Upper arm" is not a common term in this context and might be confusing. It seems to refer to the main or primary part of the movement.

5. [FLUENCY] "City Point, located at the junction of the James and Appomattox Rivers and soon to be the supply center for the attack on Petersburg, was captured on May 4, 1864." - This sentence is a bit long and could be clearer.

6. [FLUENCY] "Here Butler waited, while north of him the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia engaged in a series of bloody battles." - This sentence has a minor issue with parallel structure.

7. [PUNCTUATION] "The transportation vehicles of the 1860’s did not require the wide, straight highways of the present." - The apostrophe in "1860’s" is not correctly placed; it should be "1860s" since it's a plural, not a possessive.

Overall, the text is generally fluent with only a few issues that might slightly affect readability.

## Coherence Analysis:

I'll look at logical sequencing, transitions, clarity, and overall organization.

1. [COHERENCE] The text begins with a discussion about the English nation in the 18th century, which seems out of place in a military history text about the American Civil War. This could confuse readers and disrupt the flow.

2. [COHERENCE] The text then shifts to discussing Bahá’u’lláh and his vision, which is another unrelated topic. This transition is abrupt and confusing.

3. [COHERENCE] The text jumps from the general strategic situation to a detailed listing of battles and movements without clear transitions.

4. [COHERENCE] The chapter on "UNION STRATEGY 1864" begins with a completely different topic (Bahá’u’lláh) and then shifts back to military strategy, creating a jarring transition.

5. [COHERENCE] The text moves from one battle to another without clearly establishing how they relate to each other or to the overall narrative.

6. [COHERENCE] There are some abrupt shifts in perspective, such as from the general strategic situation to specific troop movements and back.

7. [COHERENCE] The text sometimes provides too much detail about specific battles without clearly explaining their significance in the larger context of the campaign.

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For Fluency: The text has a few minor issues with grammar, syntax, and phrasing, but overall it's quite readable. I would give it a score of 4.

For Coherence: The text has some coherence issues, particularly with the odd inclusion of the English nation and Bahá’u’lláh in a military history text. These elements don't seem to belong in this context and disrupt the flow of the narrative. The transitions between different parts of the text could also be smoother. I would give it a score of 3.5.
