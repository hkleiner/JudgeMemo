Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency of the text. The user wants me to identify any issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I'll scan through the current section. The text is a historical narrative, so I need to check for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "High up, amongst the Sea-Alps that stretch along the southern edge of France..." The word "amongst" is British English, but that's not an error. The sentence is a bit long but flows well. 

Next, "there was born to a glovemaker of the town, worthy mercer Fragonard, a boy-child..." The structure here is a bit archaic, using "there was born," which is correct but might be considered old-fashioned. However, since the text is historical, this might be intentional. 

In the sentence about the glovemaker's vow, the phrasing is complex: "he vowed his child to commerce and a thrifty life in this far-away country place that was but little vexed with the high ambitions of distant, fickle, laughing Paris..." This is a long sentence with multiple clauses. While it's grammatically correct, it might be a bit unwieldy, but that's part of the style. 

Moving to the part about the war and its effects: "One result of the war has not always been realised." The verb tense here is present perfect ("has not always been realised"), which is correct in British English. The sentence structure is a bit complex but acceptable. 

In the section about Reynolds: "In Minorca he had fallen from his horse and sustained injuries that had left his face scarred for all time." The use of "had fallen" and "had sustained" is correct. The sentence is clear. 

The sentence about the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle: "In this, our artist's sixteenth year, the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years." The use of "had been" is correct. 

Now, checking for any spelling errors. Words like "vogues," "millineries," "fopperies," "Chauvinism," "Jingoism," "Venus-pieces," etc., seem correctly spelled. 

Looking at the transition between paragraphs. The text jumps from discussing Reynolds to gossip in Grasse. This might be a coherence issue, but for fluency, it's about sentence-level flow. 

Are there any punctuation issues? The use of semicolons and commas seems appropriate. For example: "so that our country, during the early part of Victoria's reign, was more isolated..." The commas around the inserted clause are correctly placed. 

Word choice: "attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards..." The metaphor is a bit unusual, but the words are used correctly. 

I don't see any obvious grammatical errors. The text is mostly fluent with some complex sentences that are well-structured. There might be a few instances of awkward phrasing due to the archaic style, but they don't hinder understanding. 

For Coherence, the main issues would be how the ideas flow and connect. The text starts with the birth of Fragonard, then shifts to the impact of the war, Reynolds' life, and then back to gossip in Grasse. The transitions between these sections might be abrupt. 

The section about Bahá’u’lláh’s writings seems out of place here. It's inserted in the middle of discussing the Pompadour, which might confuse the reader. 

The paragraph on Rome starts abruptly after a long discussion of Paris and France's politics. The connection between the previous content and the news of the notary is a bit sudden. 

There's also a shift from discussing Reynolds to the Pompadour's influence on art, which might not be directly related to Fragonard's early life. 

The coherence issues are more about the structure and transitions between different topics rather than sentence-level problems. The text jumps between different events and people without smooth transitions, making the narrative feel disjointed at times.

So, for Fluency, I'll give a high score since the sentences are mostly correct and flow well, even if some are complex. For Coherence, there are noticeable jumps and some sections that don't connect smoothly, so a mid-range score.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of archaic or overly complex phrasing ("attenuated ghosts," "wriggled southwards") that may confuse modern readers.  
- [SYNTAX] Long, convoluted sentences with multiple clauses (e.g., "he vowed his child to commerce and a thrifty life in this far-away country place that was but little vexed...") that risk disrupting readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of semicolons and em dashes in dense narrative sections, occasionally muddying clarity.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between unrelated topics (e.g., Reynolds’ biography, French politics, Bahá’u’lláh’s writings) without clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed narrative flow: the text oscillates between Grasse’s gossip, Reynolds’ career, and Parisian political scandals, lacking cohesive progression.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous references (e.g., "our artist’s sixteenth year" initially unclear whether referring to Fragonard or Reynolds).  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt introduction of Rome chapter after a digression on the Pompadour’s influence, with no contextual linkage.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
