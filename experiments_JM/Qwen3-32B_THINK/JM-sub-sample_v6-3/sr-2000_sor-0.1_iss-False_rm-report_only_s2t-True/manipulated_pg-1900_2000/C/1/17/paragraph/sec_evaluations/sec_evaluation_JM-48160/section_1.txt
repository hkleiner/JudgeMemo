Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues. The text has several grammatical errors. For example, in the first paragraph, "France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater" uses a semicolon incorrectly. It should probably be a colon or a period. Then there's "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit..." which is missing an article before "sauve conduit"—should be "un sauf conduit". Also, "you can come and go almost as freely as before the war." The phrase "as freely as before the war" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

Next, in the sentence "For nearly three months now I have felt like an inverted snob trying to ingratiate myself with, or even to meet members, of that curious caste..." the comma placement is off, making the sentence run-on. There's also a missing comma after "members" which could help with readability. The word "intensive" is used instead of "introverted" or "insular," which seems incorrect in context.

Looking at coherence, the text jumps from the author's experiences in France to a completely different narrative about a painter in the 18th century. This abrupt shift from modern war zone experiences to historical anecdotes about Reynolds and Boucher is jarring and disrupts the flow. The mention of Teheran and Bahá’u’lláh's mission also seems out of place, not connecting logically with the preceding or following content. Additionally, the transition from discussing the author's attempts to get into the war zone to the painter's life and then to cemeteries in Barcy is abrupt and confusing without clear connections.

The text also has some inconsistencies. For instance, the author talks about visiting hospitals and getting permissions, but then suddenly shifts to a historical account of a painter's career, which doesn't relate to the main narrative about the war zone. The mention of the Bábí victims in Teheran is another unrelated segment that breaks the coherence. These disjointed sections make it hard to follow the main story and understand the overall purpose of the text.

In terms of structure, the lack of clear transitions between different topics (like the author's personal journey, historical anecdotes, and unrelated events in Teheran) makes the text feel fragmented. The reader is left confused about how these elements connect, if they do at all. The coherence issues are significant because they prevent the reader from following a logical progression of ideas or events.
