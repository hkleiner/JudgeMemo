Let me analyze the evaluation report and determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

For FLUENCY:
- Section 01: Score 4.0 with some syntax, structure, phrasing, and cohesion issues.
- Section 02: Score 3.0 with more significant issues in lexicon, syntax, and spelling.

The fluency issues in section 02 seem more problematic with non-standard superlative forms, awkward phrasing, and unconventional spelling. Section 01 had mostly minor issues that didn't significantly disrupt readability. Overall, the text has a mix of mostly fluent sections with some more problematic ones, so I would rate fluency around 3.5.

For COHERENCE:
- Section 01: Score 3.5 with issues in logic (disconnected "women folk" paragraph) and transitions.
- Section 02: Score 2.5 with more severe coherence problems including abrupt shifts between religious discourse and biographical details without transitional context or thematic linkage.

The coherence issues are more severe in section 02, with disconnected topics that lack any clear thematic linkage. The text jumps between theological analysis and unrelated painter biography without explanation. Section 01 had noticeable but not as severe issues. Given the overall pattern of coherence issues across both sections, I would rate coherence around 3.0.

Let me finalize my scores:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
