Let me analyze the evaluation report to determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency.

For Fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 3.5 with multiple grammar and phrasing issues (punctuation inconsistency, subject-verb agreement, awkward phrasing with nested clauses, etc.)
- Section 02 has a better score of 4.0 with fewer issues (only one spelling issue and some complex syntax)

The recurring issues in section 01 include:
- Grammar problems (punctuation, subject-verb agreement)
- Awkward phrasing and prepositional phrase placement
- Archaic spelling

Section 02 shows improvement with only one spelling issue but still has some complex syntax.

For Coherence:
- Section 01 has a lower score of 2.5 with significant problems (abrupt transitions, collection of historical notes without theme, disjointed narrative flow)
- Section 02 has a better score of 3.5 but still shows issues (abrupt shifts, sudden jumps, unclear relationships)

The recurring coherence issues include:
- Abrupt transitions between unrelated topics
- Disjointed narrative flow
- Disconnected sections with no clear context or connections
- Unclear relationships between different parts of the text

Now I'll determine the final scores based on these evaluations:

For Coherence:
Section 01 has significant problems that would make the text hard to follow (score 2.5), while section 02 shows improvement but still has noticeable issues (score 3.5). The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing in places, which according to the scale would indicate a score between 2 and 3. Given the severity of the issues in section 01 and the improvement in section 02, I would rate the overall coherence as 3.0.

For Fluency:
Section 01 has multiple grammatical and phrasing issues affecting readability (score 3.5), while section 02 shows improvement with fewer issues (score 4.0). The text contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow in section 01, but section 02 is mostly fluent with only minor issues. Given the improvement in section 02 and the fact that section 01 is still generally readable, I would rate the overall fluency as 3.75 (or 3.5 if rounding to half points).

However, considering the instructions allow for half-points only, I'll adjust my fluency score to 3.5.
