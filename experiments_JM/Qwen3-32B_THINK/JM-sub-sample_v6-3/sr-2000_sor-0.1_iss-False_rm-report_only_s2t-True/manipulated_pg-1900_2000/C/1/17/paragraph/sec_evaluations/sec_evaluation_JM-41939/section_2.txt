Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to read through the current section carefully. The user wants me to rate both fluency and coherence, so I'll go through each metric step by step.

Starting with Fluency. I'll look for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice issues. Let me scan the text. 

The first paragraph seems okay. "She wore an eccentric costume, consisting of a sort of dolman with military frogs." The term "military frogs" might be a bit unclear, but maybe it's a specific term for the costume's design. Not sure if that's a problem. 

Next part: "The students and copyists who regularly frequented the museum..." "Frequented" is correct here. "Jests and criticisms flung out by passing strangers in regard to her work" – "flung out" is a bit strong but acceptable. 

Moving on: "The hours which she did not consecrate to the Louvre..." "Consecrate" is a good word choice. "She had already grasped instinctively the truth formulated by Ingres..." That's correct. 

Then there's a part about "Later on, when she in her turn became a teacher..." Maybe "in her turn" could be "as a teacher" for clarity, but it's not a major issue. 

The sentence about "the very scaffolding of all her works" – "scaffolding" is metaphorical, which is fine. 

In the next paragraph: "her father's mania for changing his residence dragged her successively to the Rue du Roule..." "Dragged her successively" – "dragged" is a strong verb, but maybe "dragged her successively" is a bit awkward. Maybe "dragged her successively to" is okay. 

The part about the Rue Rumford being "practically in the open country" – "practically" is correct. 

Then there's a shift to "In the years which immediately followed His departure from Persia, Bahá’u’lláh gave priority..." Wait, this seems out of place. The text is about Rosa Bonheur, but here it's talking about Bahá’u’lláh. That's a coherence issue, but maybe it's a typo or error in the text. However, the user said to evaluate the current section on its own terms, so maybe it's part of the text. But this seems like a major inconsistency. 

Continuing: "The sand being flung upon the wet ink..." This part is confusing. It seems to describe a scene with a priest and party, but it's unclear how this connects to Rosa Bonheur. This might be a coherence issue, but also a fluency issue if the sentences are awkward. 

Then the text returns to Rosa: "From this time forward, she sent pictures to the Salon annually." That's a smooth transition. 

The rest of the paragraphs about her works and the 1842 exhibitions are well-written. 

Now, for Fluency issues, I need to note any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, etc. The part about Bahá’u’lláh and the priest/party scene is problematic. Also, the sentence about "the sand being flung upon the wet ink" is confusing and might be a syntax issue. 

For Coherence, the main issue is the sudden shift to Bahá’u’lláh and the unrelated paragraph about the priest and party. This breaks the logical flow of the narrative about Rosa Bonheur. There might also be abrupt transitions between different parts of her life without clear connections. 

Let me check again. The paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh and the priest scene seems completely unrelated to Rosa's story. That's a major coherence problem. Also, the transition from her animal studies to the Bahá’u’lláh section is jarring. 

In terms of fluency, the sentence about the priest and party is awkwardly structured. For example, "the sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done, there was exchange of compliments..." This is confusing and lacks clarity. 

Another fluency issue could be the use of "flung out by passing strangers" – "flung out" might be a bit dramatic but is acceptable. 

Overall, the main fluency issues are in the confusing and awkwardly written part about the priest and party. The coherence issues are the sudden, unrelated paragraphs and the abrupt transitions. 

For scoring: 

Fluency: The main issues are in the problematic paragraph. The rest is mostly fluent. So maybe a 4? But the problematic part is significant. If that part is considered a major issue, maybe a 3.5? Because the rest is okay, but that one part is confusing and affects fluency.

Coherence: The sudden shift to Bahá’u’lláh and the unrelated scene is a major issue. It breaks the narrative flow. So maybe a 3 or 3.5. The rest of the text is coherent, but that part is a big problem.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Confusing and disjointed phrasing in the paragraph about "The sand being flung upon the wet ink..." and the priest/party scene.  
- [LOGIC] Awkward transition from Rosa Bonheur's animal studies to the unrelated reference to Bahá’u’lláh and Persian history.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden, unexplained shift to discussing Bahá’u’lláh and a priest/party scene, which is entirely unrelated to Rosa Bonheur's narrative.  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between Rosa’s artistic development and the disjointed historical/political paragraph, disrupting narrative flow.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
