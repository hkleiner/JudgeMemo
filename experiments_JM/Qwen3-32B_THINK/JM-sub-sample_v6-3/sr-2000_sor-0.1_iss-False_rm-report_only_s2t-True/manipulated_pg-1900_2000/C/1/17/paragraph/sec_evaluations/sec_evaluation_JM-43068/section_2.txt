Okay, let's start evaluating the current section for fluency and coherence. 

First, for Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. 

Looking at the first paragraph about Bahá’u’lláh's writings: "has made selections from Bahá’u’lláh’s writings accessible to people everywhere, in over eight hundred languages." The preposition "in" here seems a bit off. Maybe it should be "in over eight hundred languages" is correct, but the flow is a bit abrupt. Not a major issue.

Next, the Dr. Johnson paragraph. "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company, even though we may think..." The use of "could only have been" is a bit awkward. Also, "the benefit of the inspiration was not without serious drawbacks" is a complex sentence that might be confusing. 

Then, "Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship..." The placement of "also" here is a bit off. It should probably be "also enjoyed." 

In the sentence about "the extraordinary receptivity of his mind must have served him to great advantage," "served him to" is a bit awkward. Maybe "served him in a great advantage" would be better, but that's a correction, which I shouldn't do. The original phrasing is just a bit clunky.

Moving on to the next paragraph about Johnson's weaknesses: "He had human weaknesses to live down, and it is to his credit that he conquered all or most of them." The phrase "live down" is a bit old-fashioned and might be confusing. 

The part about "there was a touch of the snob about him--witness his correspondence..." The em dash here is okay, but the sentence structure is a bit long and could be clearer. 

In "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation..." "pettish condemnation" is a bit of an odd phrase. Maybe "petty condemnation" would be better, but again, I can't correct it. The word choice here is a bit off. 

The sentence about "the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought..." The structure is okay, but the description is a bit wordy. 

In the part about the sister Frances: "the coach in which his unfortunate sister Frances was compelled to drive..." The phrasing "was compelled to drive" is a bit awkward. Maybe "had to drive" would be smoother. 

The mention of "a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary..." The use of "prime minister's salary" is a bit confusing. Is it "prime minister's" or "prime minister's salary"? The possessive might be better as "a prime minister's salary." 

In the paragraph about the painting "La Baigneuse": "he endeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life." The phrase "draw himself into" is a bit awkward. Maybe "he endeavours to depict the brighter side of life" would be clearer. 

The description of the scene in the wood: "a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs placidly between the moss-covered banks." The use of "which" here is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and could be split for clarity. 

In the part about Diaz: "Here is a theme which would appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz..." The sentence structure is okay, but "a man of the temperament of Diaz" is a bit awkward. 

The comparison between Millet and Diaz: "But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad composition..." The contrast is clear, but the transition could be smoother. 

The sentence about Millet being "more a philosopher than a painter" is straightforward. 

In the paragraph about Millet's works: "Not only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very numerous..." The phrase "by the way" is a bit out of place here. It's more of an aside, which might disrupt the flow. 

The part about "the smallest duty which would have left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject..." The structure is a bit convoluted. The use of "has been made" is passive and might be clearer in active voice. 

In the description of "The Sheep Pen": "The sun, sinking low in the horizon..." The phrase "in the horizon" is incorrect; it should be "on the horizon." 

The description of the shepherd: "He is dead to the beauties of the landscape around him..." The phrase "dead to" is a bit strong and might be confusing. Maybe "unaware of" would be better, but again, I can't correct it. 

Overall, there are several instances of awkward phrasing, some word choice issues, and a few grammatical errors. These issues don't make the text hard to understand but do affect the smoothness of reading. So for Fluency, the score might be a 4, as it's mostly fluent with minor issues.

Now for Coherence. The text moves from discussing Bahá’u’lláh's translations to Dr. Johnson, then Reynolds, and then to Millet's paintings. The transition between these topics is abrupt. The context is about art appreciation, but the Dr. Johnson section seems out of place unless there's a connection I'm missing. 

The paragraph about the painting "La Baigneuse" is well-structured, but the shift from discussing Johnson to Millet is jarring. The text seems to jump between different artists and topics without clear transitions. 

The description of Millet's works is coherent within itself, but the overall structure of the current section is fragmented. The topics are related to art and artists, but the flow between different artists and their characteristics is not smooth. 

The final paragraph about "The Sheep Pen" is detailed and coherent on its own, but the overall section lacks a clear progression from one idea to the next. The reader might be confused about how the different parts connect. 

Given these issues, the Coherence score would be lower. The text has several abrupt shifts and lacks smooth transitions between different topics. So the Coherence score might be a 3.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
