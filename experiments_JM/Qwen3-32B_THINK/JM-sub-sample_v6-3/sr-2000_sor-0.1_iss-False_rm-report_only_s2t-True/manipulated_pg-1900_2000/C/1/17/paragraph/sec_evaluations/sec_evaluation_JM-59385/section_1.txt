Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The user wants me to look for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll go through the text sentence by sentence.

First sentence: "From the women of China I have learned that World Fellowship is not alone an intellectual concept but a natural law in accordance with which the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic beat of the Universe." The phrase "not alone an intellectual concept" might be better phrased as "not merely an intellectual concept." Also, "throb to the same rhythmic beat" is a bit awkward, maybe "throb in unison with the same rhythmic beat of the Universe" would be smoother.

Next, "To the women of America I dedicate this story of the life of my Chinese friend and teacher: it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it." The colon here is okay, but the sentence structure is a bit long and could be clearer. The phrase "small store of English words" is a bit old-fashioned, maybe "limited English vocabulary" is more modern. Also, "could make it" is a bit vague.

Then, "Turning off from the Da Mou Lui or the Big Horse Street, the name common to the main street in Chinese towns and villages..." The phrase "Turning off from" is a bit awkward. Maybe "Turning off onto the Da Mou Lui, also known as the Big Horse Street..." would be better. Also, "the name common to the main street" is a bit unclear. Maybe "the name commonly used for the main street."

The sentence "But I have found, for I like to visit the little shops on side streets, that the more precious jewels glow with a warmer brilliancy when the day outside is dark." The phrase "for I like to visit" is a bit informal and could be rephrased for better flow. Also, "warmer brilliancy" is a bit redundant; maybe "warmer glow" would be better.

In the paragraph about Yen Kuei Ping, the sentence "She was third in the procession. Madame Yen rode first, directly behind the house servant who walked ahead, breaking a way through the crowded Big Horse Street and into the quieter Street of Precious Pearls, crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" The phrase "breaking a way through" is a bit awkward. Maybe "breaking a path through." Also, "crying, 'Lend light, lend light.'" The use of "lend light" is a bit unclear. It might be a translation issue or a specific term, but it's not standard English.

The sentence "Following the swaying tapestried box-like chairs that marked the presence of her mother and grandmother, Kuei Ping leaned forward in her seat, peering through the horizontal aperture in front of her with brightening eyes." The phrase "tapestried box-like chairs" is a bit awkward. Maybe "tapestry-covered, box-like chairs." Also, "horizontal aperture" is correct, but maybe "a horizontal opening" is clearer.

In the description of the shop, the sentence "At the sound of their approach, two attendants of the door stepped forward and swung it wide, that the chair-bearers might carry the ladies into a tiny inner courtyard before they need dismount, saying as they bowed, 'Honorable ladies, enter the humble shop.'" The phrase "before they need dismount" is awkward. Maybe "before they needed to dismount." Also, the use of "that" instead of "so that" might be an issue.

The sentence "The eldest among them with his own hand took from an attendant each cup of tea as it was brought and offered it with a low bow to his guest." The phrase "with his own hand" is a bit redundant. Maybe "personally took each cup of tea."

In the paragraph about the jewels, "Rich jewels were brought forth, for Kuei Pingâ€™s own grandfather was a well known silk merchant and the coming alliance with an official family was not beyond the knowledge of Wong Lui, dealer in jewels." The phrase "was not beyond the knowledge of" is awkward. Maybe "was well known to" is better.

The sentence "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." This is a sudden shift in the narrative. The first part is about family restrictions, but the second part jumps to vital statistics without clear connection. It's confusing and might be a non-sequitur.

In the paragraph about the graduation day memory, "No uncertainty surrounds the nature of the generating impulse." This is a very formal and vague sentence. It doesn't connect well with the previous context and seems out of place.

The sentence "Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." The placement of "as in the twentieth, century" is awkward. It should be "as in the twentieth century."

For fluency issues, I notice a few grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and some redundant or unclear expressions. The text is mostly readable but has some minor issues that could affect flow.

Now, for coherence. The text tells a story about Yen Kuei Ping and her family visiting a jewelry shop. The narrative flows through the procession, the visit to the shop, and the interactions there. However, there are some abrupt shifts in the story. For example, the sudden mention of "Families are restricted..." and then the graduation day memory seem disconnected from the main narrative. These parts don't clearly tie into the overall story, causing confusion. The mention of Leicester Square and the eighteenth century also seems out of place and doesn't contribute to the coherence of the story. The transitions between these sections are abrupt, which affects the overall coherence. The story is generally well-structured, but these disjointed parts disrupt the flow and make the narrative less cohesive.

Considering all these points, the fluency score would be around 4, as there are minor issues but the text is mostly fluent. The coherence score would be 3.5, as the main narrative is coherent, but the abrupt shifts and disconnected parts affect the overall flow and structure.
