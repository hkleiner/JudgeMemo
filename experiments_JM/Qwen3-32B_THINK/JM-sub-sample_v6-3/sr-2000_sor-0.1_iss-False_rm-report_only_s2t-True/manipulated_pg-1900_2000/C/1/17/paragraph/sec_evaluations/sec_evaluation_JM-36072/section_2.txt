Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. I need to look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll go through the text paragraph by paragraph.

1. "There is hardly a "Lion Comique," or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene, who would commit such an offence to-day, and against these lapses from taste Sir Joshua's acquaintance with the best minds of his day failed to save him." This sentence is a bit long and complex, but the structure is mostly clear. The use of "blatant or obscene" as adjectives for songs is a bit awkward, but it's understandable. The phrase "drawing prime minister's salary" is a bit unclear in meaning (does it mean they earn as much as a prime minister?).

2. The next paragraph about the Báb in Persia is well-structured and flows naturally. It discusses his teachings and the impact he had on people, with clear transitions between ideas.

3. The paragraph about the war's effects on national sentiment and cultural isolation is a bit dense, but the ideas are connected logically. The sentence structure is mostly clear.

4. The section discussing the working class conditions and the quotes from Byron and the member of parliament is well-written and flows naturally.

5. The paragraph about over-population and the economists' views is also well-structured, with clear explanations.

6. The final paragraph about progress and Macaulay is clear and flows well.

Overall, I don't see any major grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would significantly disrupt the reading experience. There are some complex sentences, but they generally maintain clarity. The only minor issue I notice is in the first sentence where "drawing prime minister's salary" might be confusing. 

Now for coherence, I need to assess how well the ideas are connected and how logically the text progresses.

The text moves from discussing Sir Joshua's failures in taste to a completely different topic about millennialist movements in Persia. This is a significant shift without any transitional sentence to connect the ideas.

After the Persian movement section, the text shifts to discussing the effects of war on national sentiment and cultural isolation. This is another abrupt shift in topic without clear connection to the previous section about the Báb.

The text then moves to the working class conditions in England, which is a completely different topic again, with no clear connection to the previous section about war and isolation.

The paragraph on over-population and economists is another new topic without clear transition from the working class conditions.

The final paragraph about progress and Macaulay is yet another new topic, with no clear connection to the previous section about population.

These abrupt shifts between topics make the text feel disjointed and lacking in a clear narrative flow. The reader is taken from one topic to another without understanding how they're connected, which significantly impacts the coherence of the text.

Based on the fluency assessment, I would rate this as a 4.5 - the text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly disrupt the reading experience.

Based on the coherence assessment, I would rate this as a 2 - the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas with no clear progression or logical sequencing between topics.

Wait, let me re-read the text and reconsider my assessment.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that the text actually appears to be a collection of different essays or sections discussing various historical topics with no clear connection between them. The topics jump from Sir Joshua Reynolds to Persian millennialist movements to the effects of war on national sentiment to working class conditions in England to over-population and finally to progress in the 19th century. These are all distinct topics with no obvious narrative thread connecting them.

The fluency issues I identified earlier are minimal and don't significantly impact comprehension. However, the coherence issues are more significant, as the text lacks a clear structure or logical progression.

Given these observations, I would revise my scores:
- Fluency: 4.5 - mostly fluent with only minor issues
- Coherence: 2 - frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas with no clear progression

Let me re-read once more to confirm.

The text is indeed a collection of different historical topics with no clear connection between them. The abrupt shifts between topics make it difficult to follow a coherent narrative. The only connection I can perceive is that they're all historical topics, but that's not sufficient for coherence.

The fluency is generally good, with only minor issues that don't significantly impact readability.

So my final assessment remains:
- Fluency: 4.5
- Coherence: 2

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene" creates confusion about meaning
- [CLARITY] Ambiguity in "drawing prime minister's salary" - unclear if this means earning as much as a prime minister or receiving a salary from the prime minister
- [STRUCTURE] Some complex sentences (e.g., the first paragraph) could be clearer with better punctuation

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from discussing Sir Joshua to Persian millennialist movements with no transitional sentence
- [LOGIC] Sudden transition from Persian movement to war effects on national sentiment without connection
- [STRUCTURE] Disconnected jump from war effects to working class conditions in England
- [COHESION] No clear narrative thread connecting the different historical topics presented
- [TRANSITION] Lack of transitional phrases between completely separate topics

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
