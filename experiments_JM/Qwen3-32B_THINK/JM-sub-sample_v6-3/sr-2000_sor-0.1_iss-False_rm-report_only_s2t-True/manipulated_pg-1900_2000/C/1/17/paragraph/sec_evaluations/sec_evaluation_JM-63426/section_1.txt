Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a long text split into two chapters: an introduction about Will Bradley and his chap book, and a chapter about his early life. I need to assess the fluency and coherence of the current segment, which is the second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming." The first chapter is the context but shouldn't be evaluated.

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. The text is written in a narrative style with some complex sentences. I notice a few areas where the phrasing might be awkward or where there could be minor errors. For example, "You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to the factories and return with a supply of unfinished." The sentence structure here is simple but effective. However, in "When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font you file them to fit the type slot in the press," the lack of a comma after "font" might make it slightly harder to read. Also, "He brings you a box of pi." Wait, "pi" is the Greek letter, but in the context of printing, it's likely a typo for "type" or "letters." That's a spelling issue. Another example: "the pi" might be "type" or "printing type."

Looking for other fluency issues. The sentence "They are strangers to doubt and uncertainty; they disarm Fortune by claiming freely as a right what she is accustomed to grant grudgingly as a favour--" has a missing apostrophe in "favour" (if it's British English, but the text uses "color" variations like "favour" which is correct in British English). The em dash usage is correct. The sentence structure here is complex but not incorrect. There's a possible missing comma after "grudgingly as a favour," but it's a stylistic choice. The phrase "They ride Life's lists as a knight might ride." The possessive "Life's" is correct. 

Another part: "You are on the 'Narrow Gauge' on your way to Boston." The use of quotation marks around "Narrow Gauge" might be appropriate if it's a specific term, but it's not clear if it's a proper noun. The sentence structure is okay. "You are sucking a 'picklelime,' always found in glass jars..." The hyphen in "picklelime" might be a compound word, but it's written as two words here. Maybe it's a typo for "pickled lime" or a specific term. If it's a compound, the hyphen is missing. 

In "At Thompsonville, Connecticut, you go to school for a few weeks. On circus day you are allowed to have a vacation." The transition between these sentences is abrupt, but it's part of the narrative flow, so maybe not a fluency issue. 

Overall, the fluency seems mostly good, but there are a few minor issues like the possible typo in "pi" (should be "type"), missing punctuation, and some awkward phrasing. These are minor and don't significantly disrupt readability. 

Now for coherence. The chapter is a narrative about Bradley's early life, presented in a chronological manner. The flow is logical, moving from his early years, his work in the shoe industry, his journey to Boston, and then to Northern Michigan. The transitions between events are smooth. However, there's a shift in the middle where it discusses a broader theme about individuals destined for success. The sentence "There are certain men born to every generation..." seems a bit out of place in the narrative about Bradley's childhood. It's a general statement that might not connect as smoothly to the personal story, creating a slight disconnect. 

Another point: the text jumps from the boy's experiences to a philosophical statement about success, then back to his journey. This might create a minor abrupt transition. Also, the mention of the "Narrow Gauge" and the "picklelime" might be specific terms that are not explained, which could confuse some readers, but since it's a narrative, it's part of the character's experience. 

The overall structure is coherent, with a clear progression of events. The only noticeable issue is the shift in tone and content in the middle paragraph, which might slightly disrupt the flow. However, the rest of the text maintains a logical sequence. 

For the fluency score, considering the minor issues but overall smooth reading, a 4.5 is appropriate. For coherence, the slight disconnect in the middle paragraph lowers it to a 4.5 as well.
