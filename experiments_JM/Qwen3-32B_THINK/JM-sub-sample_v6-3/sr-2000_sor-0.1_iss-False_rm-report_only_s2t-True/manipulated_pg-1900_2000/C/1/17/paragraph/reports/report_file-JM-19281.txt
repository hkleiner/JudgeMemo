Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "if the religious crisis is to be addressed as seriously as is occurring with respect to other prejudices" (missing "it" for clarity).
        • Unclear antecedent in "these populations were plunged into a crisis different from but in many ways even more devastating than the one gathering momentum in Europe and North America" (ambiguity in "one").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Slightly formal tone with complex phrasing in "the Hand of Divine power can, alone, deliver mankind from this desolating affliction" (word choice could be simpler).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift in sentence structure between paragraphs discussing industrial revolution and spiritual awakening.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition from industrial revolution description to 20th-century materialism discussion without connecting logic.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Isolated sentence "Lemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen" with no contextual connection.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift to "Toward the end of His life, Bahá’u’lláh’s writings on His early experiences included a brief description of the conditions in the Síyáh-Chál" without explanatory context.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Confusing comparison between "crisis" in colonized populations and European/North American crisis without clear differentiation.
