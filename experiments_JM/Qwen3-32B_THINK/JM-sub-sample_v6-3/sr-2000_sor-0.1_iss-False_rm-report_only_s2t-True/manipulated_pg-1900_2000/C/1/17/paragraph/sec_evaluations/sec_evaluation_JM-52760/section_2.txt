Alright, I'll evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence according to the given criteria.

First, I'll look at the text and identify any fluency issues:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "It was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house of one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to come into Boucher's life in after years." This sentence is grammatically awkward with its structure and word choice.
- [SPELLING] "mis-handling" should be "mis-handling" with a hyphen (though this is a matter of style rather than error).
- [SYNTAX] "The father, a financial fellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under banishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the birth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette Poisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the years to come." This sentence is overly complex and difficult to follow.
- [LEXICON] "girl-child" is an unusual and somewhat archaic term choice.
- [SYNTAX] "Ludovico Caracci and Guido had given him hints that were of infinite value in the moulding of his technique; for colour he had gone to Titian, Tintoretto, and Rubens, of whom the last named was beginning to lose his appeal in the last years of Reynolds' life." This sentence is convoluted and difficult to parse.
- [STRUCTURE] The text suddenly shifts from discussing Petersburg's transportation system to a completely different narrative about someone named Boucher and a girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, which seems disconnected from the rest of the text.
- [STRUCTURE] The text then shifts to discussing Reynolds and art history, which is another disconnected narrative.

Now for coherence issues:

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from discussing Petersburg's transportation system to a narrative about someone named Boucher and a girl named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, with no clear connection to the previous content.
- [LOGIC] After this, the text shifts to discussing Reynolds and art history, which is another disconnected narrative with no clear connection to either the Petersburg transportation system or the Boucher/Poisson narrative.
- [TRANSITION] There is no transition or explanation connecting these different narratives.
- [CLARITY] The purpose and focus of the text become unclear with these sudden shifts in subject matter.
- [STRUCTURE] The text appears to be a collection of unrelated passages that have been pasted together without regard for logical flow or coherence.

Based on these issues, I would rate the text as follows:

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 1.5 (The text has significant coherence issues with abrupt shifts in subject matter and disconnected narratives that make it difficult to follow as a whole.)

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5 (The text contains several grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and unusual word choices that affect readability, though it remains generally understandable.)

Wait, let me re-evaluate my coherence score. The text has serious coherence issues with multiple disconnected narratives, but it's possible that these are different sections that were simply pasted together. Given that the user mentioned the text may be a section extracted from a longer document, I might be too harsh in my assessment.

Upon reconsideration, I'll adjust my scores:

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0 (The text has significant coherence issues with multiple disconnected narratives that make it difficult to follow as a whole.)

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0 (The text contains several grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but it remains generally understandable.)

Actually, let me re-evaluate again. The text has serious fluency issues with awkward phrasing and unusual word choices, but it's still generally understandable. I'm being too generous.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 1.5 (The text has significant coherence issues with abrupt shifts in subject matter and disconnected narratives that make it difficult to follow as a whole.)

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5 (The text contains several grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and unusual word choices that affect readability, though it remains generally understandable.)

Wait, I'm being inconsistent with my scoring. Let me re-evaluate both scores more carefully:

For fluency:
- The text has several grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and unusual word choices.
- Some sentences are convoluted and difficult to parse.
- However, the text remains generally understandable despite these issues.
- I would rate this as a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

For coherence:
- The text has serious coherence issues with multiple disconnected narratives.
- There are abrupt shifts in subject matter with no clear connections.
- The text appears to be a collection of unrelated passages.
- This would rate as a 1.5 on the coherence scale.

I'll finalize my assessment as:
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 1.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5

Actually, let me review one more time for consistency. The text has significant coherence issues with disconnected narratives and abrupt shifts in subject matter. The fluency issues are noticeable but don't make the text completely unintelligible. I think my scores are accurate.
