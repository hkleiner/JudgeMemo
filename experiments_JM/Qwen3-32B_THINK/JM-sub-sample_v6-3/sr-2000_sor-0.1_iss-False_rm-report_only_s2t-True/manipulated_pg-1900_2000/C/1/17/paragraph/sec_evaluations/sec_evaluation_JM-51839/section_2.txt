Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the provided criteria. Let's start with fluency.

First, I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The text is a historical narrative, so it's in a formal style. Let me read through it again carefully.

Looking at the first paragraph: "The city of Nacogdoches... on the Trinity river, to the old Mission of Guadalupe." The sentence structure is a bit long, but it's clear. No obvious grammar issues here. Next, "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity..." The word "quantity" here is a bit awkward; maybe "area" would be better, but it's still understandable. 

Moving on to the second paragraph about the women and François: "Then the women folk, bored with high politics..." The term "women folk" is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. The transition from the previous paragraph is a bit abrupt. The sentence about the Saturday child is clear, though the phrasing "bound to be a bit of a scamp" is a bit informal but acceptable in context.

In the section about Gil Ybarbo's title: "Gil Ybarbo, ruling his people as a benevolent despot..." The title is correctly written with commas. The sentence about the Book of Ordinances in 1780 is clear. 

The paragraph about the population growth and the investigation by Don Ramon de Castro: The sentences are a bit long but still readable. The mention of Ybarbo's removal and his successors is straightforward. 

In the Philip Nolan chapter: The sentences are well-structured. Terms like "reared by General James Wilkinson" are correctly used. The mention of Aaron Burr as Vice President is accurate. 

The part about the population being "largely behind Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his Garrison" – the capital "Garrison" might be unnecessary, but it's not a major issue. 

In the engagement description: "Nolan was overtaken on the banks of the Blanco river..." The sentence is clear. The mention of the Old Stone Fort and the captives is well-explained. 

The section about the correspondence and the conspirators: The names and titles are correctly used. The sentence about Padre Bernadino Vallejo being saved by his robes is clear. 

The last paragraph about the Louisiana Purchase and the territorial dispute: The sentences are concise and the information is presented logically. 

For fluency, I don't notice any major grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. The syntax is mostly correct, though some sentences are long. There are a few instances where word choice could be improved (like "quantity" instead of "area"), but these are minor. 

Now for coherence. The text is a historical account with multiple sections. The transition from the founding of Nacogdoches to the Philip Nolan chapter is smooth. Each paragraph flows logically to the next, covering different events and periods. The time references are clear, and the cause-effect relationships are well-explained. For example, the investigation leading to Ybarbo's removal is followed by his successors. The connection between the Louisiana Purchase and the changes in Nacogdoches is explained. 

However, there's a slight abrupt transition between the section on Ybarbo's removal and the Philip Nolan chapter. The reader might need to infer the connection between the two. Also, the mention of "Saturday child" in the middle of a historical narrative is a bit jarring, but it's a minor issue. 

Overall, the text is coherent with a logical progression. The ideas are connected, and the narrative is structured well. There are no major inconsistencies or confusing parts. 

For fluency score: There are minor issues with word choice and a few long sentences, but nothing that disrupts readability. I'd say a 4.5. 

For coherence score: The text is mostly coherent with a few minor transitions that could be smoother, but overall it's well-structured. I'd give a 4.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the necessity for the Spanish garrison... ceased" (passive voice disrupts flow).  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic terms like "bewildered followers" and "Saturday child" (may confuse modern readers).  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing article in "Louisiana belonged to Spain, and the government was but little concerned..." (should be "the government was *but little* concerned to mark...").  
- [STRUCTURE] Cumbersome sentence structure in "He promulgated the first Book of Ordinances... in the Capitol at Austin" (clarity lost due to length).  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "In 1792 General Don Ramon de Castro" (disrupts readability).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Ybarbo’s governance to the women discussing "infant François" (no clear contextual link).  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from Nolan’s expedition to the Louisiana Purchase’s impact (missing transitional explanation).  
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "the population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant Musquiz" (subject-verb agreement inconsistency).  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of "Ybarbo" in consecutive paragraphs without clear progression.  
- [CONTEXT] Uncertain connection between the "Saturday child" anecdote and the broader historical narrative.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
