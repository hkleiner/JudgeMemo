Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency and coherence of the given text.

### Fluency Issues:

1. **[SYNTAX]** The sentence "You _haven't_ seen it? Then you must." is incomplete and lacks a verb after "must."
2. **[GRAMMAR]** The phrase "The man has actually got _at_ you, at what _I_ always feel, you know." uses non-standard phrasing and is grammatically awkward.
3. **[SYNTAX]** "He showed how much he was when before us all Lady Jane wanted to read something aloud." is a run-on sentence and lacks clarity.
4. **[GRAMMAR]** "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." is awkwardly phrased.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** "If the author was 'only me' the thing didn’t seem quite so remarkable." is missing a comma after "me."
6. **[SYNTAX]** "Hadn’t I had the effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding to my own?" is a complex sentence that's difficult to parse.
7. **[GRAMMAR]** "I did give her pleasure, I judged, but perhaps not quite so much as I had expected." has an awkward placement of "I judged."
8. **[SPELLING]** "artless body" is an unusual and potentially confusing phrase.
9. **[GRAMMAR]** "carrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as treasure." is awkwardly phrased.
10. **[SYNTAX]** "To the little fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of Oudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news of Malplaquet." is a long, complex sentence that's difficult to follow.
11. **[GRAMMAR]** "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort." is a general statement that's somewhat abstract and lacks clarity.
12. **[SYNTAX]** "Where they have none, the vital statistics are those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." is an abrupt and disconnected sentence from the previous one.
13. **[GRAMMAR]** "Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth. 'Oh, you’re so deep!' she drove home." is a bit awkward in phrasing.

### Coherence Issues:

1. **[STRUCTURE]** The text shifts abruptly from a conversation at a dinner party to a historical account of Louis XIV and then back to the dinner party, with no clear transition or explanation.
2. **[LOGIC]** The jump from discussing the dinner conversation to the historical events is illogical and confusing.
3. **[LOGIC]** The statement about family size and social ambitions is disconnected from the preceding and following text.
4. **[TRANSITION]** The transition from the historical account to the final conversation at the dinner is abrupt and lacks coherence.
5. **[LOGIC]** The final dialogue between Miss Poyle and the character is disconnected from the historical content and doesn't flow naturally from the previous section.

### Fluency Score:
The text has several grammatical and syntactical issues that affect its readability. While it's generally understandable, the frequent awkward phrasing and incomplete sentences reduce its fluency. I would rate this as a 2.5, as it has frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make comprehension sometimes difficult.

### Coherence Score:
The text has major coherence issues due to the abrupt shifts in topic and the lack of logical transitions between the dinner party conversation, the historical account, and the family statistics. The disjointed nature of the text makes it difficult to follow the narrative. I would rate this as a 2, as the text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort.
