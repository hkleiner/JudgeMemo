Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. First, I'll go through the text and look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice and syntax.

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure is complex but generally clear. There's a lot of descriptive language, which is common in literary texts. I notice some commas are used correctly to separate clauses, and the sentences flow well. However, in the sentence "One would not say that he was the greatest painter of his time--Gainsborough's gifts exceeded his in many directions, and Romney enters into competition too--but Reynolds was born under a fortunate star..." the em dashes are used effectively to set off parenthetical statements, which is appropriate here. 

Moving on, the sentence "One night, in a dream, these exalted words were heard on every side: â€œVerily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy Pen..." has a shift in voice from third-person to a more direct quote, which is handled well. The use of "Thy" and "Thee" is archaic but fits the context of a dream or divine message. The punctuation here is correct, and the quotation is properly formatted.

In the sentence "Thus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling, for he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous disposition..." the em dash is used to introduce a clause that explains the state of the purse. This is a bit complex but still understandable. The phrase "being of a free hand and generous disposition" is a bit old-fashioned but still clear.

The next paragraph discusses the changes in transportation and industry. The sentence structure is straightforward and logical. There's a slight issue with the phrase "the fast sailing clippers had a short lease of life before steam was used for crossing the seas." The phrase "short lease of life" is a bit archaic but still understandable. The use of "lease of life" is correct in the sense of a limited duration, though it's not commonly used today.

In the sentence "The greatest sufferings caused by the revolution in the life of the people were in the first half of the century; the latter half was a time of readjustment and reform." The semicolon is used correctly to connect two independent clauses. The structure is clear and the ideas are logically connected.

The paragraph about Italy and Reynolds' art is well-structured. The sentence "Art will not yield to inspiration alone. The musician, or the literary man, with very simple education may be able to achieve wonders..." uses parallel structure correctly. The transition between ideas is smooth.

The section about Reynolds' years in Italy and his apprenticeship has some complex sentences but they are generally well-constructed. The use of em dashes and commas to separate clauses is appropriate. The sentence "Hudson gave his pupil Guercino's drawings to copy. Before the time of apprenticeship had expired Reynolds had quarrelled with his master and gone back to Devonshire..." uses past perfect tense correctly to indicate an action completed before another past action.

In the paragraph about Michelangelo's influence, the sentence "In later days he never lost an opportunity of advising students to sit at the feet of the great master..." uses "sit at the feet of" as a metaphor, which is clear and appropriate. The sentence structure is complex but not confusing.

The section about Ludovico Caracci and Guido is well-written, with clear explanations of their influence on Reynolds' technique. The sentence "There is no doubt that the sixteenth-century Venetians impressed Reynolds as much as they impressed Ruskin at a later date..." uses parallel structure effectively.

The paragraph about Reynolds' behavior in Italy and his self-control has some complex sentences but they are well-structured. The use of "it is hard to find any justification for the belief that Reynolds was at any time of his life a free liver." is a bit wordy but still clear.

The section on Reynolds' discourses to the Royal Academy is well-structured, with clear explanations of his teaching methods. The sentence "A musican knows that the laws of harmony and counterpoint are not fixed..." contains a spelling error ("musican" should be "musician"). This is a minor issue but affects fluency.

The paragraph about Reynolds returning to England and his injuries is clear and well-structured. The use of em dashes and commas to separate clauses is appropriate. The sentence "So he took holiday in the county he loved so well..." uses "holiday" in the British sense, which is correct but might be confusing for some readers.

The final paragraph is very short: "Many artists remain painters all their lives." It's a complete sentence but seems abrupt and disconnected from the rest of the text. It doesn't contribute much to the overall flow and might be a leftover or a fragment.

In terms of fluency, the text is generally well-written with complex sentences that are mostly clear. There are a few instances of archaic language and some wordiness, but these do not significantly impact readability. The only major issue is the spelling error in "musican" and the abrupt ending. These would warrant a score of 4.5 for fluency.

Now, moving on to coherence. I'll assess how the ideas in the text are connected and whether the progression of ideas is logical and smooth.

The text begins with a general statement about religious leadership and then shifts to discussing Joshua Reynolds as an artist. This shift is a bit abrupt and doesn't connect logically with the initial statement. The reader might be confused about the connection between the two topics.

The discussion of Reynolds' life and influences is well-structured, with a chronological progression from his early life, apprenticeship, time in Italy, and later career. The transitions between these sections are smooth, and the ideas are logically connected.

However, the paragraph about the revolution in transportation and industry is somewhat disjointed. The sentence "But there can be no question that the river of civilisation reached a stretch of rapids towards the end of the eighteenth century." uses a metaphor that is somewhat unclear. The following examples of changes in transportation and industry are relevant but the connection to the metaphor is not fully explained, making the paragraph feel a bit disconnected.

The section about Reynolds' discourses to the Royal Academy and his teaching methods is well-connected to his role as an influential artist. The ideas here flow logically from his career and influence.

The final paragraph about Reynolds' return to England and his injuries is well-connected to his earlier life. However, the last sentence "Many artists remain painters all their lives." is abrupt and doesn't connect logically to the previous paragraph. It seems out of place and doesn't contribute to the overall coherence of the text.

In terms of coherence, the text is mostly well-structured with logical progression of ideas. However, the initial shift from religious leadership to Reynolds' art is abrupt and the final sentence is disconnected. The metaphor about the river of civilization is not fully explained, causing some confusion. These issues would warrant a score of 4 for coherence.
