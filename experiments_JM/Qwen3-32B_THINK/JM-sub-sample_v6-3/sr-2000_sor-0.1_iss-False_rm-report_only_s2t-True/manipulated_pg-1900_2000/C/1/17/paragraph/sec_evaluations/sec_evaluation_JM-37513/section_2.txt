Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The text is quite dense with complex sentences and philosophical terminology. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with punctuation.

First, the sentence structure is intricate, with long, compound sentences. For example, "Just because Spencer's interpretation is all-inclusive; because biology, psychology, sociology, ethics are, broadly considered, concerned only with incidents of the later scenes of the great mechanical drama of evolution." The semicolon here might be better replaced with a period or a colon for clarity. The use of "because" at the start of the sentence is a bit abrupt.

There's also some repetition and redundancy, like "It is true that the affairs of the mind give pause and seem to present something of a difficulty." This could be streamlined for better flow. The phrase "concomitant evolution of mind" is a bit of a mouthful and might be simplified for clarity.

The sentence "But if all existence, distinguishable as subjective, is resolvable into units of consciousness, which in their obverse or objective aspect are oscillations of molecules, what more is required to round off the explanation of every thing, save the Unknowable--save the Ultimate Reality in which subject and object are united?" is a long, complex sentence with multiple clauses. While it's grammatically correct, it might be challenging for some readers to follow without a comma or two for better pacing.

Moving on to coherence. The text is a philosophical argument, so the logical flow is crucial. The main idea is that Spencer's interpretation is all-encompassing, covering various fields under the umbrella of evolution. The author then discusses the challenges of explaining mental evolution in terms of matter and motion, and finally concludes with the concept of the Unknowable.

The transitions between these ideas are generally smooth, but there are a few points where the connection between sentences could be clearer. For instance, the shift from discussing the difficulty of mental evolution to the antithesis of subject and object is a bit abrupt. The reader might need a smoother transition to follow the argument.

The use of rhetorical questions, such as "Do not these fundamental articles of his faith deal with ubiquitous causes..." in the context section, sets up the current section's discussion. However, the current section doesn't explicitly reference this, which might make the connection between the two sections less clear for someone reading only the current section.

The conclusion about the Unknowable and the final quote about Matter and Mind are well-placed, but the leap from the complex explanation to the final statement might benefit from a more explicit link to show how it resolves the previous discussion.

Overall, the text is coherent in its argument, but some parts could use smoother transitions and clearer connections between ideas to enhance the logical flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures with excessive subclauses that hinder readability. - [LEXICON] Use of obscure philosophical terminology ("obverse or objective aspect," "concomitant evolution") that may confuse readers. - [PUNCTUATION] Misuse of semicolons and lack of proper breaks in long sentences. - [CLARITY] Redundant phrasing ("It is true that... It is true that...") and wordy expressions. - [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between abstract concepts without clear signposting.
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Sudden leap from discussing Spencer's philosophy to the "Unknowable" without clear logical scaffolding. - [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow between biological evolution and mental evolution explanations. - [CLARITY] Ambiguous connections between "oscillations of molecules" and "units of consciousness." - [TRANSITION] Unclear linkage between the concluding quote and the preceding argumentation. - [CONCEPTUAL] Confusing treatment of subject/object duality and its resolution through the "Ultimate Reality."
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
