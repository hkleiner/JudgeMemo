Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The user wants me to look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll go through the text paragraph by paragraph. The first part seems to be a historical account about the discovery of tablets in Egypt. The sentences are generally well-structured. However, I notice some instances where the phrasing might be a bit awkward. For example, "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." uses a somewhat archaic or old-fashioned expression that might confuse some readers. Also, in the part about Reynolds, the sentence structure is a bit complex: "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise his own limitations..." The placement of "soon" after "became" feels off. It should probably be "He soon became a painter..." to be more natural.

Another example is the sentence about the Royal Academy: "Himself far above the squabbles of the hour, he raised the Royal Academy into the serene and almost untroubled atmosphere in which he lived his life." The phrase "Himself far above..." is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity. 

Looking at the part about the Babylonian scribes, the sentence "The sources of the letters may be distinguished also by the colour and consistency of the material of the tablets..." uses "also" in a place that might be better omitted for smoother flow. 

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a historical narrative, so coherence would involve logical progression and clear transitions between ideas. The text starts with the discovery of tablets, moves to the historical context of the Pharaohs, and then shifts to Reynolds and the Royal Academy. Wait, that shift seems abrupt. The mention of Reynolds in the middle of discussing Egyptian tablets is quite jarring. There's no clear transition or connection between these two topics. This is a major coherence issue because it disrupts the flow of the narrative without any apparent reason. 

Additionally, the text jumps from discussing the tablets and their language to a completely different subject about Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. This is another abrupt transition that lacks a logical connection. The reader is left wondering why this information is included here. 

Looking at the structure of the chapters, each chapter seems to be a separate topic, but the transition between them is not smooth. The first chapter ends with a discussion of the tablets, then the second chapter starts with the Pharaohs, which is related, but the mention of Reynolds and Bahá’u’lláh in between breaks the continuity. 

There are also some unclear transitions within the chapters. For example, after discussing the Pharaohs, the text moves to the Colossi of Memnon and the king's wife, which is a bit disjointed without a clear link to the previous content. 

In terms of the evaluation criteria, the fluency issues are mostly minor but noticeable. The awkward phrasing and some archaic expressions might distract but don't severely hinder understanding. The coherence issues are more significant, especially the abrupt shifts between unrelated topics. These shifts make the text harder to follow and reduce its overall coherence. 

So for fluency, considering the minor issues but mostly fluent text, a score of 4 seems appropriate. For coherence, the major issues with transitions and structure would lower the score to 3.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "He became soon a painter strong enough to realise..." (awkward word order)  
- [LEXICON] "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." (archaic phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "Himself far above the squabbles of the hour, he raised the Royal Academy..." (awkward structure)  
- [PHRASING] "The sources of the letters may be distinguished also by the colour..." (awkward placement of "also")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Egyptian tablets to Reynolds and the Royal Academy (unrelated topics)  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from tablets to Bahá’u’lláh’s writings (no contextual link)  
- [TRANSITION] Disjointed flow between chapters and subtopics (e.g., Pharaohs to Memnon Colossi to religious reform)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
