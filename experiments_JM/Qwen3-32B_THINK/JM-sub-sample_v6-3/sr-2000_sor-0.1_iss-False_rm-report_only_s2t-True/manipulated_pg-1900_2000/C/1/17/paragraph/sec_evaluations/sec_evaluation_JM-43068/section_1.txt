Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. First, I'll read through the entire section to get a sense of how it flows. The text is about Millet and his place in the history of peasant painting, comparing him with other artists like Brueghel and the Dutch painters. 

Looking for fluency issues, I notice some possible problems. There's a sentence that says, "An exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed him..." Here, the subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be "has" instead of "have." That's a grammar issue. 

Another sentence: "The French peasant, with the partial uplifting..." The phrase "partial uplifting" might be a bit awkward. Maybe "partial uplift" without the "ing" would be smoother. That's a lexicon or phrasing issue.

Then there's the line, "Well might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing defeat." The transition here is a bit abrupt. The first part is a bit archaic or unclear, and the next sentence starts with a sudden shift to the French military. That could be a syntax or structure problem. 

Also, the sentence "The two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most touching..." uses "symbolical," which is a less common word. While not incorrect, it might be better as "symbolic." That's a lexicon choice. 

Another spot: "The only softening influence in their lives is that imparted by religion..." The phrase "imparted by" is a bit formal and might be replaced with "provided by" for smoother reading. Again, a lexicon issue.

Now, moving to coherence. The text starts by discussing Millet and his predecessors, then shifts to the historical context of the French and Dutch periods. There's a section about the aristocracy and their role, which seems a bit out of place compared to the previous discussion about Millet's art. This might be a structure or transition issue. 

The sentence about the English aristocracy and their collections seems to be a tangent, not directly related to Millet's work. This could be a logic or structure problem, as it's not clear how this connects to the main topic. 

The text also jumps from discussing Millet's techniques to a historical military context ("The French arms were knowing defeat..."), which is a significant shift without a clear transition. This abrupt change in topic might affect coherence. 

Additionally, the mention of the Provost's Lodge at Eton and family portraits is specific and might not be necessary for the main argument, making the text feel a bit disjointed. That's another coherence issue related to relevance and structure. 

Putting this all together, the fluency issues are mainly grammatical and word choice, while coherence issues involve some abrupt transitions and tangential information that disrupts the flow of the main argument about Millet's art and its context.
