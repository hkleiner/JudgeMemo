Alright, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to look at the Fluency and Coherence of the provided text. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll scan through for any obvious grammar, spelling, or syntax issues. I notice a few places where the sentence structure might be a bit awkward. For example, "the Industrial Revolution began in reality before the accession of George III" – the phrase "in reality" feels a bit out of place there. There's also "the French monarchy was stricken with mortal disease before Louis XV bequeathed his kingdom to his luckless successor." The word "stricken" is correct, but the sentence structure could be smoother. 

Looking for spelling errors, I don't see any glaring ones. Words like "mile-stone" are hyphenated, which is correct. "Revels of Neptune" is capitalized correctly. There's a mention of "Bahá’u’lláh" with proper diacritics. 

Syntax-wise, some sentences are a bit long and complex. For example, "the anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven by four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under the bow of the ship." The structure here is a bit convoluted, but it's still understandable. 

Punctuation seems mostly correct. Commas are used appropriately, and there's a good use of periods to break up sentences. However, in "the value of the robe is over three hundred thousand dollars," the sentence feels a bit abrupt after the detailed description, but it's not a major issue.

Moving on to Coherence. The text starts with a preface and then moves into Chapter I. The narrative flows from the author's introduction to the historical context of the Industrial Revolution and the French monarchy, then transitions to the event of sending teachers to the Philippines. The transition from the historical background to the specific event is a bit abrupt. The reader might wonder how the Industrial Revolution and French monarchy relate to the main topic of the book. 

There's a shift from discussing historical movements to the specific event of the teachers' journey. The connection between these parts isn't entirely clear. The mention of the Industrial Revolution and French monarchy seems to set the stage for the importance of the event, but it's not explicitly explained how these historical points lead to the teachers' mission. 

In the section about the Bishop Museum, the transition from the Pali to the museum is smooth, but the detailed description of the robe and the bird feathers is a bit tangential. The reader might lose the thread of the main narrative here. The mention of the Bahá’í Faith and Arnold Toynbee's observations seems out of place in the middle of the voyage narrative. This could be a coherence issue because it breaks the flow of the story about the journey to the Philippines.

The ending of Chapter I jumps back to the narrative of crossing the International Date Line, which ties back to the voyage. However, the mention of the Bahá’í Faith and Toynbee's note is a sudden shift that might confuse readers. The connection between the Bahá’í Faith's development and the voyage isn't clear, making this part feel disjointed.

Overall, the text has some minor fluency issues with sentence structure and transitions, but nothing that severely hinders readability. Coherence has a few points where the narrative jumps or shifts topics without clear connections, but the overall story is still understandable. Considering these points, I'd rate Fluency around 4 and Coherence around 3.5, as the text is mostly fluent and coherent but has some noticeable issues in transitions and topic shifts.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the Industrial Revolution began in reality before the accession of George III" (redundant "in reality").
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome structure in "the anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven by four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under the bow of the ship."
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from historical analysis to nautical voyage without clear transitional phrases.
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous reference to "our last passenger" without clear antecedent.
- [PUNCTUATION] Comma splice in "We passed on and as their fountains of spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down..."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Disjointed transition from historical analysis of revolutions to Philippine education mission without clear causal link.
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden insertion of Bahá’í Faith/Toynbee reference in middle of voyage narrative creates jarring conceptual shift.
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from museum description to surf-shooting to date line crossing without narrative cohesion.
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between Industrial Revolution/French monarchy and Philippine education mission.
- [STRUCTURE] Disconnected segments on Hawaiian landmarks and Bahá’í history within single voyage narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
