Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency Issues. The user wants me to identify problems related to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll go through the text line by line.

First, I notice some awkward phrasing like "acting on the advice of his friend and patron, Lord Edgcumbe." The structure here is a bit clunky. Then there's "Thanks to the quality of his work and the patronage granted so freely," which is okay, but maybe "granted so freely" could be smoother. 

Next, "A little later he moved to Great Newport Street, where the accommodation was better suited to the growing claims of sitters." The phrase "better suited to the growing claims of sitters" is a bit confusing. "Claims" here might not be the best word choice. 

In the sentence about moving to 47 Leicester Square, the phrase "now an auction-house" is a fragment. It should be connected properly. Then, "He had human weaknesses to live down, and it is to his credit that he conquered all or most of them." The transition here is abrupt. 

Looking at "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist, and his references to a thing Romney..." The phrase "a thing Romney" is unclear. Maybe it's a typo for "the painter Romney"? 

In the next part, "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people..." The word "until" is used incorrectly here. It should probably be "but" or "until he learned refinement, he was vulgar." 

Then there's "the coach in which his unfortunate sister Frances was compelled to drive in order that the man in the street might stare open-mouthed and talk about her brother." The structure is a bit wordy and the meaning is clear but the phrasing is awkward. 

Lastly, "It is far more interesting to see great men as they lived." The phrase "as they lived" might be better as "as they lived their lives" for clarity.

Moving on to Coherence Issues. The text is about Reynolds' life and his relationships. The flow between paragraphs is mostly smooth, but there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from his professional success to his personal weaknesses is a bit jarring. 

The paragraph about Dr. Johnson starts with "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company..." but it's not clear how this connects to the previous paragraph about Reynolds' friends. 

The mention of "the thing" in "when he established himself in the thing" is unclear and disrupts the flow. Also, the reference to "a thing Romney" is confusing and affects the coherence. 

The final paragraph discussing the atmosphere of Leicester Square and the faults of Reynolds the man vs. his work is a bit disjointed. It shifts topics abruptly without clear transitions.

Now, assigning the scores. For Fluency, the text has several awkward phrases and some grammatical issues, but it's generally readable. I'd say a 3.5. For Coherence, there are some abrupt shifts and unclear references, but the overall structure is understandable. I'll go with a 3.
