Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "I must not accept just a mere job" (redundant phrasing with "just a mere")
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful compliment of such an entry to the teaching profession" (awkward and complex sentence structure)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "The seating was in bad condition, as little or no care had been taken to keep the proper distance between the desks and the seats" (confusing reference to "desks and the seats" as separate entities)
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "the meeting of the thing in Detroit" (likely a placeholder/typo with "thing" instead of a specific organization)
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing comma before closing quotation in "In fact," he said, "the superintendent forgot..."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between the two main stories (superintendent neglect vs. proactive teacher) without clear connection
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Unclear reference to "the meeting of the thing in Detroit" disrupts narrative flow
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from one chapter to the next without transitional phrases
    - [CONTEXT]:
        • Timeline inconsistency between 1916 meeting and earlier narrative

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Run-on sentences and complex structures hinder readability (e.g., "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted...").
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Misuse of em dash in "business--'dress sense.'" - [WORD CHOICE] Awkward phrasing in "based upon a fragmentary educational foundation."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from "dress sense" to "mediocre preparation").
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from young man's promotion request to young woman's specialization without clear connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Some sentences lack clear subject-verb agreement or are overly wordy (e.g., "He reported that he could not use a teacher...").
