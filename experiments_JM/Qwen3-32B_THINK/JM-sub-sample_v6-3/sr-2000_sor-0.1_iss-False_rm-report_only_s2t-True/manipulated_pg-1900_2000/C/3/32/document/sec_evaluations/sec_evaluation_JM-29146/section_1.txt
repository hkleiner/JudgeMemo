Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues in the text. First, I notice a lot of spelling errors. For example, "ith" should be "is," "thith" is likely "this," and "thurrender" is "surrender." These are clear [SPELLING] mistakes. Then there are grammatical errors. The sentence structure in "He was a big man even by the thing standards" is awkward and confusing. The word "thing" here doesn't make sense in context. That's a [GRAMMAR] issue. 

Looking at syntax, some sentences are run-on or have incorrect punctuation. For instance, "He doubted if half a dozen Irwadians had mastered it, yet the Irwadi branch of the thing was made up of seventy-five hyper-space pilots of divers planetalities." The phrase "of the thing" is unclear and should probably be "Interstellar Transfer Service." This is a [SYNTAX] problem. 

There are also issues with word choice. The term "thing" is used multiple times where it should be a specific organization's name, like "Interstellar Transfer Service." This is a [LEXICON] error. Additionally, the use of "ecthra-planetarieth" and "theth" with extra letters is a [SPELLING] issue. 

Now, moving on to Coherence. The text has logical inconsistencies. The Irwadi Security Officer, Chind Ramar, is mentioned at the end, but there's a repetition of a previous dialogue segment about the Security Officer's speech, which might confuse the reader. This is a [LOGIC] problem. 

The structure is somewhat disjointed. The narrative jumps between Ramsey's perspective and the Security Officer's actions without clear transitions. For example, the part where the Security Officer is ordering the crew is introduced abruptly after describing Ramsey. This is a [STRUCTURE] issue. 

Clarity is also a concern. The phrase "A tip-sheet for the weightless races at the thing?" is unclear. The term "thing" here is ambiguous and should be replaced with the correct organization name. This is a [CLARITY] issue. 

Transitions between paragraphs are abrupt. For example, after Ramsey hands over his license, the text shifts to his personal finances without a smooth connection. This is a [TRANSITION] problem. 

Overall, while the text is mostly readable, the spelling errors, grammatical issues, and some structural problems affect both fluency and coherence. The repetition of the Security Officer's dialogue and the unclear references to "thing" are the most significant issues. Considering these points, I'll assign scores accordingly.
