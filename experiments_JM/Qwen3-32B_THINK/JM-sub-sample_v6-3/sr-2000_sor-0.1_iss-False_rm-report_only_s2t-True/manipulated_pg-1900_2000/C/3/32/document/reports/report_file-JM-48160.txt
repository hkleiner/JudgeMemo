Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Comma splice in "But the other, the Zone des Armées, in common parlance the war or military zone!" - [WORD CHOICE] Overuse of "the thing" as a vague placeholder, e.g., "the thing (the thing)"
        • Missing comma in "I have spent a good part of my life in the thing, and long since..."
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater..."
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Non-standard spelling "to-day" (modern usage is "today")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from discussing the duchess's hospital to bureaucratic processes without clear transition
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Repetition of "the thing" without consistent definition creates ambiguity
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt jump from Meaux to Verdun without contextual linkage
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Lists of cities (Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, etc.) lack explanation of selection criteria
    - [CONSISTENCY]:
        • Contradictory statements about urgency ("I broke them ruthlessly" vs. "it took so long for an application...")

Section section_02 (Chars 8217–11464):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "it is surprising there should be anything left of it" (awkward phrasing, "should" is less natural here)
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "Perhaps—also—when I was inside that Chinese wall I might persuade..." (overly complex sentence structure)
        • "not one being under five feet ten" (passive voice weakens clarity)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "the stuff had once been shelled" ("stuff" is vague and informal; unclear antecedent)
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • "he added philosophically, “it was not so bad as ‘70.”" (inconsistent quotation mark usage)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "the stuff had once been shelled" (unclear reference to "the stuff" without prior context)
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Shift from the Mayor’s anecdote to the author’s trip to the Ministère is abrupt (missing transitional phrase)
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden jump from describing soldiers’ travel classes to observing their height lacks smooth connection
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The narrative shifts between battlefield observations and administrative details without clear thematic ties
