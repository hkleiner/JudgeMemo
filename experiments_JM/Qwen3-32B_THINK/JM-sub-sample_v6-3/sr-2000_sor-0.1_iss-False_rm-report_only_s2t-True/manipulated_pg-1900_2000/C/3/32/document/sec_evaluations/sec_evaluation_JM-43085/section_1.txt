Okay, let's start evaluating this text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency: I need to look at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is a chapter from a book about Meissonier. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "in the neighbourhood of a thing, although on every side there were wide reaches..." The word "thing" here seems out of place. Maybe a typo for "town"? That's a possible spelling or word choice issue. 

Next, "Colonel the stuff, who had directed the manoeuvre." "The stuff" is likely a placeholder or typo. It should probably be a name like "Colonel the staff" or another name. That's a grammar or lexicon issue.

Another instance: "the house on the stuff." Same problem here. "Stuff" is probably a placeholder. So multiple instances of [LEXICON] issues where "stuff" is used incorrectly.

There are some awkward phrasings, like "the question of painting in France had been taking on a rather bitter tone." The phrasing is a bit stiff, but not too bad. Maybe a minor fluency issue, but not severe. 

Now, coherence: The text is about Meissonier's early life and his artistic approach. The flow seems logical, moving from an anecdote to his early years. However, the use of "the stuff" in multiple places creates confusion. Readers might get lost if they don't realize it's a placeholder. 

There's a transition from the introduction to the early years chapter. The connection is smooth, but the repeated errors in "stuff" might disrupt the flow. Also, some sentences are a bit long, but they don't hinder understanding much. 

Possible coherence issues: The abrupt shifts when "the stuff" is mentioned without context. Also, the mention of "1807" in the middle of a sentence seems out of place. It might be a misplaced number, affecting clarity. 

For coherence score, the text is mostly logical but has a few confusing parts due to the placeholder errors. Fluency-wise, the main issues are the repeated "stuff" and a few awkward phrases, but overall the text is readable. 

So, fluency score might be around 3.5 because of the multiple "stuff" errors and some awkward phrasing. Coherence could be 3.5 as well, considering the confusion from placeholders but the overall structure is coherent otherwise.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of "a thing" in "in the neighbourhood of a thing" (likely a placeholder error).  
- [LEXICON] Repetitive use of "the stuff" (e.g., "Colonel the stuff," "the house on the stuff").  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the question of painting in France had been taking on a rather bitter tone."  
- [SPELLING] Possible typo in "phalanx of David's pupils" (contextually unclear phrasing).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed references to "the stuff" without contextual clarity.  
- [CLARITY] Sudden insertion of "1807" in the middle of a sentence disrupts narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from anecdote to biographical details without smooth linkage.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of "the stuff" creates confusion between narrative and placeholder errors.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
