Let me analyze this evaluation report and determine appropriate scores for Coherence and Fluency.

First, let's look at the Fluency scores across the sections:
- Section 01: Fluency score of 3.0
- Section 02: Fluency score of 3.5

The fluency issues include:
- Spelling problems (repeated use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" instead of pronouns)
- Syntax issues (awkward adverb placement, run-on sentences, disjointed structures)
- Lexicon problems (unnatural phrasing like "come into touch")
- Grammar issues (sentence fragments)
- Possible typos

For Coherence:
- Section 01: Coherence score of 3.5
- Section 02: Coherence score of 3.0

The coherence issues include:
- Confusing references to "the stuff" and "the thing"
- Abrupt transitions between different aspects of Reynolds' life
- Unclear contextual references
- Disjointed transitions between paragraphs
- Weak connections between ideas

Looking at the recurring issues:
- Both sections show problems with unclear references and pronoun use, which affects both fluency and coherence
- Syntax and structure problems appear consistently
- Transitions between ideas are often abrupt or weak

For the Fluency score:
Both sections fall in the mid-range (3.0 to 3.5). The issues are generally noticeable but not making the text completely unreadable. There are multiple grammatical and syntactic issues that interrupt the flow, but the text is still generally readable. This suggests a score in the mid-range, likely 3.25 or 3.5.

For the Coherence score:
The scores are also in the mid-range (3.0 to 3.5). The text shows some logical progression but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. The narrative flow is disrupted by these issues, but the text is still somewhat understandable. This suggests a score in the mid-range as well, likely 3.25 or 3.5.

Based on these considerations, I would rate:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.25
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.25
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
