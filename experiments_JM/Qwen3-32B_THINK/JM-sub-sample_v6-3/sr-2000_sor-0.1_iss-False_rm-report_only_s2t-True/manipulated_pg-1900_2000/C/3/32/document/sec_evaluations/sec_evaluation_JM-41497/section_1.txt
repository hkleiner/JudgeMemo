Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user provided a chapter from a book about Joshua Reynolds. First, I need to check for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, syntax issues, and word choice.

Looking at the first paragraph, everything seems okay. The sentences flow well. Moving on, I notice some instances where the word "the stuff" is used repeatedly. Wait, "the stuff" is probably a typo for "the man" or "he," like "the stuff was born under a fortunate star" should be "he was born..." That's a spelling mistake. There are several instances of "the stuff" and "a stuff" which are likely typos. That's a problem under [SPELLING].

Also, in the sentence "He became soon a painter strong enough..." the placement of "soon" might be better as "He soon became..." which is a syntax issue. So [SYNTAX] here. 

Another example: "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." The phrase "come into touch" is a bit awkward; maybe "come into contact" is better. That's a [LEXICON] issue. 

There are also some run-on sentences. For example, "Art will not yield to inspiration alone. The musician, or the literary man, with very simple education may be able to achieve wonders..." The first sentence is a fragment if it's not part of a larger structure. But maybe that's intentional for emphasis. Still, it's a [SYNTAX] issue.

Now for coherence. The text is a chapter discussing Reynolds' life and contributions. The structure seems logical, moving from his early life to his education, travels, and influence. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the transition from discussing his early life to his apprenticeship with Hudson is smooth, but when it jumps to his meeting with Keppel, it's a bit sudden. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue. 

Also, the repeated use of "the stuff" and "a stuff" (typos) might confuse the reader, making it hard to follow the narrative. That's a [CLARITY] issue. 

There are some references to events without clear context, like "the two unfortunate accidents" in the last paragraph. Since the text is an excerpt, maybe the context is missing, but within the given text, it's not explained, leading to [LOGIC] issues. 

Another point: the author mentions "the school of Bologna was in the ascendant in the thing, and it is through Reynolds' actions rather than his words..." The word "thing" here is probably a typo for "country" or "art world," which affects clarity. [CLARITY].

Overall, the fluency has several typos and awkward phrasings, which lower the score. Coherence is mostly there but has some confusing parts due to typos and abrupt transitions.
