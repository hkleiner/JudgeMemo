  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Use of "a thing" in "in the neighbourhood of a thing" (likely a placeholder error).

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "the question of painting in France had been taking on a rather bitter tone."

  Coherence Issues:

        • Disjointed references to "the stuff" without contextual clarity.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Sudden insertion of "1807" in the middle of a sentence disrupts narrative flow.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from anecdote to biographical details without smooth linkage.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Repetition of "the stuff" creates confusion between narrative and placeholder errors.
