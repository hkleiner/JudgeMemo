Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The user wants me to look for issues in grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious grammatical errors. The text is quite long and dense with philosophical content, so there might be some complex sentences. Let me check for run-on sentences or misplaced modifiers. For example, in the first paragraph, the sentence "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave." The structure here is a bit confusing. The phrase "to the authority that appealed to my fancy" seems to be a dangling modifier or misplaced. It might be better phrased as "Believing I was breaking free of all authority except that which appealed to my fancy..." The current structure could be confusing.

Next, looking at the quote from Tyndall: "a thing it naked and you stand face to face with the notion..." The phrase "a thing it naked" is grammatically incorrect. It should probably be "a thing is naked" or "a thing stripped naked." This is a clear spelling and grammar error. The original quote might have been misattributed or miswritten here.

Another part is "the notion was not perhaps stripped too naked to preserve the decencies of modest thought." The phrase "stripped too naked" is awkward. Typically, you'd say "stripped too bare" or "stripped of its modesty." This is a word choice issue.

Looking at the sentence "I dimly suspected that the old gentleman--old in the sense of being my father's contemporary--was ignorant..." The em dashes are used correctly here, but the structure is a bit long. However, it's still readable and doesn't disrupt the flow.

In the section discussing Herbert Spencer's essay, the sentence "the same evolution of the simple into the complex, through successive differentiations, holds throughout." The use of commas here is correct. The sentence is a bit complex but grammatically sound.

There's a part where the text says "the more heterogeneous the products--inorganic, organic, and superorganic, as I learnt to call them--the stronger the evidence for the law." The em dashes are used correctly to set off the explanation. The structure is a bit long, but it's acceptable in a philosophical text.

Now, checking for spelling errors. The word "animalcular" is used, which seems like a misspelling. The correct term is "animalcule." That's a spelling error. Also, "Sartor Resartus" is a correct reference to the book by Thomas Carlyle, so that's okay. "Westminster Review" is correctly capitalized.

In the sentence "the critical doctrines of Mr. Ruskin," the use of "Mr." is appropriate here. The name "Ruskin" is correctly capitalized.

Looking at the sentence "the decomposition of every expended force into several forces has been perpetually producing a higher complication," the phrasing is a bit awkward but grammatically correct. The word "perpetually" might be replaced with "continuously" for better flow, but it's not an error.

In the quote from the third part of the essay: "The sincere man of science, content to follow wherever the evidence leads him becomes by each new enquiry more profoundly convinced..." The comma before "content" is missing, making it a comma splice. It should be "content to follow wherever the evidence leads him, becomes..." This is a punctuation error.

Another part: "In all directions his investigations bring him face to face with the unknowable; and he ever more clearly perceives it to be the unknowable." The semicolon is correctly used here to join two independent clauses. The repetition of "unknowable" is intentional for emphasis, so it's acceptable.

Now, checking for syntax issues. The sentence structure in most parts is complex but correct. However, some sentences are quite long and might be harder to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "If then differentiation be the cardinal law of evolution--for the correlative concept of integration receives no emphasis in this early essay--does not the universality of the law imply a universal cause?" The structure is a bit convoluted, but it's a rhetorical question and acceptable in the context of philosophical writing.

Overall, there are a few grammatical issues and awkward phrasings, but the text is generally fluent. The main problems are in the incorrect phrase "a thing it naked" and the misspelled "animalcular." There are also some minor punctuation issues and awkward word choices. These issues don't severely disrupt the readability, so the fluency score is likely a 4 or 4.5.

Moving on to coherence. Coherence refers to how well the ideas flow and connect logically. The text is a philosophical discussion of Spencer's work, so the structure should present ideas in a logical sequence. Let's check for abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.

The text starts with the author's personal experience of reading Tyndall's work, then moves to a discussion of evolution and Spencer's philosophy. The transition from the personal anecdote to the philosophical discussion is smooth. The use of quotes and references to specific works (like Sartor Resartus) is appropriate and adds depth.

However, in the section discussing the law of differentiation, the sentence "the more heterogeneous the products--inorganic, organic, and superorganic, as I learnt to call them--the stronger the evidence for the law." The explanation here is a bit abrupt and might confuse readers unfamiliar with the terms. The term "superoorganic" is a specific term from Spencer's work, so it's contextually appropriate, but the transition to discussing these categories could be smoother.

Another part is the discussion of the "unknowable" and the ultimate mystery remaining. The text moves from discussing the law of differentiation to the philosophical implications of the unknowable. This transition is logical but could be clearer. The shift from scientific explanation to philosophical uncertainty is handled well, but the connection between the two ideas might not be immediately obvious to all readers.

The text also references various experts' opinions (Darwin, William James) to support Spencer's contributions. These references are integrated into the narrative and support the argument, so they contribute to coherence.

There's a section where the author discusses Spencer's "narrowness of intent and vastness of extent." The contrast between these two aspects is presented clearly, but the transition from discussing his contributions to his limitations could be smoother. The text moves from praising his work to pointing out his rigid approach, which is logical but could use a clearer transition.

In the final paragraphs, the author summarizes Spencer's legacy and his impact on various fields. The flow here is logical, but the sheer volume of information might make some parts feel dense. The use of em dashes and complex sentences could make the text feel a bit fragmented in places.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, with ideas presented in a logical sequence. There are a few points where the transitions could be smoother or where the connection between ideas is not immediately clear, but these don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding. The coherence score is likely a 4 or 4.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "a thing it naked" (incorrect phrase; should be "a thing is naked" or "stripped naked")  
- [SPELLING] "animalcular" (misspelled; should be "animalcule")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "Believing that I was independently breaking free of all authority, to the authority that appealed to my fancy..." (dangling modifier)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma in "The sincere man of science, content to follow wherever the evidence leads him becomes..." (comma splice)  
- [LEXICON] "stripped too naked" (awkward word choice; "stripped too bare" is more natural)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from personal anecdote to abstract philosophical discussion without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] Abrupt introduction of "superoorganic" without prior explanation  
- [LOGIC] Jump from scientific explanation of differentiation to philosophical "unknowable" lacks explicit connection  
- [TRANSITION] Transition from praising Spencer's work to criticizing his "rigidity" is abrupt  
- [STRUCTURE] Dense clusters of complex sentences in final paragraphs may overwhelm readers  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
