        • Complex sentence structure in "When the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that he had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila..." - [WORD CHOICE] "if we give credence to the city's history" is wordy
        • Awkward passive voice in "At short intervals... stood in its center a line..."
