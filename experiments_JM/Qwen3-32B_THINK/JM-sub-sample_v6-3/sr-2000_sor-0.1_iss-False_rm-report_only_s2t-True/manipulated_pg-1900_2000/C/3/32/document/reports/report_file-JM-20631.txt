Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "Hebrew is one example among many of a language outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech" (word order disrupts clarity).
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Repetition of "a thing" (e.g., "in a thing to-day," "at a thing and Berlin") suggests placeholder errors or missing context.
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Misplaced commas in complex sentences (e.g., "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds...").
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Inconsistent use of em dashes and semicolons in quotes and parentheticals (e.g., "The proposition contains just that dash of truth which is more dangerous than falsehood undiluted;").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transitions between historical examples of ritual languages (Welsh, Slav, Buddhist) without clear thematic linkage.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear references to "a thing" disrupt logical flow and reader comprehension.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from Arthur Davis’s biography to abstract discussions of language revival lacks smooth bridging.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Jarring juxtaposition of Germanism/Jewish comparisons with Deuteronomy’s violent passages without contextual explanation.

Section section_02 (Chars 8710–12364):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 3.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Repeated use of "a thing" without clear meaning
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, run-on sentences with missing punctuation (e.g., "The prophet Isaiah pictures the wealth of nations...")
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous antecedents (e.g., "the thing is also to be all-righteous")
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Zion" vs. "Zion" in same context)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Awkward phrasing in religious references (e.g., "The thing shalt suck the milk of nations")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shifts between historical examples (e.g., from biblical figures to modern figures like Vehaeren)
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Disconnected ideas between sections (e.g., sudden shift from "chosen people" to Maimonides' "Guide to the Perplexed")
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Unclear progression between paragraphs (e.g., moving from "Chosen People" to "Life alone that can give us the clue")
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Repetition of "a thing" without resolution creates confusion
    - [CONTEXT]:
        • References to external texts (e.g., "Passover Seder Service") lack sufficient explanation for standalone comprehension
