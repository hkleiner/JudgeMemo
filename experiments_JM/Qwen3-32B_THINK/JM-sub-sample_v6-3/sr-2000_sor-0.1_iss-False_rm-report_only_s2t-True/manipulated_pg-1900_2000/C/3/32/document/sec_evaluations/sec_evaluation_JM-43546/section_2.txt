Let me analyze the provided text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Issues

I'll go through the text to identify any grammatical, syntactic, or phrasing issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "He had gone to a thing when he was a young lad" - This is grammatically incorrect and confusing. "A thing" doesn't refer to anything specific in the context.

2. [GRAMMAR] "He wanted to enjoy it in the stuff, his own country" - This sentence is grammatically confusing. The phrase "in the stuff" doesn't make sense in this context.

3. [GRAMMAR] "as a lake is called in a thing" - Again, "in a thing" is used incorrectly here.

4. [GRAMMAR] "To Donald it seemed a palace, and he did not think the king himself had anything so grand" - This sentence has a grammatical issue with the verb tense and structure.

5. [SPELLING] "cousins are coming to make us a visit first" - This is awkward phrasing. A more natural expression would be "cousins are coming to visit us first."

6. [GRAMMAR] "He had made a great fortune in copper mines" - This sentence is missing a preposition that would clarify the relationship between the fortune and the mines.

7. [GRAMMAR] "The boys were soon whispering together in a corner" - This is grammatically correct but the phrase "in a corner" is vague without context.

8. [GRAMMAR] "He had gone to a thing when he was a young lad" - This is repeated and remains confusing.

9. [GRAMMAR] "He wanted to enjoy it in the stuff, his own country" - This is repeated and remains confusing.

10. [GRAMMAR] "as a lake is called in a thing" - This is repeated and remains confusing.

11. [GRAMMAR] "with big buildings so tall that they seemed like many houses piled one on top of another" - This is awkward phrasing.

12. [GRAMMAR] "There were several clear streams and a loch, as a lake is called in a thing" - This is repeated and remains confusing.

13. [GRAMMAR] "The whole family talked the matter over a long time" - This is awkward phrasing.

14. [GRAMMAR] "The puppy's name was in time shortened to Rob" - This is awkward phrasing.

## Coherence Issues

Now I'll analyze for coherence problems:

1. [LOGIC] The repeated use of "a thing" without clear meaning disrupts the logical flow of the text. These phrases appear multiple times without any clear explanation or context.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions. For example, it moves from discussing Donald's excitement about his cousins to describing Uncle Alan's estate, then to the story of finding the puppy, with little connection between these different narrative threads.

3. [LOGIC] The narrative seems to jump in time without clear markers. It moves from the current excitement about the cousins visiting to past events about finding a puppy, without clear temporal connections.

4. [CLARITY] The repeated use of "a thing" without explanation makes the text confusing and difficult to follow.

5. [TRANSITION] The text lacks smooth transitions between different sections, making the narrative feel disjointed.

6. [LOGIC] The text mentions "Kelvin House" as the Gordons' home in Edinburgh but doesn't clearly explain its relationship to the other locations mentioned (like Skylemore in the Highlands).

7. [STRUCTURE] The text moves from discussing Donald's excitement about his cousins to his uncle's adventures in America, then to the story of finding the puppy, creating a disjointed narrative flow.

Based on these issues, I'll now assign scores:

For Fluency: The text has multiple grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but it's generally readable. The most serious problems are the repeated use of "a thing" without explanation, which appears multiple times and significantly affects understanding. I would rate this a 2.5 on the fluency scale.

For Coherence: The text has significant issues with logical flow, transitions, and clarity. The repeated use of "a thing" and the disjointed narrative structure make it difficult to follow the story. The text jumps between different topics without clear connections. I would rate this a 2 on the coherence scale.
