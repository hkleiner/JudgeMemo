Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove."
- [PUNCTUATION] Unclear punctuation in "The stuff, across the street, is a four-page tabloid."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "This is the early Eighties."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Small towns such as Ishpeming are 'easy pickings' for traveling fakers."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Their advance is always heralded by the exchanges."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "They clean up at the expense of local merchants."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "All editors warn them to keep away."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "It is nearly nine o'clock on a Friday night--'make-up' time."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Mr. Newett has written his last sheets of copy and is reading proof."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "At the corner of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is selling soap."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "In one wrapper he pretends to place a five dollar bill--a version of the 'old army game.'"
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "He is standing in a market wagon and has a companion who strums a guitar and sings."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Attached to an upright and above his head is a kerosene flare."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after introductory phrase "Mr. Newett walks leisurely to where there are several guns and fishing rods in a corner."

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the narrator's work experiences to the description of a soap salesman across the street without clear transition.
- [LOGIC] The description of the soap salesman seems disconnected from the rest of the narrative about the narrator's work experiences.
- [LOGIC] The text ends with Mr. Newett walking to where there are guns and fishing rods, but there's no indication of what happens next or how this connects to the rest of the story.
- [LOGIC] The mention of "the Iron Ore job printer" leaving without clear explanation of who replaces them or what happens to the newspaper business.
- [LOGIC] The timeline of the narrator's age and wages is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner.
- [LOGIC] The text references "the Iron Ore job printer" and then later refers to "a stuff" without clear identification of these entities.
- [LOGIC] The transition from the narrator working at the print shop to Mr. Newett walking to guns and fishing rods is abrupt and unexplained.

Now let me assign scores:

For Fluency:
The text has several punctuation issues that affect readability, but the overall structure and grammar are mostly correct. The issues are primarily minor punctuation errors rather than major grammatical problems. I would rate this as a 4 - mostly fluent with some minor punctuation issues.

For Coherence:
The text has some logical jumps and disconnected segments, particularly at the end where it abruptly shifts to describing the soap salesman across the street without clear transition or resolution. There are also some confusing references to entities without clear identification. The overall narrative is generally coherent, but there are noticeable logical issues that affect the flow. I would rate this as a 3.5 - generally coherent but with noticeable logical jumps and disconnected segments.

Let me double check my analysis:

Fluency: I identified mostly punctuation issues that don't severely impact comprehension, but do affect the flow. The grammar and syntax are mostly correct. This supports a 4 rating.

Coherence: The text has logical jumps, particularly at the end, and some confusing references. While the narrative is generally understandable, the issues with logical flow and transitions are noticeable. This supports a 3.5 rating.
