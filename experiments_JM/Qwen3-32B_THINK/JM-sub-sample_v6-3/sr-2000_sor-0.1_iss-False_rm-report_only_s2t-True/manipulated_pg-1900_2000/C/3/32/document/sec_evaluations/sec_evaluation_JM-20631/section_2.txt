Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section. First, I need to go through the text and spot any issues.

Starting with fluency. The text is quite dense with historical and religious references. I notice some phrases that might be awkward. For example, "The thing shalt suck the milk of nations." The word "thing" here seems out of place. Maybe it's a typo or a placeholder. Also, "a thing" is repeated multiple times, which is confusing. That's probably a [SPELLING] or [LEXICON] issue. There are some run-on sentences and missing commas. Like the long sentence after "The prophet Isaiah pictures..." which could use a semicolon or period for clarity. That's a [SYNTAX] problem. Also, "the thing is also to be all-righteous" has an unclear antecedent. Maybe "the thing" refers to a nation or people, but it's not clear. That's a [CLARITY] issue.

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different historical figures and passages without clear transitions. For example, moving from David and Judas Maccabaeus to modern examples like Vehaeren and Maeterlinck feels abrupt. That's a [TRANSITION] problem. The structure is a bit disjointed; it starts with biblical examples, then shifts to modern times, then back to interpretation. The flow isn't smooth. Also, the mention of "a thing" repeatedly without explanation makes the text confusing. That affects [LOGIC] and [STRUCTURE]. The argument seems to be about the Bible's portrayal of chosen people and its implications, but the connections between the examples aren't always clear. There's a reference to Maimonides and a mention of a "Guide to the Perplexed," but it's not well-integrated into the main argument. That's another [STRUCTURE] issue.

Putting it all together. For fluency, the main problems are the repeated "a thing," awkward phrasing, and some missing punctuation. These issues make the text a bit hard to follow but not completely unintelligible. So maybe a 3.5? Coherence has more significant issues with transitions and structure, making the overall flow confusing. The repeated "a thing" also disrupts coherence. So coherence might be a 3 or 3.5. Wait, the scale for coherence: if there are noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions, that's a 3. The text does have those, so maybe a 3. Fluency, with the repeated errors but still readable, could be a 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Repeated use of "a thing" without clear meaning  
- [SYNTAX] Long, run-on sentences with missing punctuation (e.g., "The prophet Isaiah pictures the wealth of nations...")  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous antecedents (e.g., "the thing is also to be all-righteous")  
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Zion" vs. "Zion" in same context)  
- [STRUCTURE] Awkward phrasing in religious references (e.g., "The thing shalt suck the milk of nations")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shifts between historical examples (e.g., from biblical figures to modern figures like Vehaeren)  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected ideas between sections (e.g., sudden shift from "chosen people" to Maimonides' "Guide to the Perplexed")  
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear progression between paragraphs (e.g., moving from "Chosen People" to "Life alone that can give us the clue")  
- [CLARITY] Repetition of "a thing" without resolution creates confusion  
- [CONTEXT] References to external texts (e.g., "Passover Seder Service") lack sufficient explanation for standalone comprehension  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
