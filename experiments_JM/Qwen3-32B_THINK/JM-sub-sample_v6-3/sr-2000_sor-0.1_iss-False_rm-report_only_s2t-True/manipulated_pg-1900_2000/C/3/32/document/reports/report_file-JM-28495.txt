Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "Bettersea trem?" likely a typo (e.g., "tem" vs. "trem")
        • "stuff Chief" and "stuff's Pride" (likely "Celtic Chief" and "Scotia's Pride")
        • "the thing terriers" (likely "that terriers")
        • "the thing on a hot day" (likely "city" or "place")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from the conductor’s announcement to the boy’s cryptic advice ("bite a policeman") feels abrupt but is narratively intentional.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The transition from following the man in uniform to entering a pub lacks smooth connection, though contextually acceptable in the narrative.

  - Coherence: 5.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:

  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Shift from the chase to the walking-home scene lacks explicit temporal marker, creating a minor disconnect.
