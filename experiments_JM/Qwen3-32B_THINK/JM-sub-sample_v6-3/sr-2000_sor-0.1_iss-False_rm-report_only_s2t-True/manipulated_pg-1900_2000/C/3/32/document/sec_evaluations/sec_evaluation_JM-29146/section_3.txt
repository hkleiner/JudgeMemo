Let me carefully evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Evaluation:

First, I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and phrasing issues:

1. [GRAMMAR] "They have got the planetarization bug, and they've got it bad." - The phrasing is awkward with the double "got" and the informal "bad" at the end.

2. [PUNCTUATION] "Sally Englander called from the kitchen of the small flat: "Will Jase be staying for supper?" - The colon after "flat" is correct, but the punctuation overall is fine.

3. [GRAMMAR] "Englander stared at Ramsey, who shook his head. "Not today, Sally"," - The comma splice is incorrect.

4. [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey said, looking at Ramsey gratefully." - The name "Ramsey" is repeated unnecessarily.

5. [GRAMMAR] "So I've got a few hundred credits just burning a hole in my pocket," - The phrasing is natural but slightly informal.

6. [GRAMMAR] "But the Irwadians are keeping us right here." - The phrasing is correct.

7. [GRAMMAR] "Sure, but it won't last. Not when the folks back in Capella and Deneb and Sol System hear about it." - The phrasing is correct.

8. [GRAMMAR] "It'll take at least that long." - The phrasing is correct.

9. [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey gave him three hundred and seventy-five credits and said: "Just see you make that go a long way supporting Sally and the kids." - The phrasing is correct.

10. [GRAMMAR] "He'll knock your block off if I see you there." - The idiom "knock your block off" is a bit dated but grammatically correct.

11. [GRAMMAR] "I'll knock my own block off if I see me there." - The pronoun "me" should be "myself" for grammatical correctness.

12. [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey gave him three hundred and seventy-five credits" - The phrasing is correct.

13. [GRAMMAR] "He felt good about what he'd done." - The phrasing is correct.

14. [GRAMMAR] "He had only three credits left." - The phrasing is correct.

15. [GRAMMAR] "You owe that fish-eyed, scale-skinned Irwadian landlady the rent money" - The phrasing is correct.

16. [GRAMMAR] "He watched the gambling for another hour or so without risking his few remaining credits." - The phrasing is correct.

17. [GRAMMAR] "I'm sorry," Ramsey said. "Were you talking to me?" - The dialogue punctuation is correct.

18. [GRAMMAR] "I thertainly wath," lisped the Irwadian, his eyes blazing with drunken hatred. - This is an intentional mispronunciation to show the character's speech pattern, not an error.

19. [GRAMMAR] "Go ahead and tell me--" with a little smile--"you think it was my idea." - The em dashes are used correctly for the dialogue interruption.

20. [GRAMMAR] "The Irwadian looked up haughtily. Evidently he was looking for trouble, or could not hold his liquor, or both." - The phrasing is correct.

21. [GRAMMAR] "He studied the drunken Irwadian carefully." - The phrasing is correct.

22. [GRAMMAR] "In all the time he'd spent on Irwadi, he'd never been able to tell a native's age by his green, scale-skinned, fish-eyed poker-face." - The phrasing is correct.

23. [GRAMMAR] "But the glossy green scales covering face and body told Ramsey, along with the sturdy muscles revealed by the lack of clothing, that the Irwadian was in his prime," - The phrasing is correct.

24. [GRAMMAR] "You outworlderth have been deprething the thandard of living on Irwadi ever thince you came here," the Irwadian said. - This is an intentional mispronunciation to show the character's speech pattern, not an error.

25. [GRAMMAR] "All you ever brought wath poverty and your ditheath germth and more trouble than you could handle." - This is an intentional mispronunciation to show the character's speech pattern, not an error.

26. [GRAMMAR] "I don't want your thtink near me. I'm trying to enjoy mythelf." - This is an intentional mispronunciation to show the character's speech pattern, not an error.

27. [GRAMMAR] "It was abruptly silent in the little gambling hall." - The phrasing is correct.

28. [GRAMMAR] "The silence, Ramsey thought, should have been both ominous and in his favor." - The phrasing is correct.

29. [GRAMMAR] "Outworlders, yes. But not another Earthman present." - The phrasing is correct.

Based on these observations, I would rate the fluency as a 4. The text is mostly fluent with only a few minor grammatical issues (the comma splice and the pronoun error). The intentional mispronunciations are not errors but stylistic choices to show the character's speech patterns. The text flows naturally and is generally easy to read.

## Coherence Evaluation:

Now, I'll look at how the text progresses logically and how ideas connect:

1. [LOGIC] The transition from Englander's financial situation to the gambling scene is abrupt. The text moves from Englander receiving money to Ramsey going to the gambling hall with very little connection between these events.

2. [LOGIC] The transition from the gambling hall to the Irwadian character is also somewhat abrupt. The text moves from Ramsey watching the gambling to an interaction with a specific Irwadian with little setup.

3. [LOGIC] The transition from the Irwadian's drunken outburst to the description of Irwadian physical characteristics is a bit disjointed. The text moves from the Irwadian's words to a description of his appearance without clear transition.

4. [LOGIC] The transition from the Irwadian's outburst to the broader observation about Irwadian society is also somewhat abrupt.

5. [LOGIC] The text ends with Ramsey's thoughts about the Irwadian and his situation, but there's no clear resolution or connection back to the earlier part about Englander.

6. [LOGIC] The concept of "planetarization" is introduced but not clearly explained, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.

7. [LOGIC] The term "outworlder" is used frequently but is not defined, which might be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the context.

8. [LOGIC] The setting is not clearly established at the beginning of the text. The reader is dropped into the middle of a conversation without much context.

9. [LOGIC] The political and social situation on Irwadi is mentioned but not clearly explained, which might leave some readers confused.

10. [LOGIC] The text jumps between different locations and situations without always providing clear transitions.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5. The text is generally coherent and follows a logical progression, but there are some noticeable abrupt transitions and jumps between ideas. The setting and some key concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation, which could make the text a bit confusing for some readers. However, the narrative does maintain a clear focus on Ramsey's actions and interactions throughout the text.

So, my final ratings would be:
- Fluency: 4
- Coherence: 3.5
