Let me carefully evaluate the current section of the text based on the provided criteria.

First, I'll analyze the text for fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, and word choice):

1) Fluency Issues:

- [GRAMMAR] "The sun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has arrived for him to call together his flock..." - This is grammatically correct.

I don't see any significant grammatical errors in the text. The sentence structure is generally clear and well-formed.

Now let's check for coherence issues:

1) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure, beginning with an analysis of Millet's artistic restraint and moving to discuss his philosophical nature and focus on peasant life.
- [LOGIC] The logical flow is generally good, with the text moving from one idea to the next in a reasonable sequence.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, with the text moving from one concept to another in a logical manner.
- [CLARITY] The meaning is clear throughout the text.
- [CONSISTENCY] The text maintains a consistent focus on Millet's artistic philosophy and his depiction of peasant life.
- [CONTEXT] The text builds upon the previous section's discussion of Millet's restrained painting style.

I don't see any significant coherence issues in the text. The ideas flow logically and are well-connected.

Based on my analysis:
- Fluency Score: 5 (Highly fluent, with clear, natural phrasing and minimal to no grammatical issues)
- Coherence Score: 5 (Highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout)

The text is well-written, with clear and grammatically correct sentences, and the ideas flow logically and coherently.
