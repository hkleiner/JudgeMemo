Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the provided text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. 

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure seems a bit complex but not necessarily incorrect. However, there are some instances where the phrasing is a bit convoluted. For example, "the worthy mercer a stuff" might be a typo or missing a word, possibly "a stuff" is meant to be "a stuff merchant" or similar. That's a bit confusing. 

Next, in the sentence "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet to the high promenades of the thing--as the worthy mercer was first in all the little town to know by his modest traffic in them; and that, too, only long after the things they shadowed were buried under new millineries and fopperies and fantastic riot in the gay capital." The use of "thing" here is unclear and seems like a placeholder, which is a problem. 

Moving on, there are several instances where "the thing" or "a thing" is used without clear antecedents. For example, "Boucher, turning his back upon academic art on gaining his seat at the thing, was creating the thing, a thing-pieces, and Cupid-pieces..." This repetition of "thing" without context is confusing. 

There are also some missing words or incorrect word choices. For instance, "the stuff had small genius for the mighty business" â€“ "stuff" here seems out of place and likely a placeholder. Similarly, "the historic and noble house of the thing" again uses "thing" inappropriately. 

The sentence structure in some parts is quite long and could be broken down for clarity. For example, the sentence about the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle is very long and might be difficult to follow. 

In terms of spelling, I don't notice any obvious misspellings, but the use of "pleasaunces" is archaic and might be a typo for "pleasures" or "pleasures." However, if it's intentional for stylistic effect, it might not be an error. 

Overall, there are several instances of awkward phrasing, missing words, and unclear references that affect the fluency. These issues make the text harder to read and understand, which would lower the fluency score. However, the rest of the text is generally well-written with clear sentences and good flow. 

Now, for coherence. The text is a historical narrative about Fragonard and the cultural context of his time. The main issue is the frequent use of "the thing" and "a thing" without clear antecedents. These placeholders disrupt the logical flow and make it difficult to follow the intended meaning. 

There are also some abrupt shifts in topic, such as moving from the description of Grasse to the political events involving Louis XV and the Pompadour without smooth transitions. However, given that this is a section of a larger text, some context might be missing from the excerpt. 

The narrative does maintain a general progression from Fragonard's birth to his early life and the cultural milieu, but the unclear references and some disjointed sentences affect coherence. 

The structure is mostly chronological, which helps with coherence, but the placeholder words and some confusing transitions create issues. 

Considering the evaluation criteria, the fluency issues are significant but not overwhelming, and the coherence is somewhat affected by the unclear references and transitions. I need to assign scores based on the scale provided, using half-points if necessary.
