Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in the text. The first thing I notice is some grammatical errors. For example, the sentence "In memory the fragrant perfume of the la thing roses at the end of the walk drifted out to her again" has a misplaced phrase. The phrase "In memory" is a bit awkward here and might be better placed differently. Also, "la thing roses" seems like a typo; it should probably be "laughing" or "laughing thing," but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a mistranslation or a typo for "laughing" or another word. 

Next, there's a sentence fragment: "asking the stuff to come and sit in the arbor and talk with her." The phrase "asking the stuff to come" is unclear. "Stuff" is a vague term here; it should specify who or what is being asked. It might be a typo for "asking her to come" or "asking the students to come." 

Looking at the sentence structure, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, "Kuei Ping had stood first in her class and when the exercises were over she had stolen away into the garden to bid it a last farewell, with the small remembrance reward that had been given to her clasped in her hand." This is a run-on sentence with multiple clauses that could be broken down for better clarity. 

There's also a possible punctuation issue in the sentence about Miss Porter. The phrase "asking the stuff to come and sit in the arbor and talk with her" could use a comma after "asking" to separate the clauses properly. 

Moving on to coherence, the text transitions between different memories and events. The flow from Kuei Ping's graduation day to her family's plans for her marriage is abrupt. There's a sudden shift from her time in school to the engagement gifts and her grandmother's plans, which might leave the reader confused about the timeline. 

The mention of "the engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress" is a bit confusing. The connection between these items and her current situation isn't clearly established, making the transition feel disjointed. 

The final part about Madame Yen and the chair-bearers seems to wrap up the scene, but the transition from the internal conflict of Kuei Ping to the external actions of the characters is abrupt. It might be helpful to have a smoother transition to show how the internal and external events are connected. 

There are also some unclear references, like "the latter had been a trifle curt." The "latter" refers to Miss Porter's response, but it's not immediately clear what "the latter" is referring to without more context. This could cause confusion for the reader. 

Overall, the text has some grammatical and structural issues that affect fluency, and the transitions between different parts of the story could be smoother to improve coherence. However, the story itself is engaging and the ideas are present, so the scores might be in the mid-range for both fluency and coherence.
