Alright, I'm going to analyze the text provided for fluency and coherence issues, then assign scores based on the criteria given.

First, I'll examine the text for fluency issues:

1. Grammatical issues: I notice some potential problems with subject-verb agreement and verb forms.
2. Word choice: There are some awkward or unclear word choices.
3. Punctuation: The text has some questionable punctuation usage.
4. Syntax: Some sentences have complex or unclear structure.

Now, I'll examine the text for coherence issues:

1. Logical flow: I'll check if the ideas flow logically from one to the next.
2. Transitions: I'll look for smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas.
3. Consistency: I'll check if the text maintains a consistent focus and perspective.
4. Clarity of progression: I'll evaluate if the narrative has a clear progression.

Let me now go through the text in detail to identify specific issues:

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Nothing being known of the life of this king as heir-apparent, probably we shall never understand what led him to take this new departure." - This construction is awkward and could be clearer.
- [GRAMMAR] "From his conduct during the early years of his reign it may be concluded that he intended to proceed gradually, but was roused to more aggressive measures by the resistance of the powerful priests of Amon in the thing." - The phrase "in the thing" is unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] "The king altered his throne-name, “Amen-hetep,” to “Akhen-Aten,” “The glory of the Sun’s Disk”; his young daughters received names compounded with “Aten,” whilst the courtiers found it advisable to strike out “Amen,” if this chanced to form part of their own names, and to substitute for it “Ra,” as having more or less the same significance as “Aten.”" - This sentence is very long and complex, with multiple clauses that make it difficult to follow.
- [GRAMMAR] "The officials of a thing and the stuff—all foreigners—do not seem to have received any formal information regarding it." - The terms "a thing" and "the stuff" are unclear and confusing.
- [GRAMMAR] "A stuff apparently even tried to give himself out as one initiated into “the doctrine,” and to represent his city as a servant of Aten." - The use of "a stuff" is confusing and unclear.
- [GRAMMAR] "This Haya, who was entitled “beloved royal scribe,” was probably a secretary of state, and was once sent as a special ambassador to Babylonia." - The sentence structure is a bit awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "An official named the stuff receives instruction as to the conducting of a royal caravan." - The use of "the stuff" is confusing and unclear.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions, such as from the religious reform to specific officials.
- [LOGIC] The repeated use of "a thing" and "the stuff" without clear definitions creates confusion.
- [LOGIC] The text sometimes shifts between discussing the religious reform and the political implications without clear connections.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions several officials but doesn't clearly explain their roles or significance in the context of the reform.
- [LOGIC] The narrative occasionally shifts focus without clear indication of the relationship between different sections.

Based on my analysis:

For Fluency:
The text has multiple grammatical issues, awkward phrasing, and confusing terminology. While it's generally readable, the issues are frequent enough to impact the flow and clarity of the text. I would rate this as a 3 on the fluency scale - generally readable but with multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow.

For Coherence:
The text has some logical flow and covers a clear topic, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections between different parts. The repeated use of undefined terms like "a thing" and "the stuff" creates confusion. The text sometimes jumps between different aspects of the reform without clear transitions. I would rate this as a 3 on the coherence scale - generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments.

Let me finalize my assessment:

Fluency Score: 3
Coherence Score: 3

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward construction in "Nothing being known of the life of this king as heir-apparent, probably we shall never understand..."
