Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current segment. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with syntax and word choice.

Looking at the sentence: "Our underclothing could be drawn on only with difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling added no little to the discomfort of the situation." The phrase "added no little to the discomfort" is a bit archaic or awkward. It might be clearer to say "added significantly to the discomfort." That's a minor issue in phrasing.

Next, the sentence: "When the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that he had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled it after the mediaeval towns of his European home." The structure here is a bit long and complex. The phrase "riches of these distant islands that he had named for his King Philip" is a bit convoluted. It might be clearer to split into two sentences or rephrase for smoother flow. This is a minor syntax issue.

The sentence: "And it is well that he did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early life was not one of undisturbed quiet." The phrase "if we give credence to the city's history" is a bit wordy. It could be more concise, like "if we believe the city's history." This is a minor issue in word choice.

The sentence: "Not to mention the sea-rovers of those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town, legend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate occasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern islands." The transition "Not to mention" is a bit abrupt and doesn't smoothly connect to the previous sentence. This is a minor transition issue.

The sentence: "So Manila consists of two parts, the city 'intra muros' and the new city which has sprung up around it." The use of "So" at the beginning of the sentence is a bit abrupt. It might be better to rephrase for smoother transition. This is a minor transition issue.

The sentence: "The strokes of eight o'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia when I purposely took this station that I might see the current of Manila's life when flowing at its height." The phrase "pealing forth" is a bit archaic or awkward. "Pealing" is not commonly used in modern English. "Pealing forth" is redundant. It could be simplified to "pealed." This is a minor word choice issue.

The sentence: "At short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its center a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki uniforms and russet leather leggins." The structure is a bit awkward. The sentence is written in the passive voice, which might be better in active voice. This is a minor syntax issue.

The sentence: "Between the two lines of pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and carts." The structure is a bit awkward. It might be clearer to say "Two lines of vehicles and carts moved in opposite directions between the two lines of pedestrians." This is a minor syntax issue.

The sentence: "There were English bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants, foreign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen from foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and conditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting along with burdens swung over their shoulders." The list is very long and could be more concise. The phrase "from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies" is a bit awkward. This is a minor syntax issue.

The sentence: "There were Japanese, and East India merchants from the stuff and Calcutta, and, finally, all classes and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the seventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this wonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities." The phrase "from the stuff" is unclear. It likely means "from the stuff" as in "from the stuff of India" or "from the region of India," but the phrasing is awkward. The punctuation with a comma before the dash is also incorrect. This is a minor word choice and punctuation issue.

The sentence: "All of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment to our stations." The sentence is clear and well-structured.

The sentence: "One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one morning about the end of the second week to find the following notice posted throughout all our quarters:" The phrase "on awaking" is a bit awkward. It would be better to say "upon awakening" or "when we awoke." This is a minor word choice issue.

Overall, the text has a few minor issues with phrasing, word choice, and syntax, but these do not significantly disrupt the overall readability. The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that are noticeable but do not hinder understanding.

Now, let's evaluate the coherence of the current segment. Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole, with important criteria being logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

The current segment starts with a description of the discomfort of the narrator due to wet clothing. Then it transitions to a historical account of Manila's founding by a Spaniard and its early life. This transition is a bit abrupt as it jumps from a personal experience to a historical narrative without a clear connection. This is a minor transition issue.

The segment then discusses the structure of Manila (intra muros and the new city) and transitions to the narrator's experience on the morning following their landing, describing the old stone bridge and the surrounding activity. This transition is smooth as it's a natural progression from discussing the city's structure to the narrator's experience in the city.

The description of the bridge and the people on it is well-sequenced and provides a clear picture of the city's cosmopolitan nature. The transition to the river and the activity below the bridge is also smooth.

The segment ends with the narrator's experience of waiting in Manila for two weeks and the discovery of a notice. This is a logical progression from the description of the city to the narrator's personal experience within it.

There are a few minor issues with transitions, but the overall narrative flows logically and the ideas are well-structured. The text provides a clear and logical progression from one idea to the next, with only a few minor abrupt shifts.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a few minor issues in transitions, but these do not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the text.

Based on these evaluations, I would rate the fluency as a 4 and the coherence as a 4 as well.
