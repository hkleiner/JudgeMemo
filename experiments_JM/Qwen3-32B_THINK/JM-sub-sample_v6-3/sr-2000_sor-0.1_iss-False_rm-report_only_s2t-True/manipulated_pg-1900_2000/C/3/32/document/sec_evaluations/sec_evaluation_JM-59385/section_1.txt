Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in the text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing.

First, I notice that the text has a somewhat archaic or formal tone. While this could be intentional for the style, there are instances where the phrasing feels a bit awkward. For example, the sentence "To the women of America I dedicate this story of the life of my Chinese friend and teacher: it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it." This is a long sentence with a complex structure that might be difficult to follow. The use of "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it" is a bit convoluted.

There are also some instances of passive voice that might affect the flow. For example, "Kuei Ping sat passively quiet as her chair-bearers turned into the street at a low spoken word from her grandmother." The passive construction here could be made more direct for clarity.

Looking at the punctuation, there are some places where the punctuation could be improved. For instance, the sentence "But I have found, for I like to visit the little shops on side streets, that the more precious jewels glow with a warmer brilliancy when the day outside is dark." The use of commas here is correct, but the sentence is quite long and could be broken into shorter sentences for better readability.

There are also some minor spelling errors or inconsistencies. For example, "Lend light, lend light" is repeated, and while it might be intentional for effect, it's a bit jarring. Also, "swaying tapestried box-like chairs" has a compound adjective that might be better separated for clarity.

In terms of coherence, the text is generally well-structured and follows a logical progression. The narrative moves from the introduction of the Street of Precious Pearls to the description of Kuei Ping's visit to the shop. The transition from the description of the shop to the bargaining process is smooth, and the characters are introduced in a clear manner.

However, there is a sudden shift in the final paragraph where the narrative jumps from the shop to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school. This transition is abrupt and might be confusing for the reader. The connection between the two scenes is not immediately clear, and it might benefit from a smoother transition or more context to explain why she is thinking about the mission school at this point.

Overall, the text is well-written with a strong narrative flow, but there are a few areas where the fluency could be improved, and the final transition could be smoother for better coherence.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures (e.g., long sentences with multiple clauses)
- [STYLE] Archaic/awkward phrasing (e.g., "it is as accurate as she with her small store of English words, and I with my limited knowledge of her language could make it")
- [PASSIVE VOICE] Excessive passive constructions (e.g., "Kuei Ping sat passively quiet")
- [PUNCTUATION] Cumbersome punctuation in long sentences (e.g., "But I have found, for I like to visit...")

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt narrative jump from jewelry shop to mission school memory with no transitional context
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift in focus from the dowry scene to unrelated memory without clear connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear motivation for Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school in this context

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
