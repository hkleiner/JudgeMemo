Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency issues in the text. First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "Helsingfors" is the chapter title, but it's not clear if that's intentional or a typo. Then, there's "ol which" instead of "of which" in the sentence about the Nan-shan mountains. That's a spelling mistake. Another one is "a thing and India" which should probably be "a thing and India" but it's unclear what "a thing" refers to here, maybe a typo for a place name. There's also "stuff" used multiple times where specific names should be, like "a city, bearing the name stuff, called by the Chinese stuff tun." That's definitely a placeholder or typo. "Kuzurkei" might be a misspelling or incorrect term. "Tun" in "stuff tun" is another instance of a placeholder. "Khunkeitzu" is likely a misspelling or incorrect transliteration.

Looking at grammar and syntax, there are a few issues. The sentence "the great high road -- joining K'ou-li (the territory inside the Great Wall) and K'ou-wai (the territory outside) has in North Kansu an E-W direction" is missing a comma after the introductory phrase. "some seven or eight kilometres south of the road, we rode past the first of the scattered dwellings of the Yögur village of Ma-chuang-tzu." This sentence could be clearer with a comma after "south of the road." The phrase "my camera, which I brought out carelessly, changed however the mental atmosphere at a stroke." The placement of "however" is awkward; it should be "changed the mental atmosphere at a stroke, however." The sentence "The lamas, on their arrival, appeared somewhat surprised at our intrusion but though the first meeting was rather cool, the ice soon was broken" has a comma splice. It should be "but though the first meeting was rather cool, the ice soon was broken" or split into two sentences. "The ruin near the present temple had belonged to a race of people, having tails, whom the Chinese call Kuzurkei." The phrase "having tails" is a dangling modifier. "There were seven or eight lamas, each living in his own clean little wooden house of two or three rooms, built and furnished in Chinese style." The phrase "built and furnished in Chinese style" is a dangling modifier. "A document written in a beatiful text-hand from the renowned lama monastery of Gumbum, these men could not decipher." The subject and verb are misplaced; it should be "A document written... could not be deciphered by these men."

In terms of coherence, the text's structure is a bit choppy. The transition from describing the landscape to the Yögur village is abrupt. The mention of the "stuff" multiple times without explanation creates confusion. The legend about the city and the tribe's migration is unclear due to the use of placeholders. The reference to "a thing" in the context of the tribe moving during Emperor K'ang-hsi's reign is confusing. The text jumps between different topics like the temple, the lamas, and the administrative structure without clear transitions. The mention of "the stuff" in various locations without specific names makes it hard to follow. The conclusion about the Yögur language and their history is a bit disjointed from the previous sections. The final paragraph about the houses and local administration feels a bit out of place compared to the earlier narrative.

For the fluency score, there are several spelling errors and grammatical issues that affect readability, but the text is generally understandable. I'd say a 3.5. For coherence, the text has some abrupt transitions and unclear references, but the overall narrative is mostly logical. A 3.5 as well.
