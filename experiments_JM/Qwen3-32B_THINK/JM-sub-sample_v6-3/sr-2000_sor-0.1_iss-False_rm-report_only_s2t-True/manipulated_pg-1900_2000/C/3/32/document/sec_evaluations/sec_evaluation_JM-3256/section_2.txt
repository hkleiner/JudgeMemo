Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The user wants me to check for issues in syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I'll scan through the text. The first sentence is "He is proudly conscious at the time that he is a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement..." That seems okay. The structure is a bit complex, but the grammar is correct. 

Next, "She has _not_ read _Mark Rutherford_, and he does not advise her to seek it at the circulating library, because it will not be there..." The use of underscores around "not" is a bit odd. Maybe it's for emphasis, but in standard writing, italics or bold would be more appropriate. The rest of the sentence is grammatically correct.

Then, "Twenty thousand people will greedily read _Twice Murdered and Once Hung_..." The title is in italics here, but in the previous paragraph, the titles are in italics as well. So that's consistent. The sentence structure is fine.

Looking at "And the children of the twenty thousand will not know _Twice Murdered_, but the children of the twenty, with others added to them, will know and love _Mark Rutherford_." The use of commas here is a bit heavy, but it's still understandable. Maybe a semicolon could be better, but it's not a major issue.

Moving on to "Mr. Augustine Birrell makes it, I think, a point of friendship that a man should love George Borrow..." The placement of "I think" in the middle of the sentence is a bit disruptive. It might be better placed at the end, but it's still clear.

The next part about "the _Revelation in the thing_ as a sound test..." The title is in italics again, which is correct. The sentence structure is okay.

The phrase "But . . . de gustibus . . . !" uses ellipses with spaces. Typically, ellipses are written without spaces, so that's a minor punctuation issue.

Now, the paragraph about the critic's office. The sentences are long but well-structured. The grammar is correct. 

In the French critic's quote, there are some complex sentences, but they're still clear. The use of "While ordinary books are houses..." is a metaphor, but the grammar is correct.

Looking at the part about the bookman and subjects: "He does not require Mr. Froude’s delightful apology to win the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ a place on his shelf..." The sentence is a bit convoluted, but it's grammatically correct. The use of "although the bookman may be far removed from Puritanism, yet he knows..." uses "yet" after "although," which is a bit awkward. Maybe "but" would be better here.

The sentence "and although he may be as far from a stuff, yet he must needs have his A’Kempis (especially in a stuff’s edition of 1828)" has a similar structure. The use of "stuff" is unclear here. It might be a typo or a term that's not properly explained. That's a potential issue.

In the last part, "Without a complete Milton he could not be content. He would like to have Masson’s Life too in 6 vols. (with index)." The reference to "Milton" is ambiguous. It could refer to John Milton or a person named Milton. The sentence is a bit abrupt but still understandable.

So, for fluency issues, the main problems are the use of underscores for emphasis instead of italics or bold, some awkward phrasing with "yet" after "although," the unclear term "stuff," and the ellipses with spaces. These are minor issues, so the fluency score would likely be a 4 or 4.5.

Now, coherence. The text discusses the difference between popular and enduring literature, using metaphors like houses vs. cathedrals and coasting crafts vs. stately merchantmen. The ideas flow logically from one to the next, building a comparison between transient and lasting works. 

The transition from discussing Mark Rutherford to Augustine Birrell and then to the role of the critic is smooth. The mention of the French critic and the examples of books (Milton, Masson’s Life) are relevant and support the main argument. 

There's a slight jump when moving from the French critic's quote to the metaphor of books as houses and cathedrals, but it's not a major issue. The text maintains a clear progression, and each paragraph builds on the previous one. 

Potential coherence issues could be the sudden shift to discussing the bookman's catholicity in the last paragraph, but it's connected to the previous discussion about the types of books a bookman values. The references to specific authors and books might be confusing without context, but the overall structure is coherent.

So, coherence issues are minimal. The text is well-organized, with logical flow and smooth transitions. The score here would likely be a 5 or 4.5.
