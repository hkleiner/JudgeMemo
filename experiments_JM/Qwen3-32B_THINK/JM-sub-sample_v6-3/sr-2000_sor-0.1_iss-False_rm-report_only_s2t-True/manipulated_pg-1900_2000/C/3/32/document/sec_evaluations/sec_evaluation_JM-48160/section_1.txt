Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency.

First, I'll look for grammatical errors. The text uses a lot of contractions and hyphens, which might be stylistic choices, but I need to check if they're used correctly. For example, "France to-day is sharply divided..." has "to-day" which is an older spelling; maybe it's intentional for period context. Then there's "sauf conduit" which seems like a French term, but the hyphenation and usage need to be checked. 

Next, punctuation. The sentence "But the other, the Zone des Armées, in common parlance the war or military zone!" has a comma splice. The exclamation mark at the end might be okay for emphasis, but the structure is a bit awkward. Also, the use of em dashes and parentheses might be inconsistent. For example, "the thing (the thing)" is a bit confusing with the repetition. 

Word choice and phrasing: The phrase "I made no attempt to enter this proscribed region for six or seven weeks after my arrival" uses "proscribed," which is correct, but the sentence is a bit long. There are instances where the author uses "thing" in quotes, which might be a stylistic choice to refer to institutions, but it could be unclear without context. 

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative about the author's experiences trying to enter the war zone. The flow is mostly chronological, but there are some shifts in focus. For example, after discussing the application process, the author suddenly shifts to the duchess's involvement, which could be a transition issue. 

The structure seems logical overall, but there are parts where the connections between ideas are not smooth. For instance, the mention of "the thing" multiple times without clear explanation might confuse readers unfamiliar with the context. Also, the author jumps from discussing Meaux to Verdun without a clear transition, which could affect the narrative flow. 

There's a part where the author lists several cities they want to visit, but the reasons for selecting some over others aren't clearly explained, leading to potential confusion. The use of "the thing" repeatedly without clarification might also make the text feel disjointed. 

Considering the evaluation criteria, fluency has minor issues like punctuation and word choice, but overall the text is readable. Coherence is mostly there but has some awkward transitions and unclear references. I'll need to assign scores based on the scale provided, considering half-points where appropriate.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [PUNCTUATION] Comma splice in "But the other, the Zone des Armées, in common parlance the war or military zone!"  
- [WORD CHOICE] Overuse of "the thing" as a vague placeholder, e.g., "the thing (the thing)"  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "France to-day is sharply divided into two sections; within the greater..."  
- [SPELLING] Non-standard spelling "to-day" (modern usage is "today")  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma in "I have spent a good part of my life in the thing, and long since..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from discussing the duchess's hospital to bureaucratic processes without clear transition  
- [CLARITY] Repetition of "the thing" without consistent definition creates ambiguity  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from Meaux to Verdun without contextual linkage  
- [STRUCTURE] Lists of cities (Châlons-sur-Marne, Vitry, etc.) lack explanation of selection criteria  
- [CONSISTENCY] Contradictory statements about urgency ("I broke them ruthlessly" vs. "it took so long for an application...")  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
