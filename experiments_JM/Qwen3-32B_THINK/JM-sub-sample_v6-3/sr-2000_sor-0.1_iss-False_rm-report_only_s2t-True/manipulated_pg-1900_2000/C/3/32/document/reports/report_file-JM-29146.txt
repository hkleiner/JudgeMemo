  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "stuffabeen" is a misspelled or nonsensical phrase.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of phonetic spellings (e.g., "joketh," "nevertheleth," "thith," "hath," "planetarithed," "Tranthfer Thervith," "thurrender," "meanth," "thelf-thupport") creates artificial dialect but disrupts standard fluency.
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Incomplete sentence: "He had an Earth-style name and had been born of Earth parents, he was not an thing."
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in the Earthgirl's telepathy description ("a feat growing less rare although by no means common yet among the offspring...").

        • Repetition of Ramsey’s gangway/gear actions from the previous section without clear purpose.

        • Sudden introduction of telepathy in the Earthgirl’s section lacks prior setup or explanation.
        • Stu Englander’s health and family details are introduced but not clearly tied to the main conflict.
