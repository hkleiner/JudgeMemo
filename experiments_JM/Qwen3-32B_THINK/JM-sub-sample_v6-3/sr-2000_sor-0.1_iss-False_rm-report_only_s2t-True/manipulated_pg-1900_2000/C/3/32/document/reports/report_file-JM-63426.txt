  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The text jumps abruptly from the narrator's work experiences to the description of a soap salesman across the street without clear transition.
        • The description of the soap salesman seems disconnected from the rest of the narrative about the narrator's work experiences.
        • The text ends with Mr. Newett walking to where there are guns and fishing rods without indicating what happens next or how this connects to the rest of the story.
        • The mention of "the Iron Ore job printer" leaving without clear explanation of who replaces them or what happens to the newspaper business.
        • The timeline of the narrator's age and wages is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner.
        • The text references "the Iron Ore job printer" and then later refers to "a stuff" without clear identification of these entities.
        • The transition from the narrator working at the print shop to Mr. Newett walking to guns and fishing rods is abrupt and unexplained.
