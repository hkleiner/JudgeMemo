Alright, I'm going to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the Likert scale from 1 to 5, with half-points allowed. Let me start by understanding what the text is about and what issues I might find.

First, let's understand the text:

The text is a literary piece discussing the concept of a "bookman" - someone who truly loves books and literature. It uses anecdotes and contrasts between people who merely own books and those who genuinely love books to explore what defines a true "bookman."

Now, let's evaluate for fluency:

Fluency refers to how well the text reads, focusing on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking at the text:

1. The text has complex sentence structures and archaic language ("It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress"), which may be challenging but doesn't necessarily indicate poor fluency.

2. There are some potential issues:
   - "his books may be those without which a gentlemanâ€™s library is not complete" - This sentence is grammatically correct but has a complex structure.
   - "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress" - The phrase "some becoming dress" is somewhat archaic but grammatically correct.
   - "He has not the wherewithal to purchase them" - This is a complex phrase but grammatically correct.
   - "My grateful memory retains an illustration of the difference between a bookowner and a bookman which I think is apropos" - The sentence is grammatically correct but has complex structure.
   - "He had in his courtesy invited me to dinner, which was excellent" - This is clear and grammatically correct.
   - "He desired to create an atmosphere" - Clear and grammatically correct.
   - "Across the magnificence of the hall we went in stately procession" - This is a complex sentence but grammatically correct.
   - "I was brought back from every temptation to break the laws of property by my chairman" - This is a complex sentence but grammatically correct.
   - "He was an admirable chairman, for he occupied no time with a review of literature in his address, and he slept without being noticed through mine (which is all I ask of a chairman)" - This is a complex sentence with a parenthetical comment, but grammatically correct.
   - "He fixed as by instinct on the two classics of the English tongue" - Grammatically correct.
   - "It is the merest pedantry for a man to defend himself with a shamed face for his light reading" - Grammatically correct.
   - "So far as I remember, The Mystery of a Hansom Cab and John Inglesant came out somewhat about the same time" - The placement of "somewhat" is a bit awkward but not incorrect.
   - "When people are raving between the soup and fish about some popular novel which to-morrow will be forgotten" - The phrase "between the soup and fish" is an idiom referring to dining, which is clear.
   - "It gives one bookman whom I know the keenest pleasure to ask his fair companion whether she has read Mark Rutherford" - This is grammatically correct.

Overall, the text is quite complex with many long sentences and archaic language, but I don't see any major grammatical errors. The complexity might make it harder to read for some, but it doesn't make the text difficult to understand. The author uses sophisticated language and complex sentence structures effectively.

For fluency, I would rate this text a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent and well-structured, though the complex sentence structures and archaic language may make it somewhat challenging for modern readers. There are no major grammatical issues that would significantly impact readability.

Now, let's evaluate for coherence:

Coherence refers to how well the ideas in the text are connected and how logically the text progresses.

Looking at the text:

1. The text has a clear central theme - the difference between a bookowner and a bookman.
2. The text uses anecdotes and examples to illustrate this theme.
3. There is a logical progression from defining what a bookman is to providing examples of bookmen.
4. The text connects ideas well, using transitions like "It is said," "It is the foolishness," "It is the merest pedantry," etc.
5. The text maintains a consistent focus on the theme throughout.
6. There are some complex ideas and transitions that might require more attention from the reader, but they don't disrupt the overall coherence.
7. The text ends with a strong conclusion about the nature of bookmen and their ability to distinguish between transient and lasting works of literature.

I don't see any major coherence issues. The text maintains a clear focus on its theme and connects ideas logically. The anecdotes are well-placed and support the central theme.

For coherence, I would rate this text a 5. The text is highly coherent, with a clear and logical progression throughout. The ideas connect smoothly to form a unified and well-organized whole.

Let me now summarize the issues for each category and provide the scores:

Fluency Issues:
- [COMPLEXITY] The text uses complex sentence structures that may be challenging for some readers.
- [ARCHAIC_LANGUAGE] The text contains archaic language and expressions that may be unfamiliar to modern readers.
- [WORD_CHOICE] Some word choices are unusual or complex, which may affect readability for some readers.
- [SENTENCE_STRUCTURE] The text has many long, complex sentences that may be difficult to parse for some readers.

Coherence Issues:
- [IDEA_CONNECTION] The text maintains a consistent focus on its theme, but the complex ideas and transitions may require more attention from the reader.
- [PROGRESSION] The text has a logical progression from defining what a bookman is to providing examples and a conclusion.
- [FOCUS] The text maintains a clear focus on the theme throughout.

Final Coherence Score: 5
Final Fluency Score: 4.5

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [COMPLEXITY] Excessive use of complex sentence structures that may hinder readability
- [ARCHAIC_LANGUAGE] Use of archaic expressions like "wherewithal" and "fourpence-halfpenny" that may be unfamiliar to modern readers
- [WORD_CHOICE] Some word choices are unusual or overly elaborate ("precious life-blood of a Master Spirit")
- [SENTENCE_STRUCTURE] Long, complex sentences that are grammatically correct but may challenge comprehension

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGICAL_FLOW] The text maintains logical progression but contains some abrupt shifts in narrative perspective
- [CONNECTION] Some transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, particularly between the main narrative and anecdotal examples
- [FOCUS] While the central theme is clear, the text occasionally digresses into specific examples that could be more clearly connected to the main argument
- [UNITY] The text maintains a consistent focus on bookmen vs. book owners but could benefit from clearer signposting between different examples

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
