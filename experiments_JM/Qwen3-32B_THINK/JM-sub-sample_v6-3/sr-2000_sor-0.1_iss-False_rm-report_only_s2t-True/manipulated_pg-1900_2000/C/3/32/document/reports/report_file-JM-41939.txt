Section section_01 (Chars 0–8413):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Repeated use of "the stuff/the thing" instead of specific locations (e.g., "living in a stuff," "the thing in the centre").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic phrasing ("the fairies who presided at his birth omitted to endow him with riches") that feels inconsistent with modern readability.
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Awkward sentence structure in "the young couple started upon married life with no other fortune than their mutual attachment and equal courage."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transitions between events (e.g., sudden shift from the Silvelas leaving to the Bonheurs moving to Paris without clear cause-effect).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear references to "the thing" instead of specific locations, creating confusion about settings (e.g., "installed in the Rue Saint-Antoine" vs. "the thing").
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Jumps in time and context (e.g., moving from the 1830 revolution to the cholera outbreak in 1832 with minimal explanatory linkage).

Section section_02 (Chars 8414–12717):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "the thing" used instead of "the Salon" in two instances, causing confusion
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "The students and copyists who regularly frequented the museum, not knowing her name, had christened her 'the little hussard.'" (comma placement disrupts flow)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Overly long sentences with complex clauses (e.g., "This is how she came to acquire her clever talent for sculpture which would have sufficed...")
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from domestic menagerie to "slaughter-houses, markets, the thing" without clear transition
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous reference to "the thing" disrupts narrative flow and reader understanding
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Minor abruptness between paragraphs describing her living locations and animal study routines
