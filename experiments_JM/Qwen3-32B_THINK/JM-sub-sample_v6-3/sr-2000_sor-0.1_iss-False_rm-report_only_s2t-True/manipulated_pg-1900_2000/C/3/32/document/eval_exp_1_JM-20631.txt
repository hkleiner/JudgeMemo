Alright, let's analyze the evaluation report to determine the final scores for coherence and fluency.

### Coherence Issues Across Sections
**Section 01 (Chars 0–8709):**
- Abrupt transitions between historical examples of ritual languages (Welsh, Slav, Buddhist) without clear thematic linkage
- Unclear references to "a thing" disrupting logical flow
- Sudden shift from Arthur Davis's biography to abstract discussions of language revival
- Jarring juxtaposition of Germanism/Jewish comparisons with Deuteronomy's violent passages without context

**Section 02 (Chars 8710–12364):**
- Abrupt shifts between historical examples (from biblical figures to modern figures like Vehaeren)
- Disconnected ideas between sections (from "chosen people" to Maimonides' "Guide to the Perplexed")
- Unclear progression between paragraphs (from "Chosen People" to "Life alone that can give us the clue")
- Repetition of "a thing" without resolution creates confusion
- References to external texts (e.g., "Passover Seder Service") lack sufficient explanation

Overall, the text shows significant issues with logical flow, thematic linkage, and contextual clarity. The abrupt transitions and disconnected ideas affect the overall coherence of the text.

### Fluency Issues Across Sections
**Section 01 (Chars 0–8709):**
- Awkward phrasing in complex sentences
- Repetition of "a thing"
- Misplaced commas in complex sentences
- Inconsistent use of punctuation

**Section 02 (Chars 8710–12364):**
- Repeated use of "a thing" without clear meaning
- Long, run-on sentences with missing punctuation
- Ambiguous antecedents
- Inconsistent capitalization
- Awkward phrasing in religious references

The text has notable issues with syntax, grammar, punctuation, and clarity. These issues impact the smooth reading experience.

### Final Scores

**Coherence:**
The text has significant problems with logical flow and thematic progression. The abrupt transitions, disconnected ideas, and unclear references suggest a score in the lower range. Given the issues described, I would rate this as a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make the overall coherence difficult to follow without extra effort, but it's not completely incoherent.

**Fluency:**
The text has multiple grammatical, syntactical, and punctuation issues that affect readability. The awkward phrasing and repetition of "a thing" disrupt the flow. Given these issues, I would rate this as a 3.0. The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.

Let me revise my assessment based on the scales provided:

**Coherence (2.5):**
The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and abrupt transitions that significantly disrupt the flow and make understanding difficult without extra effort.

**Fluency (3.0):**
The text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical, syntactical, and punctuation issues that interrupt the flow or clarity in noticeable ways.

So my final assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
