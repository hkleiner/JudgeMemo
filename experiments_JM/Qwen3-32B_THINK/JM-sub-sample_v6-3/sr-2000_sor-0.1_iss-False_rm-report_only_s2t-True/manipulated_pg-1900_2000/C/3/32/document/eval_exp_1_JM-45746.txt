Let me analyze the evaluation report to determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

For fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 3.5 with issues in grammar, syntax, clarity, spelling, and punctuation.
- Section 02 has a score of 3.5 with issues in syntax, punctuation, and word choice.

Recurring fluency problems across sections include:
- Awkward and complex sentence structures
- Punctuation errors (especially missing commas and misuse of em dashes)
- Word choice and phrasing issues that affect readability
- Some spelling problems

These issues are consistent across both sections, with no indication of improvement from section to section. Given that both sections scored 3.5, and the problems are consistent, I would rate the overall fluency as 3.5.

For coherence:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.0 but has issues with structure, logic, transitions, and context.
- Section 02 has a score of 3.5 with issues in structure, logic, and clarity.

Recurring coherence problems across sections include:
- Abrupt transitions between ideas and paragraphs
- Unclear or illogical connections between sections
- Disjointed shifts between different narrative threads
- Timeline inconsistencies

The coherence scores show a decline from section 01 to section 02, with section 02 having more significant issues. Given the consistent problems and the lower score in the second section, I would rate the overall coherence as 3.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
