Alright, let's analyze the evaluation report to determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency.

For Coherence:
- In section_01, the text has a score of 3.0 with issues related to logic (sudden mentions of modern tech in a historical narrative), structure (abrupt transitions), and clarity (inconsistent tone).
- In section_02, the score is 4.5 but still has issues with logic (shift from Christmas hymns to retinal implants) and structure (abrupt transitions from historical analysis to modern metaphors).

For Fluency:
- Section_01 has a score of 4.0 with issues in syntax (complex sentences), lexicon (ambiguous phrasing), and punctuation (overuse of semicolons/em-dashes).
- Section_02 has a higher score of 4.5 with fewer issues, but still has some lexicon and syntax problems.

Now let's determine the final scores based on the evaluation criteria:

Coherence:
The text shows a significant issue in section_01 with a score of 3.0, indicating "noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience." In section_02, while the score is better at 4.5, there are still some coherence issues with logic and structure. Given the severity of the issues in section_01 and the fact that the text has a mix of good and problematic coherence, I would rate the overall Coherence as 3.5. This reflects that the text is generally coherent but has noticeable issues that affect the reading experience.

Fluency:
Both sections have relatively high fluency scores (4.0 and 4.5). The issues reported are primarily minor: complex sentences, ambiguous phrasing, punctuation issues, and some non-standard phrasing. These are not severe enough to significantly impact readability. Given the high scores in both sections and the relatively minor nature of the issues, I would rate the overall Fluency as 4.25. However, since we can only use half-point increments, I'll round this to 4.0.

So my final assessment would be:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
