Let me carefully evaluate the provided text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

First, I'll identify fluency issues in the text:

1. [GRAMMAR] "The city of Nacogdoches, as a civic corporation, dates from that year, in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and bewildered followers from their experimental settlement of Bucareli on the Trinity river, to the old Mission of Guadalupe." - This is a very long sentence with multiple clauses that should be separated for better readability.

2. [SPELLING] "Trinity river" should be "Trinity River" with a capital R as it's a proper noun.

3. [GRAMMAR] "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity, somewhere between the Sabine and Red rivers." - This sentence has a somewhat awkward structure with "a shadowy, uncertain quantity" being an unusual way to describe a boundary.

4. [GRAMMAR] "Louisiana belonged to Spain, and the government was but little concerned to mark out definitely the exact limitation between its provinces." - This sentence is awkwardly worded and could be more concise.

5. [GRAMMAR] "Gil Ybarbo recognized the necessity of a commissary for the storing of military and commercial supplies, and after applying to the authorities in Mexico for such a building, and growing weary of the endless delays and red tape, that industrious old Spaniard erected on his own account what he and his followers called 'The Stone House,' now generally referred to as 'The Old Stone Fort.'" - This is another very long sentence with multiple clauses that should be separated.

6. [SPELLING] "commissary" is used in a way that may be confusing - it typically refers to a place where supplies are distributed, not stored.

7. [GRAMMAR] "It was not erected primarily as a fort, but as a house of commerce; and that has been its main use throughout its varied history." - The semicolon usage is awkward here.

8. [SPELLING] "The new city grew apace, and by the beginning of the Nineteenth Century embraced a population of several hundred souls." - "Nineteenth Century" should have a capital C.

9. [GRAMMAR] "Don Carlos de Zepeda succeeded Ybarbo as Lieutenant Governor, and in turn was followed by a succession of officials who had charge of the public business of the town, and superintended legal and commercial affairs, in addition to leading what military expeditions were needed in their infrequent exigencies." - This sentence is overly complex and could be more clearly expressed.

10. [GRAMMAR] "Nacogdoches was at that time the second largest town in Texas." - This sentence is clear but the use of "at that time" is somewhat redundant.

11. [GRAMMAR] "In 1800 Nacogdoches was a loyal Spanish town, as was shown by the part it took in the suppression of Philip Nolan’s expedition." - This is a clear sentence.

12. [GRAMMAR] "Nolan had been reared by General James Wilkinson, commander of the United States forces at Natchez, Mississippi." - This is a clear sentence.

13. [GRAMMAR] "A drone swarm aligned in formation." - This sentence appears out of place and doesn't relate to the historical content of the rest of the text.

14. [GRAMMAR] "The population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his Garrison, when they were ordered to pursue and arrest the little band." - "Were" should be "was" to agree with the singular "population."

15. [GRAMMAR] "Lieutenant Bernardo D’Ortolan, a Frenchman by birth, was left in charge of the garrison here while Musquiz was on his expedition; during this time he conveyed titles to land to such settlers as applied for them." - The semicolon usage is awkward here.

16. [GRAMMAR] "The automated gate slid open." - This sentence also appears out of place and doesn't relate to the historical content of the rest of the text.

Now for coherence issues:

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the historical narrative of Nacogdoches to a completely unrelated mention of "A drone swarm aligned in formation" and later "The automated gate slid open." These modern, sci-fi elements have no connection to the historical content and disrupt the logical flow.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text moves through several different phases of Nacogdoches' history, but the transitions between these phases are not always clear or smooth.

3. [LOGIC] The text mentions "Nacogdoches—The Spanish Town" and then "CHAPTER: Philip Nolan" but these chapter headings are not clearly marked or separated from the main text, making the structure confusing.

4. [LOGIC] The text mentions "The city of Nacogdoches, as a civic corporation, dates from that year" but doesn't clearly establish what "that year" refers to, creating confusion.

5. [LOGIC] The text mentions "Don Carlos de Zepeda succeeded Ybarbo as Lieutenant Governor, and in turn was followed by a succession of officials" but doesn't provide a clear chronology of these officials.

6. [LOGIC] The text mentions "The automated gate slid open" at the end, which is completely disconnected from the historical narrative and creates confusion.

Based on these observations:

For Fluency Score:
The text has some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, but overall it is mostly readable and the historical narrative is generally clear. The sentences are often long and complex, but not so much that they prevent understanding. I would rate the fluency as a 3.5 - the text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow.

For Coherence Score:
The text has a major issue with the inclusion of unrelated modern elements ("A drone swarm aligned in formation" and "The automated gate slid open") that completely disrupt the historical narrative. These elements create a disjointed reading experience and make the text confusing. The structure is also somewhat confusing with the chapter headings not being clearly marked. I would rate the coherence as a 2.5 - the text has frequent inconsistencies and some disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort.
