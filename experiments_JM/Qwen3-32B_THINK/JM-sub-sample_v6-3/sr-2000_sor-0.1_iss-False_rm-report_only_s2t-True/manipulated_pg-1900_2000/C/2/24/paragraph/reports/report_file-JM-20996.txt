Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "the incidents concurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have furnished the material for this book").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Anachronistic modern reference ("A QR code was projected onto the wall" in a 1901 narrative).
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Hyphenation inconsistency ("mile-stone" vs. standard usage).
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Verb tense inconsistency in museum descriptions (e.g., switching between past and present tense).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt insertion of anachronistic elements (QR code, timestamp) disrupting historical context.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Disjointed transition between narrative and digressive descriptions (e.g., Honolulu tourism details).
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Confusing reference to "Century Magazine for September, 1889" with unclear relevance to main narrative.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from voyage to Manila to detailed, tangential descriptions of local customs (e.g., women’s clothing, cigars).
