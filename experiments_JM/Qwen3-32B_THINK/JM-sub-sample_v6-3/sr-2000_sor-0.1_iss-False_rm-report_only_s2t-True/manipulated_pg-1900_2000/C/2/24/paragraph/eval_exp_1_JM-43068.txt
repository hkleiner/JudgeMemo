Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the overall Coherence and Fluency of a text based on the section-wise report. The instructions are clear: use the given criteria and scale, avoid explanations, just output the scores.

First, looking at Fluency. Each section has a Fluency score of 4.5 and 4.5. The issues in section_01 are grammar errors like subject-verb agreement and awkward phrasing. Section_02 has grammar, syntax, passive voice, punctuation issues. But both sections have high fluency scores. The errors are present but not so severe to bring the score down. Since both sections are 4.5, maybe the overall is 4.5. But wait, the user allows half-points. Let me check if there's any pattern. The first section has a 4.5, and the second also 4.5. So combining them, maybe 4.5 is the average. But maybe the overall is a bit lower because there are more issues in section_02. However, the scores per section are 4.5 each, so the average would be 4.5. So Fluency might stay at 4.5.

Now Coherence. Section_01 has a 2.5, which is quite low. Section_02 is 4.0. The issues in section_01 are a non-sequitur and abrupt transitions with no context. Section_02 has some logical issues, abrupt shifts, weak transitions, repetition, and ambiguous references. The first section's Coherence is significantly lower. How does this average out? The overall Coherence might be a 3.0 or 3.5. The first section's 2.5 is a big problem, but the second is 4.0. Let me see the scale. If one section is 2.5 and another is 4.0, the average is 3.25, which is 3.25, but the allowed scores are half points. So 3.25 would round to 3.0 or 3.5. But maybe the overall is worse than the average because the first section is so low. Coherence is about the whole text's flow. If the first section has a major coherence issue, that might drag the overall score down. The second section is better, but the first is problematic. So maybe the overall Coherence is 3.0 or 3.5. Let's check the criteria. For Coherence, a 3 is "noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that affect the reading experience." The first section has a sudden non-sequitur and abrupt transition. The second section has some transitions but is better. So combining these, the overall Coherence might be 3.0. Alternatively, if the two sections' issues are considered, maybe it's 3.5. Hmm. The first section's 2.5 is quite low, but the second is 4.0. Let me think again. The first section's Coherence issues are severe enough to bring the overall down. If one section is 2.5 and another is 4.0, the average is 3.25. Since the allowed scores are in half points, 3.25 would be 3.5. But maybe the overall is worse because the first section's issues are more critical. The first section's problems are more disruptive. So perhaps the overall Coherence score is 3.0. Alternatively, maybe 3.5. Let me check the scale again. A 3 is "noticeable...affect the reading experience." If the first section has a major issue, and the second is okay, the overall might be a 3.0. But the second section is 4.0, which is mostly coherent. So the average would be 3.25, which is 3.5 when rounded to the nearest half-point. So the Coherence score is 3.5. Fluency is 4.5 as both sections are 4.5. But wait, the first section's Fluency is 4.5, and the second is 4.5. So the average is 4.5. So the final scores would be Coherence 3.5 and Fluency 4.5.
