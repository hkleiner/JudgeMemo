Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency issues. The text has some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, the sentence "The laser display turned off automatically." seems out of place and doesn't connect with the rest. Then there's "A home pod switched tracks." which is confusing and doesn't make sense in context. The phrase "The two jobbers are kicked." is also unclear; maybe it's a typo for "jobbers are hired" or something else. There's a question mark in "heated (?) with one stove." which is odd and might be a formatting error. Some sentences are run-on, like the one about the print shop being above a saloon and in a barn room. Also, the structure of some sentences is a bit choppy, which affects the flow.

Now for coherence. The text jumps around a bit. The mention of the laser display and home pod doesn't fit with the rest of the narrative about the print shop and the narrator's work. The story moves from the narrator's job to a trial involving Theodore Roosevelt, then back to the print shop, which might be confusing. There's a sudden shift when talking about the print shop location and the editor's office. Also, the part about the faker selling soap and the kerosene flare is a bit disjointed from the previous content. The timeline isn't always clear, like when the narrator is 12, 13, etc., which could be better connected. Some transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, making it hard to follow the sequence of events.
