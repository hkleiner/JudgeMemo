Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The text is quite lengthy and seems to be a historical narrative with some descriptive elements. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or awkward phrasing. 

Looking at the first paragraph under "Preface," the sentence structure is complex but generally correct. However, there are a few instances where the syntax could be improved for better clarity. For example, "the incidents concurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have furnished the material for this book" is a bit wordy and could be simplified. 

Next, in Chapter I, the sentence "A QR code was projected onto the wall" seems out of place and might be a modern addition that doesn't fit the historical context. This could be a typo or an error in the text. 

There are also some instances of inconsistent verb tenses. For example, in the section about the Bishop Museum, the text switches between past and present tense when describing the exhibits. This inconsistency might confuse the reader. 

Spelling errors are minimal, but I notice "mile-stone" is hyphenated, which might be a stylistic choice but could be considered non-standard. Additionally, the use of "silvery hair little indicated the probability of such a blunder" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for smoother flow. 

Moving on to coherence, the text transitions between different topics, such as the historical event, the journey to the Philippines, and descriptions of places in Honolulu. While the narrative is generally logical, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, the sudden mention of the QR code and timestamp seems disconnected from the main narrative about the 1901 event. 

The structure of the text is mostly chronological, but some sections, like the detailed description of the Bishop Museum and the surf-shooting, might feel like digressions that don't directly contribute to the main story. This could affect the overall coherence by making the narrative less focused. 

There's also a reference to "Century Magazine for September, 1889" which is a historical document but might be confusing as it's inserted in the middle of the narrative without clear context. The mention of Napoleon's anecdote also seems out of place and might not be directly relevant to the main subject. 

The transition from the voyage to the arrival in Manila is smooth, but the detailed description of the women's clothing and the mention of cigars might be excessive and could be seen as unnecessary details that don't enhance the main narrative. 

Overall, the text has some minor fluency issues and a few coherence problems due to abrupt transitions and digressions. However, the majority of the text is well-structured and readable. The use of complex sentences and some anachronistic elements like the QR code might affect the fluency and coherence scores slightly.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences (e.g., "the incidents concurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have furnished the material for this book").  
- [LEXICON] Anachronistic modern reference ("A QR code was projected onto the wall" in a 1901 narrative).  
- [SPELLING] Hyphenation inconsistency ("mile-stone" vs. standard usage).  
- [GRAMMAR] Verb tense inconsistency in museum descriptions (e.g., switching between past and present tense).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt insertion of anachronistic elements (QR code, timestamp) disrupting historical context.  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition between narrative and digressive descriptions (e.g., Honolulu tourism details).  
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "Century Magazine for September, 1889" with unclear relevance to main narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from voyage to Manila to detailed, tangential descriptions of local customs (e.g., womenâ€™s clothing, cigars).  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
