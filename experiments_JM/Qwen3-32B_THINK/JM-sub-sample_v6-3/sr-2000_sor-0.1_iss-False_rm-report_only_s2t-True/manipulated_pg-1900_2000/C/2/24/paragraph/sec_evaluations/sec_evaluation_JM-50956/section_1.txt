Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency Issues. The text is a historical pamphlet from 1920, so some of the language might be old-fashioned or archaic. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice.

First, I notice some hyphenation issues. For example, "three-four times" instead of "three to four times." Also, there's a typo in "Bolshevism" which is correct, but maybe "Bolshevist" later. Wait, no, "Bolshevist" is a variant spelling, so that's okay. 

Looking at the structure, the sentences are long and complex, which might be a style choice but could affect fluency. For example, the sentence starting with "Russia's losses, says Col. Shumsky-Solomonov..." has a comma splice. Also, some phrases are awkward, like "The number of Russia's casualties is larger than the total population of any of the following European countries..." The comparison is a bit confusing because it's mixing casualties (people who died or were injured) with total population. That might be a logic issue, but in terms of fluency, the phrasing is a bit off.

There's also a sentence fragment: "The ambient light changed hue." This seems out of place and doesn't relate to the rest of the text. Maybe a typo or a misplaced sentence. Similarly, "The battery read full capacity." is another sentence fragment that doesn't fit the context. These would be fluency issues because they disrupt the flow.

Now for Coherence. The text is about Russia's role in WWI. The main idea is that Russia's sacrifices were crucial. The structure is chronological, discussing different years and battles. However, the sudden mentions of "The ambient light changed hue" and "The battery read full capacity" are confusing. These phrases don't relate to the content and break the flow of the narrative. They might be typos or errors from the original text, but they make the text incoherent.

Another coherence issue is the transition between the introduction and the next chapter. The first part is an introduction with the author's credentials and the pamphlet's purpose. Then it jumps into statistics and historical events. The transition is abrupt but maybe expected in a pamphlet. However, the misplaced sentences mentioned earlier really disrupt the logical flow.

There's also a bit of repetition in emphasizing Russia's sacrifices and their impact, but it's not too bad. The main issue is the two out-of-context sentences that don't fit the topic at all. These would cause confusion and make the text less coherent.

For the fluency score, considering the archaic language but mostly correct grammar, except for the sentence fragments and some awkward phrasing. The errors are minor but present. I'd say a 4.5. The coherence is affected more by those two sentences, which are very disruptive. So maybe a 4 for coherence, but since the errors are only two sentences in a long text, maybe a 4.5. Wait, the coherence scale says a 5 is highly coherent with minor issues. If the main issue is two misplaced sentences, but the rest is logical, maybe a 4.5. However, the two sentences are quite jarring. The coherence score might be a 4 because those two issues do disrupt the flow significantly. Hmm, need to decide if those two sentences are enough to lower the score to 4. Since they are so out of place, it's a 4.5 or maybe 4. Let me check the scale again. For coherence, a 4 is "mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts." The two sentences are disconnected but maybe only a few instances. So maybe a 4.5. Similarly, fluency has some issues but overall is mostly fluent. So fluency 4.5 and coherence 4.5. Wait, but the two sentences are more coherence issues than fluency. Fluency is about grammar and flow, while coherence is about logical structure. The misplaced sentences are coherence issues. So coherence would be lower because of that. Let's say coherence is 4, fluency 4.5. But I'm a bit conflicted. The main fluency issues are the sentence fragments and awkward phrasing, which are minor. The coherence issues are the two out-of-context sentences. Since the rest of the text is logically structured, maybe coherence is 4.5. But the two sentences are pretty bad. I think the coherence score should be 4, and fluency 4.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "three-four times" instead of "three to four times".  
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragment: "The ambient light changed hue."  
- [GRAMMAR] Sentence fragment: "The battery read full capacity."  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome phrasing in "Russia's losses... are more than twice the total strength... three-four times all the forces..."  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected sentences: "The ambient light changed hue." and "The battery read full capacity." (no relation to context).  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition between historical analysis and misplaced technical phrases.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
