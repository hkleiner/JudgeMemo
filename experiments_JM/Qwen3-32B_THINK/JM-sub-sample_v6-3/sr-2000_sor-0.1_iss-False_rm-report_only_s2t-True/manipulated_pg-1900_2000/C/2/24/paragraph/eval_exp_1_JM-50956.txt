Alright, let's take a look at the evaluation report to determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll analyze the fluency issues across both sections:
- In section 01, there are some syntax issues (awkward phrasing) and two sentence fragments. The score is 4.5, indicating mostly fluent with minor issues.
- In section 02, there are more significant fluency problems: grammar errors (singular/plural mismatch, subjunctive mood error), spelling errors, awkward syntax, and out-of-context sentences. The score here is 3.5, which means generally readable but with multiple issues that interrupt the flow.

For coherence:
- In section 01, the coherence score is 4.5. The issues include disconnected sentences and an abrupt transition between historical analysis and technical phrases.
- In section 02, the coherence score drops to 3.0. The issues are more severe: random sentences disrupting flow, abrupt topic jumps, unclear support for claims, one-sided presentation, repetitive structure, and poorly articulated arguments.

Now, I'll determine the final scores based on these evaluations:

For fluency:
Section 01 has minor issues (4.5) while section 02 has more significant problems (3.5) with grammar, spelling, syntax, and out-of-context sentences. The issues in section 02 are more numerous and impactful. I would rate the overall fluency as 3.5 because while section 01 is mostly fine, section 02 has enough problems to bring the average down to the lower end of the "mostly fluent" category.

For coherence:
Section 01 has a high score (4.5) with only minor issues, but section 02 has a significant drop to 3.0 with multiple coherence problems. The issues in section 02 include random sentences, abrupt topic jumps, and unclear arguments. I would rate the overall coherence as 3.0 since the second section has more substantial coherence problems that affect the overall flow and understanding of the text.

Based on this analysis, my final scores would be:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
