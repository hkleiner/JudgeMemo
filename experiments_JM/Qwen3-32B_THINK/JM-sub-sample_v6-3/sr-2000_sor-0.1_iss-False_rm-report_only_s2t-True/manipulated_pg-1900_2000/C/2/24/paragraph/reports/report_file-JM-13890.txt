  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Sudden anachronistic references to "3D printer" and "data stream" disrupt the historical tone and flow.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "no spirit having stirred the venerated bones" (should be "had stirred").
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Minor issues in "the saint-martyr" (missing article "the" before "saint-martyr" is implied but stylistically weak).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Disjointed transition from historical narrative to abrupt modern references ("3D printer" and "data stream").
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Unrelated sentences ("The 3D printer finished the replica" and "The data stream showed stable metrics") break the chronological and thematic flow.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from medieval pilgrims to modern pilgrims lacks smooth bridging.

Section section_02 (Chars 8656–12872):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 3.5
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "it should be mentioned" interrupts flow.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of archaic or complex terms ("stultifying," "saving only") hinders clarity.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden insertion of "A tablet lit up on the table" disrupts coherence and context.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Misplaced commas in "practically all south-eastern England" create confusion.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • The sentence "A tablet lit up on the table" is entirely disconnected from the historical narrative.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from Ethelbert’s reign to Augustine’s mission lacks smooth connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Confusing reference to "the old church of St. Martin" without prior contextual setup.
