Section section_01 (Chars 0–8500):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures in some passages (e.g., "And we ate and we drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of reasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Ambiguous phrasing in "ridicule is in the vision, not in what is seen" (potential for misinterpretation).
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Overuse of semicolons and em-dashes in dense paragraphs (e.g., "We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we do pretend").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden, jarring mentions of modern technology ("Notifications appeared on the smartwatch," "A thermal sensor picked up movement") disrupt the historical/reflective narrative.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Abrupt transition between the final line of Chapter One ("Another and a crowning proof...") and the unrelated technological sentences.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Inconsistent tone between the literary prose and the intrusive technical descriptions, breaking immersion.
