Alright, let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria.

**Fluency Issues:**

1) [GRAMMAR] - "So it came about--'twas in that year..." has an awkward construction with the em dash and the use of "'twas" which is archaic and could be confusing.
2) [SYNTAX] - "the year that saw the Pompadour come to supreme power (she had been for three years the king's acknowledged mistress)" has a complex structure with a parenthetical explanation that disrupts the flow.
3) [LEXICON] - "bundled off with him in a diligence" uses "diligence" in an archaic sense that may be confusing to modern readers.
4) [SYNTAX] - "burst with the shy youth into the studio" has awkward phrasing that makes the action unclear.
5) [SPELLING] - There are no obvious spelling errors, but some archaic or uncommon words may be difficult for some readers.
6) [SYNTAX] - "whilst his mother poured out in the rough accent of Provence the tale of the genius of her son--stole, too, a stealthy scrutiny..." has a long, complex sentence that's difficult to follow.
7) [GRAMMAR] - "The artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement'..." has an unclear meaning with the term "in little."
8) [SYNTAX] - "The Director-General of Buildings to the king (or, as we should nowadays call him, Minister of Fine Arts), Lenormant de Tournehem..." has a long, complex sentence with multiple parenthetical explanations.
9) [SYNTAX] - "It was in this year that Boucher was given a studio and apartments at the Louvre." is a bit awkward in structure.
10) [GRAMMAR] - "He continued to work in Boucher's studio, as well as painting on his own account" has a slightly awkward phrasing.
11) [SYNTAX] - "Meanwhile the quarrels between priests and parliaments had grown very bitter." is a simple statement but the transition from the previous content is abrupt.

**Coherence Issues:**

1) [LOGIC] - The text jumps from Fragonard's training with Boucher to his work with Chardin to his return to Boucher without clear transitions.
2) [STRUCTURE] - The narrative moves from one historical figure to another without clear connections or transitions.
3) [TRANSITION] - The transition from Fragonard's training to the death of Lenormant de Tournehem is abrupt and lacks context.
4) [CLARITY] - The explanation of the tapestry-making process is complex and could be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the terminology.
5) [LOGIC] - The sudden mention of the Damiens assassination at the end seems disconnected from the previous narrative about Fragonard.
6) [LOGIC] - The text moves from Fragonard's artistic training to political events without clear connections or transitions.
7) [CLARITY] - Some historical references and titles (e.g., "Director-General of Buildings to the king") are not clearly explained in context.
8) [STRUCTURE] - The narrative has multiple subplots (Fragonard's training, political events, Boucher's career) that are not well-integrated.

Now, let me assign scores based on these observations:

For Fluency:
The text has several grammatical and syntactic issues, as well as some archaic language that could be confusing. However, it is generally readable and the issues don't severely impede understanding. I would rate it a 3.5. The text is mostly fluent but contains enough issues to make it less than perfect.

For Coherence:
The text has significant issues with logical flow and transitions between different topics. The narrative jumps between Fragonard's story and various historical events without clear connections. The ending with the Damiens assassination feels disconnected from the previous content. This affects the overall coherence. I would rate it a 2.5. The text has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make it difficult to follow without extra effort.
