Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "A mobile hotspot activated" is an out-of-context phrase with no grammatical or semantic relation to the text.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "dog Latin" is used without explanation, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the term.
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "fellahìn" contains an unusual diacritic that may distract readers.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "The terror of his name did not die with him, but for long did good service to his successors" disrupts flow.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden insertion of "A mobile hotspot activated" breaks the historical narrative and logical progression.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from discussing tablets to the Egyptian court in Chapter II lacks smooth connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The term "dog Latin" is introduced without contextual definition, creating ambiguity.

Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward passive constructions in "Nothing being known of the life..."
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Ambiguous phrasing in "the doctrine... was regarded as so entirely a matter of home politics..."
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Overly complex sentences with nested clauses (e.g., "These men acted, of course, for their own interests in promptly resisting even mild attempts at reform")
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Minor inconsistency in "Amen-hetep" vs. "Akhen-Aten" (not an error, but stylistically uneven)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden anachronistic phrase "The voice-activated controls blinked to life" disrupts historical context.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from religious reforms to administrative details of officials without clear linkage.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear connection between the queen-mother’s visits and the broader narrative of religious reform.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Dense, information-heavy paragraphs with insufficient signposting between thematic shifts (e.g., from capital construction to vassal governance).
