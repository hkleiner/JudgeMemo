Alright, let's go through the evaluation report step by step to determine the final scores for Fluency and Coherence.

First, for Fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.0 with issues in syntax, punctuation, spelling, and lexicon. The issues include awkward phrasing, overuse of punctuation, British vs. American spelling, and ambiguous references.
- Section 02 also has a score of 4.0 with similar issues in syntax, punctuation, and grammar. It mentions overly complex sentences, missing commas, and awkward phrasing.

The recurring issues are primarily minor: awkward phrasing, punctuation issues, and ambiguous references. There's no indication of major or frequent errors that would significantly impact readability. Both sections are rated 4.0, so the overall fluency score should likely be around 4.0.

Now for Coherence:
- Section 01 has a score of 3.5 with issues in logic, transitions, and clarity. It mentions sudden insertions, disjointed mentions, abrupt shifts, and unclear antecedents.
- Section 02 has a score of 4.0 with issues in logic, clarity, structure, and transitions. It includes sudden shifts, ambiguous references, abrupt jumps, and unclear connections.

The issues here are more varied and impactful. Section 01 has a lower score (3.5) due to more noticeable coherence problems, while Section 02 is slightly better at 4.0 but still has some issues. The recurring problems include sudden shifts, unclear transitions, and ambiguous references. Given that one section has a 3.5 and the other a 4.0, the average would be around 3.75. However, since the lower section (3.5) has more severe issues, I might round down to 3.5 or give a score slightly below 4.0.

Based on these assessments, the final scores would be:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
