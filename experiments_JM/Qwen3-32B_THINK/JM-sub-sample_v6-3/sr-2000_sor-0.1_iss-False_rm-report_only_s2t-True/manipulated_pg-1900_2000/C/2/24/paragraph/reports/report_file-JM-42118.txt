  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex and convoluted sentence structures (e.g., "the attenuated ghosts of these once frantic things wriggled southwards through the provinces on but sluggish feet...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Archaic or overly ornate phrasing ("much bewigged and powdered year," "nay, scarce gave serious thought").
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • Awkward subject-verb agreement in phrases like "the room where the child first saw the light were gloomy enough within."
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Excessive use of commas and semicolons in long sentences, creating readability strain.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden, unexplained shifts between Fragonard’s biography and unrelated political/historical details (e.g., the Pompadour’s influence vs. Fragonard’s childhood).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Disjointed insertion of anachronistic phrases like "the holographic map rotated slowly" and "A storage cloud expanded its archive," which disrupt narrative flow.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transitions between paragraphs, particularly between the description of Grasse and the detailed political history of Louis XV.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear connections between Fragonard’s artistic development and the broader historical context (e.g., how Boucher’s work relates to Fragonard’s).
