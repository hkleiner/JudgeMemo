Let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence issues.

### Fluency Analysis

I'll look for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation issues:

1. [PUNCTUATION] The text has inconsistent punctuation, particularly in the first paragraph where there are frequent em dashes without proper punctuation before them.
2. [PUNCTUATION] The phrase "1807, of how standing grain looks after it has been crushed and trampled by the onrush of a charge" has misplaced punctuation with a comma instead of a colon or dash.
3. [SPELLING] "A phone rang from across the room" appears out of place and contextually inappropriate in this historical narrative about Meissonier.
4. [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly complex and could be clearer, such as the long sentence about David's influence on the national school of French art.
5. [WORD CHOICE] Some phrases are somewhat awkward or imprecise, such as "the press, the art clubs, not to mention the salons, were all more or less divided between the romantics and the classicists, the innovators and the traditionalists, and fanned the flames of a quarrel which, in view of the worth of the two leaders--one of whom spelled genius and the other perfection--was destined to appear without sanction to the eyes of posterity."

### Coherence Analysis

I'll look for logical flow, structure, transitions, and overall organization:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text has two main sections (INTRODUCTION and EARLY YEARS), but the transition between them is abrupt and not clearly marked.
2. [LOGIC] The narrative jumps between different aspects of Meissonier's life and career without clear transitions.
3. [TRANSITION] The transition from the anecdote about Meissonier's dedication to realism to his early life is not smooth or clearly connected.
4. [CONTEXT] The out-of-place "A phone rang from across the room" disrupts the historical narrative and creates confusion about the text's context.
5. [ORGANIZATION] The text moves from describing Meissonier's artistic philosophy to his early life, but the connection between these sections is not clearly established.

### Final Ratings

For Fluency: The text has some punctuation and syntax issues, a jarring anachronism, and a few awkward phrases, but overall it remains largely readable. I would rate it a 4 out of 5.

For Coherence: The text has some structural issues and the out-of-place phone reference disrupts the narrative flow, but the overall content is logical and follows a clear progression from describing Meissonier's artistic philosophy to his early life. I would rate it a 4 out of 5.
