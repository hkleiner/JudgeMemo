Okay, let's tackle this. I need to rate the overall fluency and coherence based on the section-wise reports provided. 

Starting with Fluency. Each section has a score of 4.5. The issues mentioned are minor. In section 01, there are spelling issues with unrelated sentences disrupting flow. In section 02, syntax and lexicon issues are noted, like a sudden shift and British spelling. Since both sections are 4.5 and the problems are minor (like a few spelling or syntax errors), the overall fluency should still be high. Maybe 4.5 since there are a couple of issues but not major.

For Coherence, both sections also have 4.5. The issues here are about structure and transitions. Section 01 has sudden insertions of unrelated tech sentences breaking the logical flow. Section 02 mentions abrupt transitions and a jump between concepts needing more linkage. These are coherence issues but not severe enough to drop the score much. Since each section is 4.5 and the problems are present but not overwhelming, the overall coherence would also stay at 4.5. The text is mostly coherent but with a few noticeable hiccups in transitions and structure. 

I should make sure not to deduct more than the sections already have. The final scores should reflect the average considering the issues are consistent across sections but not too frequent or severe. So both Fluency and Coherence get 4.5.

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
