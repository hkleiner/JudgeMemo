Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice a few typos. For example, "I thertainly wath" should probably be "I certainly was." Also, "thnooping" is likely "snooping." There's a missing period after "I don't want your thtink near me." Additionally, "thtandard" should be "standard." These are spelling issues.

Looking at grammar and syntax, the sentence structure is mostly correct, but some phrases are awkward. For instance, "Ramsey gave him three hundred and seventy-five credits and said: 'Just see you make that go a long way supporting Sally and the kids.'" The phrasing here is a bit forced, but it's still understandable. Another example is "He watched the gambling for another hour or so without risking his few remaining credits." The use of "without risking" is okay, but the sentence could be smoother. However, these are minor and don't disrupt the flow much. 

Now, coherence. The text is a narrative that continues from the previous section. The transition seems smooth. The conversation between Ramsey and Englander makes sense, and the shift to Ramsey gambling and the encounter with the Irwadian is logically connected. The narrative flows from one scene to the next without abrupt jumps. There's a clear progression of events: Ramsey gives money to Englander, goes to gamble, faces a confrontation, and reflects on the situation. There's no repetition or confusing structure. The details about Irwadian culture and the context of planetarization are integrated into the story without being disruptive. The only minor issue might be the sudden introduction of the anthropologist's anecdote, but it's explained within the narrative and doesn't break the flow. 

So for fluency, the main issues are spelling errors and a couple of awkward phrases, but overall it's mostly fluent. For coherence, the text is well-structured with logical progression and smooth transitions. I'll rate fluency as 4 (minor issues) and coherence as 5 (highly coherent).
