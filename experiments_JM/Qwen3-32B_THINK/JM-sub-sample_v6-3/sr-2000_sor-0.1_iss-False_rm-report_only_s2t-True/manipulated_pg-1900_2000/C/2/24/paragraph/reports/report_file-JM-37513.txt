  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "The monitoring device recorded the metrics" (out-of-context technical phrase)
        • "A mobile hotspot activated" (disconnected technical statement)
        • "A smartwatch vibrated gently" (unrelated technological reference)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden insertion of technical devices ("monitoring device," "mobile hotspot," "smartwatch") disrupts narrative flow
        • Unexplained transitions between Spencer's philosophy and contemporary tech elements
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt shifts between philosophical discourse and modern technology references create confusion

Section section_02 (Chars 8947–12876):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 3.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Complex sentence structures with multiple subordinate clauses that make reading difficult
        • Unusual phrasing patterns like "the discussion of which, in the Nonconformist of 1842, constituted the first step from the life of an engineer to that other kind of life"
        • Archaic constructions like "if there be law it must at bottom be one law"
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Non-standard punctuation placement in sentences like "There is here, it may be said, no special reference to the organic and the superorganic"
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shifts between topics (social/political developments → philosophy of life/mind → evolution as universal principle → Spencer's formula in First Principles)
        • Disconnected segments discussing different aspects of Spencer's work without clear transitions
        • Jump from philosophical concepts to specific historical texts (Nonconformist letters, Preface to Howard Collins's Epitome) without clear connections
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Lacks clear organization or progression of ideas that would help readers follow the author's argument
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Uses complex philosophical terminology without sufficient explanation for general readers
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transitions between paragraphs discussing different aspects of Spencer's philosophy
