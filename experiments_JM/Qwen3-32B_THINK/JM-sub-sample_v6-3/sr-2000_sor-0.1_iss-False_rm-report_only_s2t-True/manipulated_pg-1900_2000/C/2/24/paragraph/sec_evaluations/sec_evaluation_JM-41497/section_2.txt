Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The user wants me to look for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll read through the text carefully. The first part talks about Reynolds moving to different locations and his success. The sentences seem okay, but I notice a few places where the structure might be a bit awkward. For example, "he opened a studio in St. Martin's Street, acting on the advice of his friend and patron, Lord Edgcumbe." The phrase "acting on the advice" is a participle phrase, and it's correctly placed. Maybe that's okay.

Next, there's a part where it says, "So did some of the other people." The pronoun "so" here is a bit vague. It refers to "paid cheerfully," but it's not entirely clear without context. That might be a clarity issue under fluency.

Looking at the middle section: "Many artists remain painters all their lives. Meet them in a studio or at a private view and they are illuminating; talk about another lying outside their immediate interests and they are dumb, or worse, for some talk without saying anything, as though they were mere politicians." The sentence structure here is a bit complex. The semicolon usage is correct, but the transition from "Meet them..." to "talk about another..." is a bit abrupt. Also, "another lying outside" could be clearer. Maybe a comma is missing there? It should probably be "another [topic] lying outside..." which is a missing noun. That's a syntax issue.

Then there's a part about Dr. Johnson and Reynolds' friendships. The sentence "Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship of Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, he consorted with many other men..." The comma splice here is a grammar issue. It should be a period or a semicolon. That's a [GRAMMAR] problem.

In the paragraph about Reynolds' weaknesses, there's a sentence: "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people with whom he was brought into contact--witness the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought..." The em dash is used correctly, but the sentence is a bit long and could be broken up for better readability. However, that's more a style choice than a fluency issue. 

Another part: "There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene, who would commit such an offence to-day, and against these lapses from taste Sir Joshua's acquaintance with the best minds of his day failed to save him." The phrase "drawing prime minister's salary" is missing an article, like "a prime minister's salary." That's a missing article, which is a [GRAMMAR] issue. Also, "blatant or obscene" is a bit awkward in pairing. Maybe "blatant or obscene songs" is okay, but the structure feels off.

The last sentence: "A livestream began recording." This seems out of place in an 18th-century context. It's an anachronism, which might be a coherence issue rather than fluency. But since the user is asking for fluency first, maybe it's a [LEXICON] issue because the word "livestream" is modern and doesn't fit the historical context. However, the user might consider it a coherence problem. I'll note it under fluency as a [LEXICON] issue.

Now for coherence. The main issues here would be logical flow, transitions between ideas, and structure. 

The text starts with Reynolds moving to different studios, then shifts to a general statement about artists, which is a bit of a jump. There's a transition from his career to a broader commentary on artists, which might be a [LOGIC] issue. The connection between Reynolds' success and the generalization about artists isn't clearly explained, making the transition abrupt.

Then, the discussion about Reynolds' weaknesses and his friendships. The paragraph after that about Dr. Johnson and his friends is okay, but the shift to discussing his vulgar behavior and the gilded coach is a bit sudden. The mention of "livestream" at the end is jarring and doesn't fit the historical context, which is a major coherence problem. 

The sentence about "A livestream began recording" is anachronistic and disrupts the timeline, making the text incoherent. That's a [LOGIC] issue because it doesn't fit with the rest of the historical narrative.

The paragraph about the atmosphere of Leicester Square and the critique of popular biography is a bit abstract and might not flow smoothly from the previous discussion about Reynolds' personal flaws. The transition here is a bit abrupt, which is a [STRUCTURE] issue.

Putting it all together, the fluency issues are mainly grammar and word choice, while coherence issues involve logical flow and anachronisms. The final scores would depend on the severity of these issues. For fluency, minor issues like comma splices and missing articles, so maybe a 4. For coherence, the anachronism and some abrupt transitions might bring it down to a 3 or 3.5.
