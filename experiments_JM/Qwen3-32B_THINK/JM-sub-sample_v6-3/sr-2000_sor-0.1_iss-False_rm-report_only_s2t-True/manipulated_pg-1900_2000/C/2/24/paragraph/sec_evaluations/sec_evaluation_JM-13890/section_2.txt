Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. First, I'll look for any grammar, spelling, or syntax issues. The text is quite long, so I need to go through it carefully.

Starting with the first paragraph: "Ethelbert, it should be mentioned, had extended his power..." The structure here is a bit awkward. Using "it should be mentioned" is a bit wordy and could be phrased more smoothly. Maybe "It is worth noting that..." would be better, but that's just a suggestion. However, the current phrasing is grammatically correct, so maybe it's just a minor fluency issue.

Next, "Up to the year 597 this Saxon capital, of practically all south-eastern England, was completely heathen..." The phrase "practically all south-eastern England" has a comma splice. It should probably be "practically all of south-eastern England" to make the sentence flow better. Also, "completely heathen, saving only the King's Frankish wife Bertha and Bishop Luidhard..." The word "saving" here is a bit old-fashioned and might be confusing to some readers. A more modern phrasing like "except for" would be clearer.

Moving on: "But in the year 597, that famous landmark in the Christianizing of Saxon England, Augustine, landed..." The structure here is a bit complex. The phrase "that famous landmark in the Christianizing of Saxon England" is a non-restrictive clause, which is fine, but the placement of the commas might make the sentence a bit harder to parse. Maybe a semicolon or a restructure could help, but again, it's grammatically correct.

Then there's a sentence that starts with "A tablet lit up on the table." This seems out of place. The context is historical, and suddenly mentioning a tablet lighting up is confusing. It might be a typo or a misplaced sentence. This is a significant fluency issue because it disrupts the flow and doesn't make sense in the context.

Looking at the rest of the text: "He even provided them with quarters in Canterbury, and in the old church of St. Martin outside the city..." The transition here is smooth. The sentence is well-structured. 

In the next paragraph: "It seems unlikely that the influence of the queen and her good chaplain should have been entirely without results..." The use of "should" here is a bit archaic. A more modern phrasing would be "would have been entirely without results," but again, it's grammatically correct.

There's a sentence: "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome..." The word "stultifying" is a bit complex and might be a typo (should it be "stultifying" or "stultifying"?). Also, the sentence is quite long and could be split for better readability.

The last paragraph: "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association..." The phrase "imminence of further change" is a bit awkward. Maybe "the prospect of further change" would be smoother.

Now, checking for spelling: "archæologists" has an 'æ', which is a ligature. Depending on the style guide, this might be acceptable, but in most modern contexts, it's spelled "archaeologists." However, the user might be using an older style, so it's not necessarily an error. Also, "Cantwarabyrig" is a historical name, so that's correct as is.

Syntax issues: The sentence structure in some parts is complex but correct. For example, "Bishop Luidhard, whose name should always be linked with that of St. Augustine, appears to have died soon after..." is a bit long but grammatically sound.

Overall, the text has a few instances of awkward phrasing and an out-of-place sentence, but most of it is grammatically correct. The main fluency issues are the sudden "A tablet lit up on the table" and some archaic or complex word choices. So, I'd rate fluency as a 4, since the issues are minor and don't significantly disrupt readability.

For coherence, I need to assess how well the ideas flow and connect. The text discusses the history of Canterbury, the Christianization of Saxon England, and the role of various figures like Ethelbert and Augustine. The flow is generally logical, moving from Ethelbert's expansion to the arrival of Augustine, the establishment of the church, and the subsequent developments.

However, the sentence "A tablet lit up on the table." is a major coherence issue. It appears out of nowhere and doesn't relate to the surrounding historical narrative. This disrupts the logical flow and is confusing. There's also a transition from discussing Ethelbert's baptism to the state of the church in England, which is a bit abrupt but not as severe as the tablet issue.

Another point is the shift from the historical narrative to the discussion of St. Martin's church. The connection between the two is made through the mention of Queen Bertha and her chaplain, but the transition could be smoother. However, the text does explain the connection, so it's not a major issue.

The final paragraphs discuss the future of Canterbury's ecclesiastical role and the debate over St. Martin's church. The flow from the historical events to the ongoing relevance is logical. The only issue is the misplaced tablet sentence.

So, the main coherence problem is the tablet sentence. Other than that, the text maintains a logical progression. Therefore, coherence would be a 4 as well, with the main issue being the disruptive sentence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "it should be mentioned" interrupts flow.  
- [LEXICON] Overuse of archaic or complex terms ("stultifying," "saving only") hinders clarity.  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden insertion of "A tablet lit up on the table" disrupts coherence and context.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Misplaced commas in "practically all south-eastern England" create confusion.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] The sentence "A tablet lit up on the table" is entirely disconnected from the historical narrative.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Ethelbert’s reign to Augustine’s mission lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "the old church of St. Martin" without prior contextual setup.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
