Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a text and wants me to rate it on fluency and coherence using the Likert scale. I need to follow the steps they outlined.

First, for fluency, I should look for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me read through the text again. The first part is about Mr. Arthur Davis and his contributions. I notice some sentences are a bit long but not necessarily incorrect. For example, "Mr. Arthur Davis, in whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures..." â€“ that structure is a bit awkward. Maybe a passive voice issue. Also, "He was able to put his learning to good use." That's okay, but "put to good use" is a common phrase. 

Looking further, there's a part where it says "A signal booster amplified the stream." That seems out of place. The context is about language revival, so this might be a typo or an error. Then "The nanobots completed their diagnostics." Again, this feels like it's from a different context. These lines don't fit the rest of the text. Maybe they're test sentences or errors. 

In terms of coherence, the text starts with Arthur Davis's life, his work, and then shifts to discuss ritual languages and their revival, using examples like Hebrew, Church Slavonic, etc. Then it moves to the chapter on the "Chosen People," discussing historical and modern views. The transition between these sections is abrupt. The first part is about Davis, then a general discussion on languages, then a new chapter. The connection between the sections isn't smooth. 

There's also a shift in topic from Hebrew's revival to Germanism and anti-Semitism. The example about German kings talking six thousand years ago is factually incorrect, which might confuse the reader. The text jumps from one example to another without clear transitions. 

For fluency issues, the main problems are the two out-of-place sentences ("A signal booster..." and "The nanobots...") and some awkward phrasing. These are isolated but noticeable. For coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions between sections and the inclusion of factually incorrect statements that disrupt the logical flow. 

Fluency score: There are a few issues but the text is mostly readable. Maybe a 4.5. Coherence: The transitions are problematic, especially between the first and second chapters, and some examples are confusing. That might be a 3.5. I need to check if the issues are severe enough to lower the scores. The two sentences in the first chapter seem like they might be errors or test lines. If they're considered mistakes, they affect fluency. The coherence issues are more about the structure and transitions, which are noticeable but not too severe to make the text hard to follow. So final scores: Fluency 4.5 and Coherence 3.5.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "In whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures..." (awkward passive construction)  
- [LEXICON] "A signal booster amplified the stream" (contextually irrelevant, likely misplaced)  
- [LEXICON] "The nanobots completed their diagnostics" (contextually irrelevant, likely misplaced)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Arthur Davis's biography to a general discussion of ritual languages with no clear connection  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed shift from Hebrew revival to Germanism/anti-Semitism examples without transitional context  
- [CLARITY] Confusing chronological error: "six thousand years ago the world by Hebrew reckoning had not been created" (misleading phrasing)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
