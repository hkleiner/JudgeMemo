Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to determine the final Coherence and Fluency scores for the text based on the provided section-wise evaluation report. Let's start by analyzing each section's issues and how they might affect the overall scores.

For Coherence:
Section 01 has a score of 3.5. The issues include sudden, unexplained technological references disrupting the historical narrative, abrupt shifts between family chronology and Rosa's artistic development, and inconsistent temporal markers. These issues suggest that the flow of the narrative is somewhat disrupted, making the story less coherent.

Section 02 has a higher score of 4.0. The issues here are a sudden insertion of a smartwatch notification in a historical context and a vague reference to "Later on" without clear temporal markers. These are less severe than the issues in section 01 but still affect coherence. The sudden insertion is jarring, and the vague reference could confuse readers about the timeline.

Considering both sections, the main recurring issues for coherence are disruptions in the narrative flow due to anachronistic elements and unclear transitions. Section 01's issues are more severe, leading to a lower score, while section 02's issues are less severe but still present. The overall coherence would be somewhere between 3.5 and 4.0. Given that section 01 is more problematic, I might lean towards a lower score, but since section 02 is better, it's a balance. The most impactful problems are the disruptions in narrative flow, which are more significant in section 01. So, I think the final Coherence Score would be around 3.5, as the issues in section 01 are more severe and affect the overall coherence more.

For Fluency:
Section 01 has a score of 4.0. The issues include the use of archaic or overly formal language, long complex sentences with nested clauses, and overuse of semicolons and colons. These issues make the text slightly harder to read but don't make it difficult to understand. The fluency is mostly good but has minor issues.

Section 02 has a higher score of 4.5. The issues here are an anachronistic reference to a "smartwatch" and awkward phrasing in one sentence. These are minor issues that don't significantly impact the overall fluency. The overall fluency in this section is better than in section 01.

Considering both sections, the main issues for fluency are the use of archaic language and complex sentences in section 01, which are more impactful than the minor issues in section 02. The overall fluency would be between 4.0 and 4.5. Since section 01 has more issues but is still at 4.0, and section 02 is better at 4.5, the average might be around 4.25. However, since the issues in section 01 are more numerous and affect the fluency more, I might round down to 4.0. But given that section 02 is better, I might consider a score slightly higher than 4.0. The most impactful issues are the archaic language and complex sentences in section 01, which are more significant than the minor issues in section 02. So, the final Fluency Score would be around 4.0 or 4.25. Since the instructions allow for half-points, I'll go with 4.0 as the main issues in section 01 are more impactful, and the overall fluency is mostly good with minor issues.
