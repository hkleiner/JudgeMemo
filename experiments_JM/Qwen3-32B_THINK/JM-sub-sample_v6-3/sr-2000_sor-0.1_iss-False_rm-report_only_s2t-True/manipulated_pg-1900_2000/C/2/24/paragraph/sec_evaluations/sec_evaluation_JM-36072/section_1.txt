Let me carefully evaluate the text for fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Evaluation:

I need to look for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice:
- [GRAMMAR] "The prophet or pioneer, after being at first declared to be unintelligible or absurd, has a brief spell of popularity, after which he is said to be conventional, and then antiquated." (The sentence is a bit awkward with the repetition of "after" and the structure is a bit complex, but it's grammatically correct.)
- [GRAMMAR] "The great man is linked to his age by his weakest side; and his epigoni, who are not great men, caricature his message and make it ridiculous." (The semicolon usage is appropriate, but the sentence is complex and a bit awkward.)
- [GRAMMAR] "The German Von Eicken found, in this tendency of all human movements to provoke violent reactions, the master key of history." (This sentence is grammatically correct but has a very long introductory phrase that makes it a bit unwieldy.)
- [GRAMMAR] "Tocqueville caps this by saying that the more successful a democracy is in levelling a population, the less will be the resistance which the next despotism will encounter." (The sentence is grammatically correct but a bit complex and awkward.)
- [GRAMMAR] "The reign of Queen Victoria, which I have chosen to mark the limits of my survey to-day, covered the latter half of this saeculum mirabile, the most wonderful century in human history. A touchscreen panel showed static." (The "A touchscreen panel showed static" at the end is out of place and seems like an error or misplaced sentence.)
- [GRAMMAR] "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch." (This is another out-of-place sentence at the end of a paragraph.)
- [GRAMMAR] "Let us spend five minutes in picturing to ourselves the English nation in a condition of stable equilibrium, as it was in the eighteenth century." (This sentence is grammatically correct but a bit awkward with the phrase "in picturing to ourselves.")
- [GRAMMAR] "So each parish provided for its own needs." (This is grammatically correct but a bit abrupt after the detailed description.)
- [GRAMMAR] "Families like that of Dean Colet, who was one of twenty-two children, among whom he was the only one to grow up, remained common till the middle of the eighteenth century." (This sentence is grammatically correct but has some awkward phrasing.)
- [GRAMMAR] "They were not content, like their successors to-day, to load their tables with magazines and newspapers." (This sentence is grammatically correct but has an awkward comparison.)

Overall, the text is mostly fluent and well-structured, but contains a few grammatical issues and awkward phrasings that could be improved. The out-of-place sentences at the end of paragraphs are particularly problematic.

## Coherence Evaluation:

I need to assess how the text unfolds as a whole, looking at logical sequencing, non-repetitive ideas, smooth transitions, clarity of progression, and narrative consistency.

Looking through the text:
- [LOGIC] The text starts with a general discussion of historical movements and then moves to specific examples, which is a logical progression.
- [LOGIC] The discussion of the Industrial Revolution and French Revolution is well-integrated with the broader historical analysis.
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing the Industrial Revolution to "A touchscreen panel showed static" is jarring and breaks the coherence of the text.
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing the English nation in the 18th century to "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch" is also jarring and breaks the coherence.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a clear structure with an introduction, several thematic sections, and a conclusion, but the placement of the out-of-place sentences disrupts this structure.
- [TRANSITION] The transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth, but the out-of-place sentences create abrupt shifts that disrupt the flow.
- [CLARITY] The overall argument is clear and well-developed, but the out-of-place sentences create confusion about the text's purpose and context.

The text is mostly coherent with a logical progression of ideas, but the out-of-place sentences at the end of paragraphs significantly disrupt the coherence.

## Final Ratings:

For Fluency:
The text is mostly fluent with only a few grammatical issues and awkward phrasings. The main issue is the out-of-place sentences at the end of paragraphs. Based on the scale, I would rate this a 4.5. The text is generally well-written and fluent, but the out-of-place sentences are notable issues.

For Coherence:
The text has a clear structure and logical progression of ideas, but the out-of-place sentences significantly disrupt the coherence. Based on the scale, I would rate this a 4.0. The text is mostly coherent with only a few disruptions to the flow.

Let me double check my assessment:

Fluency: The text is mostly fluent with only a few grammatical issues and awkward phrasings. The main issue is the out-of-place sentences at the end of paragraphs. These are significant issues that affect the flow of the text. I think a 4 is more appropriate than 4.5 because these issues are more disruptive to the reading experience than I initially thought.

Coherence: The text has a clear structure and logical progression of ideas, but the out-of-place sentences significantly disrupt the coherence. I believe this is a 3.5 rather than a 4 because the disruptions are more significant than I initially thought.

Actually, after reconsidering, I think the text is more coherent than I initially assessed. The main argument flows well and the disruptions, while noticeable, don't completely derail the overall coherence. I'll rate it a 4 for coherence.

For fluency, while there are some awkward phrasings, the text is generally well-written and the main issue is the out-of-place sentences. I'll rate it a 4 for fluency as well.
