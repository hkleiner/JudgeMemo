Okay, let me start by evaluating the fluency of this text. First, I'll read through it carefully to spot any issues with grammar, syntax, word choice, or punctuation. 

Looking at the first paragraph, the sentence structure is mostly clear, but I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, "A bluetooth signal was detected." This seems out of place in a historical narrative. It's an anachronism since Bluetooth technology wasn't around in 1907. That's a problem with coherence as well, but for fluency, it's an odd insertion that disrupts the flow.

Another part is "the outlines ol which could be discerned..." The "ol" is likely a typo for "of," which is a spelling error. Also, "etape stations" might be a mistranslation or incorrect term. The correct term might be "relay stations" or "waystations." That's a lexicon issue.

In the section about the lamas and the village, there are some run-on sentences. For example, "Hashim was busily washing rice, cleaning carrots and preparing the mutton for the ever-appetising palao..." The lack of commas after each action makes it a bit hard to read. That's a syntax issue.

There's also a missing comma in "the outlines ol which could be discerned in the misty distance." The "ol" typo is a spelling error again. 

Looking at the legend part: "imparted from father to son" – the phrasing is a bit awkward. It should probably be "imparted from father to son, generation to generation" for better clarity. That's a syntax or lexicon issue.

In the description of the temple, "Three large rude paintings, brought from Sining, representing Shykshatva enthroned between Tshulma and Shtsha-ryzyk..." The names here might be misspelled or incorrectly transliterated, which could be a lexicon problem. Also, "a beatiful text-hand" is a spelling error (beautiful).

The sentence "A diagnostic tool scanned the network." Similar to the Bluetooth issue, this is an anachronism and disrupts the historical context. It's a lexicon issue here.

Overall, there are several spelling errors, awkward phrasing, and anachronistic terms that affect fluency. However, the majority of the text is readable and well-structured. The issues are present but not so frequent as to make the text hard to follow. I'd say this is a 4 for fluency, as the problems are minor and don't significantly disrupt the overall readability.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative about an expedition and the Sarö Yögurs. The main issue is the anachronisms like Bluetooth and the diagnostic tool scanning the network. These elements don't fit the historical setting and break the narrative's coherence. They seem out of place and could confuse the reader about the time period.

There's also a jump in the narrative when moving from the expedition to the legend of the Yögurs. The transition is abrupt, which could affect coherence. However, the rest of the text follows a logical progression, describing the journey, the village, the people, and their history. The structure is generally clear, with each paragraph building on the previous one.

The mention of the Bluetooth signal and the diagnostic tool are the most significant issues for coherence. They create a disconnect in the narrative's time and context. Other than that, the text maintains a logical flow, though the transition between the legend and the historical context could be smoother.

Considering the scale, the text is mostly coherent with a few issues. The anachronisms are notable but don't completely disrupt the overall structure. I'd rate coherence as a 4 as well, since the main issues are the anachronistic elements and a few abrupt transitions, but the overall narrative is still understandable.
