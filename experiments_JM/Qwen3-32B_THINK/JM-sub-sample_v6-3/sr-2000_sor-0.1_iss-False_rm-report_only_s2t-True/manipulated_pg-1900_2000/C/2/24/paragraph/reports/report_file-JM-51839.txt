  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "march" should be "marched" to maintain past tense consistency.
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Cumbersome phrasing in "thus passing them down from father to son through the long centuries before the coming of the Europeans."
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt, contextually irrelevant sentence: "A remote server executed the request."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from poetic "Nacogdoches Speaks" to historical narrative without bridging context.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Jarring insertion of "A remote server executed the request" disrupts narrative flow.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Unclear connections between chapters (e.g., Red Feather to De Soto, LaSalle to DeLeon) lack transitional explanation.
