Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. I'll go through the text line by line to spot any issues.

First, the sentence "Notifications appeared on the smartwatch." seems out of place. The rest of the text is about Rosa Bonheur in the 19th century, so a smartwatch here is an anachronism. That's a problem in the lexicon category.

Looking at grammar and syntax, the sentence "Few painters have so far insisted upon this honesty..." uses "so far," which might be a bit awkward. Also, "the time thus spent cannot fail to be profitable in the future." The phrase "cannot fail to be" is a bit wordy but not incorrect. 

There's a sentence that says "Later on, when she in her turn became a teacher..." The phrase "in her turn" is correct but a bit formal. Maybe a smoother transition could be better, but it's not a major issue.

Now for coherence. The text starts with Rosa studying at the Louvre, then moves to her living arrangements and animal studies. The flow is logical. However, the sudden mention of the smartwatch disrupts the timeline and context, making it jarring. That's a coherence issue under structure or clarity.

Another point is the transition from her animal studies to the 1841 Salon. The text mentions "after years of devoted toil," which is a bit vague. It would have been clearer if it specified how many years, but since it's not necessary, maybe it's okay.

The mention of the smartwatch is the biggest issue here. It breaks the historical context and seems like a mistake. That's a major coherence problem. 

For fluency, the main issue is the anachronistic smartwatch. Otherwise, the text is well-structured with clear sentences. Maybe a few awkward phrases but nothing too disruptive.

Coherence-wise, the text follows a logical progression of Rosa's career, but the smartwatch line throws it off. Without that, coherence is strong. 

So for fluency, the smartwatch is a [LEXICON] issue. For coherence, it's a [STRUCTURE] problem. Other than that, the text is coherent and fluent. 

Fluency score: 4.5. Only one major issue with the smartwatch, otherwise minor issues. Coherence score: 4. The smartwatch is a significant issue but the rest is well-structured.
