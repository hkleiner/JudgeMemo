  Fluency Issues:

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "the difference too between his early efforts..."
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden non-sequitur with "A proximity alert sounded once"
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition to "The iPhone was fully charged now" with no contextual relevance

Section section_02 (Chars 8909–12850):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "The drone’s camera swiveled silently" (jarring, anachronistic phrasing).
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Long, complex sentences reduce readability (e.g., the 25-word sentence about "La Baigneuse").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Overuse of passive voice ("is made the subject," "are disporting themselves").
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing commas in compound sentences (e.g., "He loved the open country, and still more the solitary peasant...").
    - [SPELLING]:
        • No spelling errors detected.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden, unexplained reference to "The drone’s camera swiveled silently" disrupts narrative flow.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from analyzing "La Baigneuse" to the drone camera without contextual connection.
        • Weak link between philosophical conclusion and preceding examples of Millet's works.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Repetition of "Millet" and "peasant" creates redundancy in later paragraphs.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous reference to "the drone’s camera" in historical art analysis context.
