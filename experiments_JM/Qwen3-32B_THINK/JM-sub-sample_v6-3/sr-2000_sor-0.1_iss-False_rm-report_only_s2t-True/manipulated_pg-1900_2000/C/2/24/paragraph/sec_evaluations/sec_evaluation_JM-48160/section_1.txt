Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. The user wants me to identify issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. I'll go through the text line by line.

First, the chapter title is "LIFE IN THE WAR ZONE" followed by "CHAPTER: INVADING THE WAR ZONE - PARIS, August 8, 1916." The date format is a bit inconsistent with the rest of the text, but maybe that's just the style. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "France to-day is sharply divided..." The hyphen in "to-day" is an old-fashioned spelling that might not be an issue in a historical text. The sentence structure is okay, but the use of semicolons and commas is correct. 

Next, "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit..." The term "sauf conduit" is a French term, which is correctly used here. The sentence is a bit long but still readable. 

In the second paragraph, "For nearly three months now I have felt like an inverted snob..." The phrase "inverted snob" is a bit confusing. Maybe the author means a snob in reverse, but the term is not commonly used. The sentence structure is okay, but the word choice is a bit odd. 

The sentence "If you bring even one letter to society..." The phrase "one letter" might be a typo for "one trait" or "one aspect." The sentence is a bit awkward. 

In the third paragraph: "I made no attempt to enter this proscribed region for six or seven weeks..." The use of "six or seven weeks" is a bit vague but acceptable. The sentence is clear. 

The next part: "One referred me to a Frenchman of great influence who has a special liking for Americans." The verb "has" is in present tense, but the context is past, which is inconsistent. It should be "had." 

In the section about the duchess: "She asked one of its principal Secretaries to meet me at breakfast..." The word "Secretaries" should be lowercase unless it's a proper noun. 

The sentence "I told him that, as I had agreed to do the publicity work for this oeuvre..." The word "oeuvre" is correctly used here. 

In the part about the permis de séjour: "I received consolatory promises and nothing more." The phrase "consolatory promises" is a bit odd; maybe "comforting" is better, but it's still acceptable. 

The sentence "We all do when the War Office summons. Royalty itself would not be considered." The transition here is abrupt. The connection between the two sentences is weak. 

In the section about the Vice-President: "We all do when the War Office summons. Royalty itself would not be considered." The sentence structure is awkward. The phrase "Royalty itself would not be considered" is confusing. 

The part about the battlefield: "Imagine vast fields of waving grain broken irregularly, but with pathetic frequency, by drooping and faded flags..." The sentence is long but still readable. The use of "pathetic frequency" is a bit jarring. 

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a narrative about the author's attempts to enter the war zone. The flow is generally good, but there are some issues. The transition from discussing the duchess to the permis de séjour is a bit abrupt. The mention of the speech recognition unit and home assistant seems out of place and might be a typo or error. Similarly, the line about the carnet rouge and the list of cities is clear, but the sudden mention of "taubes" (which I assume refers to aircraft) is a bit confusing without context. The text jumps between different locations and bureaucratic processes, which might disrupt the flow. The conclusion about the battlefield is well-described but could be more smoothly connected to the previous sections.

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with word choice and tense consistency, but the text is mostly readable. Coherence is generally good, but there are a few abrupt transitions and some unclear references. The scores should reflect these observations.
