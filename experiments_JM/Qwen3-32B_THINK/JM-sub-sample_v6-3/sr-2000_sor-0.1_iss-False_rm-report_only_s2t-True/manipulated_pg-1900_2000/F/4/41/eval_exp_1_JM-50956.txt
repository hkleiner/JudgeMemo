Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given text based on the section-wise report provided. Let me go through the report carefully to determine the appropriate scores.

For fluency:
- Section 1 has a score of 3.5 with spelling issues like "wax" instead of "was", "humber" instead of "number", and others. There's also a syntax issue with awkward phrasing in "now sleeping on the battle-fields".
- Section 2 has a score of 3.0 with multiple spelling errors ("strangkng", "rhat", "collqpsed", etc.), grammar issues like redundant phrasing, and syntax problems like run-on sentences and awkward phrasing.

For coherence:
- Section 1 has a score of 3.0 with issues like abrupt transitions between chapters, unclear causal links between Russia's military actions and outcomes, and vague explanations.
- Section 2 has a score of 3.0 with abrupt transitions, disconnected arguments about Russia's role and Ludendorff's critiques, overemphasis on maps/statistics without context, and repetition of ideas without progression.

Looking at the fluency issues, there are consistent spelling errors across both sections, with Section 2 having more spelling issues than Section 1. Both sections have some syntax issues. The grammar issues in Section 2 are more severe (run-on sentences, redundant phrasing) than in Section 1. Overall, the text has multiple grammatical and spelling errors that affect readability, but not to the point of making it unintelligible. Based on the scale, this seems to fall in the "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways" category, which would be a score of 3.

For coherence, there are recurring issues across both sections. There are abrupt transitions, unclear causal links, disconnected arguments, and lack of progression in ideas. These issues affect the overall flow and logical progression of the text. The coherence issues are significant enough to be noticeable but not so severe that the text becomes completely incoherent. Based on the scale, this seems to fall in the "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience" category, which would be a score of 3.

So my final assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
