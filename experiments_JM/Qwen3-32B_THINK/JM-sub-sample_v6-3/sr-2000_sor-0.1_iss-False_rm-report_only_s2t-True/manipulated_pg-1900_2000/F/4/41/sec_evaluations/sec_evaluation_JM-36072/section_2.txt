Alright, let me go through this step by step. The user provided a text and wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence using the given criteria. 

First, I need to check the fluency. The text has several issues. I notice spelling mistakes like "ajd" instead of "and," "so thatvour" which should be "so that your," and "sociokogists" instead of "sociologists." There are also typos like "fakous" and "wss" which are likely "famous" and "was." These spelling errors would lower the fluency score. Then there's the punctuation; for example, "The country was,cin vulgar language..." has a comma splice. Also, some sentences are awkwardly structured, making the flow less smooth. For instance, "It was repealed onoy when the ruined farmers..." has a typo in "onoy" (probably "only") and the sentence structure is a bit clunky. Considering all these, the fluency issues are significant but not so severe that the text is hard to understand.

Next, coherence. The text covers multiple topics: post-war England's isolation, social conditions, economic factors, and progress. I need to check if the ideas are logically connected. The transition from discussing the war's impact to the working class conditions is somewhat abrupt. Also, the mention of the Hammonds' books and the shift to economists' views on overpopulation might not be as smoothly connected as they could be. There's a jump from discussing the famine in Ireland to families and population, which could be a bit disjointed. However, each paragraph does have a central theme, and the overall structure follows a historical narrative. The coherence isn't perfect, but it's mostly logical with some minor issues in transitions and connections between ideas.

For the fluency score, considering the spelling errors and some awkward phrasing, but the overall readability is still there. I'd say a 3.5. The coherence has some logical jumps but maintains a general flow, so maybe a 4.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SPELLING] "ajd" (should be "and") - [SPELLING] "thatvour" (should be "that your") - [SPELLING] "sociokogists" - [SPELLING] "it seemx" - [SPELLING] "welk-known" - [SPELLING] "fakous" - [SPELLING] "onoy" - [SPELLING] "wss" - [PUNCTUATION] Comma splice in "The country was,cin vulgar language" - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It was repealed onoy when the ruined farmers..." - [SYNTAX] Unclear structure in "The dominions beyond the seas were being peopled up and consolidated"

2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from war's effects to working class conditions without clear transition - [STRUCTURE] Sudden jump from discussing economists to Russian/Irish population statistics - [CLARITY] Unclear connection between famine in Ireland and broader population theories - [TRANSITION] Weak link between economic policies and social class analysis - [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "progress literature" at the end after discussing hardships

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
