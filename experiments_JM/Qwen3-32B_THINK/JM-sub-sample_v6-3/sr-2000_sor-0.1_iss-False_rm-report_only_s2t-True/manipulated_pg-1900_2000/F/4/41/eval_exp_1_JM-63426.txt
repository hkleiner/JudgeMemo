Alright, let's analyze the evaluation report to determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency.

For Coherence:
- Both sections scored 3.5 for Coherence.
- Section 01 had issues with:
  - Abrupt transitions between the analytical introduction and biographical narrative
  - Jarring shift from European art movements to an American context
  - Sudden jump from a father's illness to Boston trip and subsequent events
  - Confusing sequence in the first chapter's historical context
  - Unclear reference to "Kelmscott House"
- Section 02 had issues with:
  - Narrative jumps between different time periods without clear transitions
  - Confusing sentences lacking clear connections to the main narrative
  - Historical events mentioned without proper context
  - Abrupt shifts from personal experiences to broader commentary
  - Unclear timeline and connections between work experiences and other elements

For Fluency:
- Both sections scored 2.5 for Fluency.
- Section 01 had issues with:
  - Spelling errors like "thecopening," "xoor," "hasnâ€™y," etc.
  - Run-on sentence structure and choppiness in repetitive short sentences
  - Improper use of punctuation with dashes instead of commas/periods
- Section 02 had numerous spelling errors like "yhe" instead of "the," "Eveey" instead of "Every," etc.
  - Grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in several sentences
  - Inconsistent punctuation and spacing issues

Looking at the recurring issues:
- Coherence: Both sections have problems with abrupt transitions, unclear connections, and confusing sequences. These issues are consistent across both sections.
- Fluency: Both sections have significant spelling errors, grammatical issues, and awkward phrasing. The errors are numerous and affect readability.

For Coherence:
- The text shows some organization but has noticeable issues with transitions and logical flow.
- Given the consistent problems across both sections, a score of 3.5 seems appropriate - it's generally coherent but with noticeable issues that affect the reading experience.

For Fluency:
- The text has frequent grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing in both sections.
- The issues are significant enough to make comprehension difficult at times.
- Based on the scale, this seems to align with a score of 2.5 - the text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure, though some segments are clear.

Final assessment:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
