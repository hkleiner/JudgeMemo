Alright, let's go through this evaluation report and determine the final fluency and coherence scores for the text.

For fluency, I'll look at the recurring issues across both sections:
- Spelling errors are present in both sections, with several misspellings in each section (8 in section_01 and 9 in section_02).
- Grammar issues are noted in both sections, including missing spaces and awkward phrasing.
- Syntax problems appear in both sections, with missing spaces and unnatural phrasing.

The scores for fluency are 3.5 in both sections, indicating that the text is "generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways."

For coherence, I'll examine the issues:
- Transition problems occur in both sections, with abrupt shifts between scenes or ideas.
- Logic issues are present in both sections, with unclear connections between different parts of the narrative.
- Clarity issues appear in both sections, with ambiguous references and unclear concepts.
- Structure issues are mentioned in section_02, with abrupt transitions between different perspectives.

The scores for coherence are 4.0 in section_01 and 3.5 in section_02. Section_01 is "mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts," while section_02 is "generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience."

Considering the overall pattern of issues and scores:
For fluency, the text consistently has multiple grammatical, spelling, and syntax issues across both sections. These issues are significant enough to interrupt the flow and clarity of the text in noticeable ways. Given the consistent 3.5 scores in both sections and the recurring issues, I would give a final fluency score of 3.5.

For coherence, the text shows a decline from 4.0 to 3.5 between sections, indicating increasing problems with transitions, logic, and structure. The issues are noticeable but not completely disruptive to understanding. Given this pattern, I would give a final coherence score of 3.5.

So my assessment would be:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
