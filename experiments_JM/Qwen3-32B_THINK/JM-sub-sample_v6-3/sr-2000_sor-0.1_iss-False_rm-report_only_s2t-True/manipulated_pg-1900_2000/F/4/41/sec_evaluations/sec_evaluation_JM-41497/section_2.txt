Alright, I need to evaluate the fluency and coherence of this current section. Let me start by looking at the fluency issues. The user wants me to identify problems in syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text for any obvious errors. I notice a few typos: "Devonshirr" in the previous section, but that's in the context segment, which I should ignore. In the current section, the word "gis" is used instead of "his," and "lwn" instead of "own." There's also "cfedit" instead of "credit," and "cbest" instead of "best." These are spelling mistakes. 

Looking at grammar, there's a sentence that says "he consorted with many other men who mace some mark..." The verb "mace" should be "made." Another part: "men who mace some mark in the world of thought" – that's a grammatical error. 

Phrasing and word choice: "he had human weaknesses to live down" – "live down" is a bit awkward. Also, "There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene..." The phrase "drawing prime minister's salary" might be confusing. It should probably be "drawing a prime minister's salary." 

Punctuation: The sentence "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company, even though we may think in our heart of hearts that the benefit of the inspiration was not without serious drawbacks." The comma after "company" is correct, but the overall structure is a bit long. 

Now for coherence. The text is a biographical essay, so it should flow logically. The transition from Reynolds' personal life to his relationships with other artists and then to his weaknesses might be a bit abrupt. The paragraph about Dr. Johnson and others is well-connected, but the shift to discussing his weaknesses and then to Leicester Square's atmosphere might not be as smooth. 

There's a part where it talks about Reynolds' vulgarity and his sister's gilded coach. This connects to the previous discussion of his weaknesses, but the connection could be clearer. Also, the mention of modern comparisons like "Lion Comique" and "lady of the music halls" might be a bit jarring since the rest is historical. 

The last paragraph discusses the atmosphere of Leicester Square and the faults versus merits of Reynolds. The flow here is okay, but the sudden shift to Goldsmith's epitaph and the critique of popular biography might be a bit disconnected from the previous paragraphs. 

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are some transitions that could be smoother. The fluency issues are mainly spelling and grammar errors, which are noticeable but don't completely disrupt understanding. So, for fluency, maybe a 3.5. Coherence is a bit lower because of the abrupt shifts and some unclear transitions, but it's not too bad. I'd say a 3.5 for coherence as well.
