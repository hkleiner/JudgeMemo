        • "traditionalistd" → "traditionalists"

    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward placement of "1807" in the sentence about crushed grain.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from anecdote to broader discussion of Meissonier’s artistic principles without clear linkage.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous reference to "1807" embedded mid-sentence disrupts narrative flow.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Jarring transition between the anecdote and the section on Delacroix/Ingres, which introduces external context abruptly.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Jump between Meissonier’s childhood and his father’s profession lacks smooth connection.
