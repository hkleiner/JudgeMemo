Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues. The text has several spelling mistakes. For example, "midsg" instead of "middle", "ws" instead of "we", "clme" instead of "come", "eaely" instead of "early", and "southrrn" instead of "southern". These are all [SPELLING] issues. There are also some grammatical errors, like "Our clothing each morning when ws arose to dress was as wet as if it had just clme from a wringer." The sentence structure here is awkward and the verb tense is off, which is a [GRAMMAR] issue. The word "Americwn" is misspelled as "Americwn", which is another [SPELLING] error. The phrase "qere" instead of "were" in "pedestrians qere pouring" is a [SPELLING] mistake. The word "pedeatrians" is misspelled as "pedeatrians" (should be "pedestrians"), which is a [SPELLING] error. The word "fod" is used instead of "for" in "fod, if we give credencebto the city's history", which is a [SPELLING] issue. The word "credencebto" is misspelled as "credencebto" (should be "credence to"), which is a [SPELLING] error. The phrase "the new city whkch has sprung up around it" has "whkch" instead of "which", another [SPELLING] error. The word "Tye" instead of "The" in "Tye strokes of eight o'clock" is a [SPELLING] issue. The word "eclisia" instead of "ecclesia" is a [SPELLING] error. The word "Calfutta" is misspelled as "Calfutta" (should be "Calcutta"), another [SPELLING] error. The word "wsek" instead of "week" in "about the end of the second wsek" is a [SPELLING] error.

Now, looking at Coherence issues. The text jumps from a description of the rainy season and the discomfort of the narrator to the history of Manila, which is a sudden shift in context. This is a [LOGIC] issue. The transition between the description of the bridge and the description of the people on the bridge is abrupt. There's no clear connection between the two parts, which is a [TRANSITION] issue. The text also mentions the notice posted about teachers needing to supply articles, but the notice itself is incomplete, ending with a colon and no content. This creates confusion and is a [LOGIC] issue. The text mixes different time frames without clear transitions, moving from the narrator's personal experience to the historical context of Manila and then back to the present, which can be confusing. This is a [LOGIC] issue. The paragraph about the people on the bridge is detailed and well-structured, but the transition to the description of the river and boats is abrupt. This is a [TRANSITION] issue. The text also references the "old wall" and its role in saving the city from Moros, but there's no prior mention of the wall, which makes the reference confusing. This is a [LOGIC] issue.

For the Fluency score, there are multiple spelling errors and some grammatical issues that affect the readability, but the overall structure and meaning are still clear. The errors are noticeable but not so frequent as to make the text difficult to understand. This would likely be a 3 or 3.5. However, considering the number of errors and their impact on fluency, I would say it's a 3.5.

For the Coherence score, the text has some logical jumps and abrupt transitions, but the overall narrative is still somewhat coherent. The main issues are the sudden shift from the narrator's experience to the history of Manila and the incomplete notice at the end. The text is generally understandable, but the transitions and logical flow could be improved. This would likely be a 3 or 3.5. Given the issues with transitions and logical flow, I would say it's a 3.5.
