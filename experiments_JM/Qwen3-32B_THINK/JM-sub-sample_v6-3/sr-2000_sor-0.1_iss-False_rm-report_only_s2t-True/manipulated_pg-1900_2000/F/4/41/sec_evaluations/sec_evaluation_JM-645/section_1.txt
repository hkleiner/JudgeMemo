Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The first thing I notice is that there are several spelling errors. For example, "pefceived" should be "perceived," "cleberness" should be "cleverness," "prgan" is probably "organ," and "reaeon" should be "reason." These misspellings can disrupt the flow and make the text harder to read.

Next, looking at grammar and syntax, there are some awkward constructions. For instance, the phrase "I could only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for kindness" is a run-on sentence with incorrect structure. It should be something like "I could only, however, declare that evening to him that he never missed one for kindness." The placement of "however" is off, and the sentence structure is confusing.

There are also some instances of incorrect word choice. For example, "I had my ideas, which were mainly to the effect that Corvick would marry her if her mother would only die" uses "would only die" which is a bit jarring and might be better phrased as "would only die." The phrasing here is a bit awkward and could be smoother.

Punctuation is another area to consider. The sentence "He had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiring—as on precipitate reflexion he judged—that he should catch thevnight-mail to Paris" has a missing space between "thevnight-mail" which should be "the night-mail." Also, the use of em dashes here is correct, but the overall sentence structure is a bit complex and could be clearer.

Looking at the second chapter, there are similar issues. "If he was in spirits it wasn’t because he had read my review" is missing a comma after "If he was in spirits," which makes the sentence flow awkwardly. Also, "the poverty of imagination involves in my small precautions" should be "the poverty of imagination involved in my small precautions." The verb tense is incorrect here.

Moving on to coherence, the text is a narrative that follows a logical progression, so the overall structure is sound. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from Corvick's situation to the visit to Bridges in Chapter II is somewhat abrupt without a clear transition. The reader might need a bit more context to smoothly follow the shift in focus.

Another issue is the clarity of some phrases. The sentence "He wasn’t of course popular, but I judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of that" is a bit confusing. The "that" at the end refers back to "popularity," but it's not entirely clear without prior context. This could make the reader pause and re-read to understand the connection.

There are also some instances where the narrative jumps between ideas without clear connections. For example, the transition from discussing Vereker's success to the lady brandishing the magazine in the end of Chapter II is a bit sudden. The reader might need more linking to understand how these events connect.

Overall, while the text has some fluency issues due to spelling, grammar, and awkward phrasing, the coherence is generally maintained with a logical progression of ideas. The main problems in fluency are the spelling errors and grammatical mistakes, while coherence suffers from some abrupt transitions and unclear connections between ideas.
