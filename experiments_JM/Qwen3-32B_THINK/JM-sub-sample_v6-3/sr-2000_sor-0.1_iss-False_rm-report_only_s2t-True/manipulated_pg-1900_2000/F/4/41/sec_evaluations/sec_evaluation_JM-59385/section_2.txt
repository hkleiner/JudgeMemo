Alright, I need to evaluate the current section for fluency and coherence based on the given criteria. Let me start with fluency.

First, I'll check for grammar and syntax issues. I notice "Kuei Ping had stood fitst in her class" – "fitst" is a typo, should be "first". That's a [SPELLING] error. Then "the small remembrance reward that had been given to her clasped in her hand." The structure here is a bit awkward. The phrase "clasped in her hand" is separated from the noun it modifies, which could be clearer. Maybe a [SYNTAX] issue.

Looking at the next paragraph: "In memory the fragrant perfume of the la France roses..." The phrase "In memory" is a bit vague. Maybe [CLARITY] here. Also, "she recalled the crunching sound Miss Porter’s stiff foreign shoes had made as she came down the path," – "stiff foreign shoes" might be a bit awkward phrasing. Possibly [LEXICON].

Moving on, "Kuei Ping thrilled to the memory of that touch more than to the glow of the pearls." The use of "thrilled to" is correct, but "thrilled to the memory" might be a bit non-standard phrasing. [LEXICON] again. 

In the part about Miss Porter: "qhere men and women had equal opportunity" – "qhere" is a typo for "where". [SPELLING]. Also, "gife service to her own country women" – "gife" should be "give". [SPELLING]. 

Then, "Kuei Ping had held her breath lest she lose a word while Miss Porter talked, quiet at first, carried away by the marvel of the opportunity, then very still because she knew its impossibility.mFor at the spring holidays..." The sentence structure here is a bit confusing. The transition from "quiet at first" to "then very still" is abrupt. Maybe [STRUCTURE] or [LOGIC]. Also, "mFor" is a typo for "For". [SPELLING].

In the family section: "There were ties that bound her a part of the whole..." The phrasing "bound her a part of the whole" is awkward. [SYNTAX]. Also, "bonds that could not be pushed aside with the brusqueness that made possible the spirit of freedom..." The phrase "with the brusqueness that made possible" is a bit convoluted. [SYNTAX].

In the last part: "The latter had been a trifke curt." "Trifke" is a typo for "trifle". [SPELLING]. Also, "The utter futility of attempting to make East and West understand each other had stilled hermlips from any sharing..." "hermlips" is a typo for "her lips". [SPELLING].

Now, for coherence. The text is a narrative, so I need to check the flow and logical progression. The section starts with Kuei Ping's memory, then shifts to her family plans, and ends with the conclusion of the pearl transaction. The transitions between these ideas are somewhat abrupt. For example, moving from the memory of Miss Porter to the family's plans feels a bit disconnected. [STRUCTURE]. Also, the mention of the engagement bracelets and the medal at the end might not clearly connect to the previous narrative about the pearls, causing some confusion. [LOGIC]. The final part about the chair-bearers seems to jump to a new scene without clear transition. [STRUCTURE].

Overall, there are several spelling and syntax issues in fluency, and some structural and logical jumps in coherence. The text is generally readable but has enough issues to lower the scores.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "fitst" (should be "first")  
- [SPELLING] "qhere" (should be "where")  
- [SPELLING] "gife" (should be "give")  
- [SPELLING] "trifke" (should be "trifle")  
- [SPELLING] "hermlips" (should be "her lips")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "the small remembrance reward...clasped in her hand" (clarity of noun-modifier relationship)  
- [SYNTAX] Confusing structure in "quiet at first, carried away...then very still" (abrupt transition)  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "bound her a part of the whole" (imprecise wording)  
- [LEXICON] "Thrilled to the memory" (uncommon phrasing that disrupts flow)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the memory of the school to the family’s marriage plans without clear transition  
- [LOGIC] Disconnection between the narrative about the pearls and the final mention of chair-bearers/tea ceremony  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt conclusion to Kuei Ping’s internal conflict without resolving the emotional tension  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the engagement bracelets/medal and the preceding narrative about the pearls  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
