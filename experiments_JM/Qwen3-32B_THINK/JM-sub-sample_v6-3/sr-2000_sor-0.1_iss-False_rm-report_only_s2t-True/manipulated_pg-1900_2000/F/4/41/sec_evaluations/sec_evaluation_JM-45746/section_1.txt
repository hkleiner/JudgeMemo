Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The user wants me to look for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text. There are a few typos, like "aspirationw" which should be "aspirations". Then "complilent" is misspelled; maybe it's supposed to be "compliment" but the context doesn't fit. "teachingcprofession" has a typo with a lowercase 'c' and a missing space. "associatws" is misspelled. "youngvmen" should be "young men". "througg" is a typo for "through". "hammerijg" is "hammering". "zt" should be "at". "hrre a yearnago" is "here a year ago". "whkch" is "which". "untio" is "until". "notkcwd" is "noted". "deskd" is "desks". "attebtion" is "attention". "kn" is "in". "Manyvyoung" is "Many young". "con" is "on". "ny" is "my". "wnen" is "when".

These spelling errors are quite a few. Now, checking for grammar. Some sentences have awkward phrasing. For example, "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession, to say nothing of the doubtful complilent of such an entry to the teachingcprofession." The structure here is a bit convoluted. Also, "Such a confession, however, could be made by many of my associatws of fifteen years ago." The phrase "of fifteen years ago" is a bit unclear; maybe "fifteen years ago" should be placed differently. 

Looking at syntax, some sentences are run-on or have misplaced modifiers. For instance, "The situation that confronted me after deciding to become a teacher temporarily, and two ways of meeting it, can be illustrated by the experiences of two youngvmen who entered the teaching profession under similar conditions." The structure here is a bit confusing. Also, "He enthusiastically told me that he was interested in the agricultural conditions in the surrounding districts, and was preparing boxes and equipment to offer a course in agriculture to the boys in and out of school who might wish to elect it." The list of people here could be clearer.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative about entering the teaching profession and getting a position. The flow seems logical as it moves from the author's personal experience to examples of two young men. However, there are some transitions that could be smoother. For example, the shift from the first example to the second young man is abrupt. Also, the connection between the two examples and the main thesis isn't always clear. There's a bit of repetition in the conclusion where the author contrasts the two men's approaches. The story is mostly coherent, but some parts are a bit disjointed, especially with the typos and awkward phrasing affecting the flow.

In terms of structure, the chapters are separate, but the transition between them is a bit jarring. The first chapter ends with the two examples, and the second chapter starts with the importance of considering one's fit in teaching. The link between the two chapters could be stronger. However, each chapter is internally coherent.

Overall, the text is generally readable but has enough fluency issues that affect the flow and some coherence issues with transitions and structure. The main problems are the typos and some awkward sentence structures. The coherence is mostly there but could be improved with better transitions.
