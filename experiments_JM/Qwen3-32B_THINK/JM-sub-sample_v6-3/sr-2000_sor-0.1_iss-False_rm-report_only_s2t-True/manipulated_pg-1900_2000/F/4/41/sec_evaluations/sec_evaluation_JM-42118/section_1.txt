Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. First, I'll look for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or issues with punctuation. 

Looking through the text, I notice a few spelling errors. For example, "mounfain's" should be "mountain's," "itchong" is likely "itching," "hisdvthinking" seems like "his thinking," "vorn" should be "born," "wanserings" is probably "wanderings," "pleasaunces" might be "pleasures," "pkeasure-seeking" is likely "pleasure-seeking," "Chateauroux" is misspelled as "Chateaurohx," "diffifult" should be "difficult," "intelligenfe" is "intelligence," "shd kept" might be "she kept," "lucrativd" should be "lucrative," and "throygh" is "through." These spelling errors can disrupt the flow and make the text less fluent.

Next, there are some grammatical issues. "As the glovemaker looked out of his sombre house over the sunlit slopes..." has a run-on sentence that could be broken into shorter sentences for better readability. "The worthy mercer was first in all the little town to know by his modest traffic in them; and that, too, only long after the things they shadowed were buried..." is a complex sentence that's hard to follow and could be simplified. "The small boy with the big head was vorn in the year after François Boucher came back to Paris from his Italian wanserings on the eve of his thirties and won to academic honour." has incorrect verb tenses and word order. "The child grew up in his Provençal home, whilst Boucher... was creating the Pastorals, Venus-pieces, and Cupid-pieces that changed the whole style of French art..." has a shift in tense that's confusing. "The nations, weary of war, agreed to sign the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. In this, our artist's sixteenth year, the Pompadour had been the king's acknowledged mistress for three years." has a disjointed transition between sentences. "He recovered, to enter Paris soon after as the Well-Beloved, and to be reconciled with the frail Chateaurohx before she died in the sudden agony in which she swore she had been poisoned." has a run-on sentence structure. "She dispensed rhe whole patronage of the sovereign with her pretty hands." has a missing word, possibly "the" before "whole." "As though these things were not load enough to bow the shoulders of any one human being shd kept a rein upon every national activity." has a missing word and incorrect phrasing. "She created the porcelain factory of Sèvres, thereby adding a lucrativd industry to France." has a missing word and incorrect spelling.

Now, moving to coherence. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, transitions are smooth, and there's a clear progression. 

The text starts with the birth of Fragonard and the setting of Grasse, which is good. However, the transition from the description of Grasse to the political gossip about Louis XV is abrupt. The reader might find it confusing how the political events in Paris are connected to Fragonard's life. The narrative shifts from the local setting to national politics without clear transitions, making it hard to follow the connection. The mention of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle and the Pompadour's influence is detailed, but the link to Fragonard's development as an artist is not clearly established. The text then jumps to the chapter on Rome, which seems to introduce a new section without a clear connection to the previous content. There's a lack of clear transitions between different time periods and events, such as moving from the Pompadour's influence to the news of Fragonard being apprenticed to a notary. The narrative could benefit from more explicit connections to help the reader follow the timeline and the influences on Fragonard's life and career.

In terms of structure, the text is divided into chapters, but the flow between them is not always smooth. The chapter "Rome" starts abruptly after discussing the Pompadour's influence, without a clear transition from the previous chapter. The information about the political events and the Pompadour's role is detailed but not clearly tied back to Fragonard's personal journey, which might leave the reader wondering how these events influenced his career. The text also includes a lot of historical and political information that, while relevant to the cultural context, could be better integrated with the narrative about Fragonard's life to maintain coherence.

Overall, while the text provides a rich historical and cultural background, the transitions between different topics and the connection between the political events and Fragonard's personal story need improvement for better coherence. The fluency is affected by several spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow, while the coherence is impacted by abrupt shifts and unclear transitions between different parts of the narrative.
