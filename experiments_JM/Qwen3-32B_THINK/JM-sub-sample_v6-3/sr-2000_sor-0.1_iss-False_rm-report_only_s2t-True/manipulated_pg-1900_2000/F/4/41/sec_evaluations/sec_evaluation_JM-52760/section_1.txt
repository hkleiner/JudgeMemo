Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. First, I need to check for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice issues. 

Looking through the first paragraph, I see "Richmlnd" instead of "Richmond" â€“ that's a spelling error. Then there's "ij destroying" which should be "in destroying". Later, "ot growing concern" is probably "of growing concern". There's also a typo in "armied" which should be "armies". In the section about Union strategy, "yhe conquest" is misspelled as "yhe". The word "Rivets" is used instead of "Rivers". In the Strategic Petersburg chapter, "Rivervabout" is a typo for "River about". "Im dhort, Petersburg wasva" should be "In short, Petersburg was a". 

For coherence, the text starts with a prologue about the Civil War context, then moves into Union strategy, and then into strategic details about Petersburg. The transition between chapters seems logical. However, there's a sudden list of battles and movements without much explanation, which might confuse some readers. Also, the mention of "Grant's campaign" in the Union Strategy chapter refers back to the Prologue without clear linkage, which could be a minor coherence issue. The flow from the prologue to the strategy and then to the strategic importance of Petersburg is generally smooth, but the abrupt list of battles might disrupt the flow slightly.

Considering all these points, the fluency has several spelling and minor grammatical errors that might distract a reader, but the overall text is still understandable. Coherence is mostly maintained, but the list of battles and the lack of some transitions could be points of confusion.
