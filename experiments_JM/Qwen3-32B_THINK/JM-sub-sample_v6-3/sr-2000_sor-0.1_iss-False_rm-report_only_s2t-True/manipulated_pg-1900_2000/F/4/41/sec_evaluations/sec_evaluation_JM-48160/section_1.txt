Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues in the text. First, I notice several spelling errors. For example, "us sharply divided" should be "is sharply divided." There's also "mf contact" which is probably a typo for "of contact." Then there's "tk ingratiate" which should be "to ingratiate." These are all spelling mistakes. 

Next, grammar and syntax problems. The sentence "France to-day us sharply divided into two sections;" has incorrect subject-verb agreement and a semicolon where a period might be better. "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit..." uses "is" after "necessary," which is correct, but the overall sentence structure feels a bit awkward. There's also "I have felt like an inverted snob trying tk ingratiate myself..." which has a typo in "tk" and the sentence structure is a bit run-on.

Punctuation issues include missing spaces after periods and commas. For example, "August 8, 1916." should have a space after the period. Also, "But the other, the Zone des Armées, in common parlance the war or military zone!" has a comma splice. 

Word choice and phrasing: "detestimg foreigners" is misspelled; it should be "detesting." "intensive, detestimg foreigners..." might be a typo for "intensive, detesting." Also, "I made no attempt to enter this proscribed region for six or seven weeks xfter my arrival..." has a typo in "xfter" which should be "after."

Now, moving to Coherence. The text is a narrative, so the flow and logical progression are important. The author starts by discussing the division in France, then shifts to personal experiences trying to enter the war zone. There are transitions like "However—to return to the war zone." which help, but some parts might be abrupt. 

For example, after talking about the Duchess d’Uzès, the narrative jumps to the Service de Santé and the process of obtaining permits. The connection between these sections is somewhat loose. Also, the mention of different cities like Rouen, Meaux, etc., and the author's refusal to go to certain places might not be clearly connected in terms of the overall narrative flow. 

There's a part where the author is told they can only go to Rouen and Meaux, which they find unsatisfactory. Then they make a list of other cities. The transition from the initial refusal to the list of alternatives is a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of Verdun and the friend's concern about the Grand Quartier Générale isn't clearly explained in the context of the author's goals. 

Some sections might be repetitive, like the emphasis on the difficulty of obtaining permits and the bureaucratic process. The narrative could be more tightly structured to show the progression from initial attempts to the final success in getting the carnet rouge. 

Overall, the text is coherent in that it tells a story of the author's efforts, but there are some abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that could affect the flow.
