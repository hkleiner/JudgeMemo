Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current segment. I'll look for issues related to grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Fluency Issues:
- [SPELLING] "disheartenex" is misspelled; should be "disheartened".
- [SPELLING] "takecthis" is misspelled; should be "take this".
- [SPELLING] "fromcthe" is misspelled; should be "from the".
- [SPELLING] "dhoulders" is misspelled; should be "shoulders".
- [SPELLING] "daykight" is misspelled; should be "daylight".
- [SPELLING] "animile" is misspelled; should be "animal".
- [SPELLING] "oved" is misspelled; should be "over".
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas after introductory phrases like "Say, you ain't got no call..." and "Boy, you'll be sailing..."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas after introductory dialogue tags like "replied Jim" and "returned Bud".
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing periods at the end of some sentences.
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing quotation marks for some dialogue.
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences have awkward phrasing, like "You bet cher life, you've got an animile there that'll go when he gets ready, and as fast as he pretty well damn pleases--nail him!"
- [SYNTAX] Some sentences are overly long and could be broken up for clarity.
- [LEXICON] Some word choices are unusual or archaic, like "cher" instead of "your" or "you're".

Now for coherence, I'll look at how the ideas flow together, logical sequencing, transitions, and overall structure.

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The story jumps between different events without clear transitions (e.g., from Bud giving Jim money to the story about being held up).
- [LOGIC] The sudden shift to Bud recounting a story about being held up is somewhat abrupt and not clearly connected to the previous conversation.
- [CLARITY] Some references are unclear without additional context (e.g., "the herd of burros" without clear explanation).
- [CLARITY] The story about being held up is somewhat confusing in its sequence and details.
- [TRANSITION] The transition from Bud's offer to take the horse to the story about being held up is abrupt and not well connected.

Based on these issues, I would rate the fluency as a 2.5. The text has numerous spelling errors and punctuation issues that make reading difficult. The awkward phrasing and unusual word choices also contribute to a less fluent reading experience.

For coherence, I would rate it as a 3.5. The overall story is somewhat coherent and the dialogue makes sense, but there are some abrupt shifts in the narrative and unclear transitions between different parts of the story. The story about being held up feels somewhat disconnected from the main conversation about Jim taking the horse.

Let me double check my assessment to ensure it's accurate:

Fluency: The text has numerous spelling errors (disheartenex, takecthis, fromcthe, dhoulders, daykight, animile, oved), missing punctuation (commas after introductory phrases, missing periods at the end of sentences), and some awkward phrasing. These issues make the text harder to read and understand. It's not completely incoherent, but the errors are frequent enough to significantly impact readability.

Coherence: The overall narrative is somewhat coherent as we can follow the conversation between Bud and Jim. However, there are some abrupt shifts in the story, particularly with the sudden shift to Bud recounting a story about being held up. Some references are unclear without additional context. The story has a logical flow for the most part, but the transitions between different parts could be smoother.

So I'll finalize my scores as:
Fluency: 2.5
Coherence: 3.5
