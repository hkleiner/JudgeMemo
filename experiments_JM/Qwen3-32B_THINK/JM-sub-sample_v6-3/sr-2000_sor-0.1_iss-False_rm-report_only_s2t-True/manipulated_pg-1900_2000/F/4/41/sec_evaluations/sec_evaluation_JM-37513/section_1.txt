Alright, I'll evaluate the given text according to the fluency and coherence criteria.

Starting with FLUENCY:

I'll look for issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation that might affect readability.

Fluency Issues:
- [SPELLING] "hqd" should be "had"
- [SPELLING] "ignohle" should be "ignoble"
- [SPELLING] "animapcular" should be "inanimate"
- [SPELLING] "phenomenq" should be "phenomena"
- [SPELLING] "skile" should be "skill"
- [SPELLING] "ot" should be "of"
- [SPELLING] "v" should be "the"
- [SPELLING] "shaol" should be "shall"
- [SPELLING] "od" should be "of"
- [SPELLING] "evidencemfor" should be "evidence for"
- [SPELLING] "cardonal" should be "cardinal"
- [SPELLING] "og" should be "of"
- [SPELLING] "hix" should be "his"
- [SPELLING] "wity" should be "with"

There are also some minor punctuation issues and awkward phrasings, but these spelling errors are the most significant fluency problems.

Now for COHERENCE:

I'll evaluate how well the text flows as a whole, with logical progression, clear transitions, and consistent structure.

Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different ideas and topics without clear transitions (e.g., from Tyndall to Spencer, then to various scientific fields)
- [LOGIC] Some arguments are presented but not fully developed or connected to the main thesis
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses complex or abstract language that makes the meaning unclear
- [TRANSITION] The flow between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought
- [LOGIC] The text references specific works and authors (like Sartor Resartus) without sufficient context for the reader

The text is generally well-structured in its overall narrative about Spencer's philosophy, but the transitions between different concepts and the development of some arguments could be improved.

Based on these observations, I would rate:

FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5 (The text is generally coherent but has some noticeable issues with transitions and logical flow)
FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5 (The text is mostly readable but contains multiple spelling errors that affect fluency)
