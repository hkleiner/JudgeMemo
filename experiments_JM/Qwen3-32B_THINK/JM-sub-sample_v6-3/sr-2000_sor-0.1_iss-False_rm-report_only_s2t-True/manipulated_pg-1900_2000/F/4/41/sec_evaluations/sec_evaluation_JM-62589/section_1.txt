Alright, let me go through this text and evaluate the fluency and coherence. Starting with fluency. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "HOWvDEBBY" should probably be "HOW DEBBY" with a space. There's also "to bebtolerated" which is missing a space and maybe a hyphen, but it's unclear. "It wasvquite" has a typo with "v" instead of "v" maybe, but it's actually a lowercase 'v' where it should be a space. Then "the door of thw wretched home" – "thw" is a typo for "the". "It mattered little to Debby wnether her father was Whig or Tory" – "wnether" should be "whether". "treasjre of lonely yezrs" – "treasjre" is "treasure" and "yezrs" is "years". "whixh dragged drearily away after Mr. Mason left the town, Devby" – "Devby" should be "Debby". 

Looking at grammar, there are some missing commas. For instance, "One July morning, over a hundred years ago there stood..." should have a comma after "ago". Also, "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes." That's correct, but maybe the sentence structure could be smoother. 

Syntax issues: Some sentences are a bit awkward. For example, "He is to bebtolerated in the town, he must go..." The structure here is a bit confusing. Also, "ahe had not even that hope..." – "ahe" is likely a typo for "she". 

Word choice: "He would not leave me, but even if he did he would come back, he always does!" The repetition of "he" might be confusing. Also, "He’s going to be a man" – the phrasing is okay, but could be more natural. 

Punctuation: Missing commas in places like "But I tell thee, child, he hath joined this wild crew..." is correct. However, in "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes." The structure is okay, but maybe a semicolon could help. 

Now for coherence. The story needs to have a logical flow. The beginning introduces Debby and her father, then the conflict with Mrs. Lane. The transition from Debby's home to Mrs. Lane's house is abrupt. The part where Debby is taken away and the subsequent events in her new home are a bit disjointed. 

There are some unclear transitions. For example, after Mason leaves, the focus shifts to Debby's life with Mrs. Lane. The connection between her past and present isn't very smooth. Also, the mention of her mother's story is introduced but not clearly connected to the present events. 

Ambiguities: The reference to "the town hath done well to try and save thy soul and body" is a bit unclear in context. Also, the last paragraph where Debby remembers her mother is a bit abrupt and doesn't clearly tie into the current narrative. 

Structure: The story is in a historical setting, which is consistent, but the pacing is uneven. Some parts are detailed, while others are rushed. The progression from Debby's childhood to her being with Mrs. Lane is a bit jumpy. 

Overall, the text has a few fluency issues that are mostly spelling and minor grammar errors, which would lower the fluency score a bit. For coherence, there are some abrupt transitions and unclear connections, but the overall narrative is still understandable. So I'd rate fluency around 3.5 and coherence around 3.5 as well.
