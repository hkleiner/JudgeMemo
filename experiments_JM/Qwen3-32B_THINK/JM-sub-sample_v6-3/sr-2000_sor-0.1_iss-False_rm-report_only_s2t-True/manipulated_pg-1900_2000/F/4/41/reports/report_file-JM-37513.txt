  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • The text jumps between different ideas and topics without clear transitions (e.g., from Tyndall to Spencer, then to various scientific fields)
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Some arguments are presented but not fully developed or connected to the main thesis
        • The text references specific works and authors (like Sartor Resartus) without sufficient context for the reader
    - [CLARITY]:
        • The text occasionally uses complex or abstract language that makes the meaning unclear
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • The flow between paragraphs is sometimes abrupt, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought

        • Overly complex and fragmented sentences (e.g., run-on sentences with multiple clauses)
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Ambiguous phrasing in "the sixteen articles of the Spencerian creed" (unclear reference without context)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shifts between abstract philosophical concepts and biographical references (e.g., from "sixteen articles of the Spencerian creed" to "the affairs of the mind")
        • Confusing juxtaposition of Spencer’s deterministic philosophy and the unresolved "mystery" of the unknowable
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Underdeveloped transitions between paragraphs (e.g., abrupt jump from "the universality of law" to "First Principles")
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Repetition of "Matter, Motion, and Force" without resolving their interrelation
