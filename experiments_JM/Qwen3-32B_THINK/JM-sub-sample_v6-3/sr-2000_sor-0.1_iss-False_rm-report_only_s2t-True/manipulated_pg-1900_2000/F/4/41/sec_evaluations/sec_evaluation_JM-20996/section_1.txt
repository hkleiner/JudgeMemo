Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. 

First, I'll look for spelling mistakes. I notice "yhe" instead of "the" in the first paragraph. There's also "qnd" instead of "and". Other spelling errors like "lemons" with a typo in the context of the ship's departure. Then, "pedagogical equipment" seems correct, but maybe "plaj" instead of "plain"? "Moungain" should be "mountain", "ovwr" as "over", "bplucked" as "plucked", "bin" as "in", "vessels" in "vessels in the history of the world" might be correct, but "vessels" is plural, which is okay. 

Next, grammar and syntax. The sentence structure in some parts is a bit awkward. For example, "It was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement without precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents concurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have furnished the material for this book." This is a run-on sentence with multiple clauses. Also, "have furnished the material for this book" – the tense might be inconsistent. 

Punctuation issues: Missing commas in complex sentences. For example, "It has been the object of the writer to weave into the story of his actual experiencesvan account of those things which are qs yet an unexplored field in the realm of letters." Here, "experiencesvan" is a typo for "experiences an account", and "qs" is "as". Also, "qnd" in "Between Honolulu qnd Manila" should be "and". 

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases are awkward. "The ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just fallen, announcing the hour of nkon in the one hundred and twentieth meridian" – "nkon" is likely a typo for "noon". "The United States Army Transport 'Thomas' swung out into the middle of the bay, where it dropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons and a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's department." This is a bit wordy. 

Looking at coherence: The text is a historical narrative about the establishment of schools in the Philippines. The flow seems logical, moving from the preface to the events on July 23, 1901, the journey to the Hawaiian Islands, the description of Honolulu, and then to Manila. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from the journey to Honolulu to the description of the Pali and the Bishop Museum is smooth, but the mention of the "Century Magazine for September, 1889" seems out of place and disrupts the narrative. Also, the anecdote about Napoleon and the sailors crossing the equator is a digression that might confuse the reader. 

Other coherence issues: The text references a "Century Magazine" article from 1889, which is anachronistic since the main narrative is about events in 1901. This inconsistency could confuse readers. Additionally, the transition from the date line crossing to Manila might be abrupt without clear connection. 

Now, summarizing the fluency issues: multiple spelling errors, awkward sentence structures, missing commas, and some word choice issues. Coherence issues include the anachronistic reference to the magazine and the digression about Napoleon, which might not fit the main narrative. 

For fluency score: There are several errors that affect readability but the text is still understandable. Maybe a 3.5? Coherence has some issues with the anachronism and digressions, but overall the narrative is logical. Coherence score might be 3.5 as well.
