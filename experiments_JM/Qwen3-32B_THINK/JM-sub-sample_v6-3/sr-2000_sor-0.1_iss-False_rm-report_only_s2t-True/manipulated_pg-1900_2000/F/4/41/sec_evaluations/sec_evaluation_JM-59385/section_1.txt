Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the Fluency and Coherence of the given text. The user provided a story excerpt, so I'll start by scanning for any fluency issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice problems.

Looking at the first paragraph, everything seems fine. But moving on, I notice some typos. For example, "ky limited knowledge" should probably be "my". Also, "brilluancy" is misspelled; it should be "brilliancy" or "brilliance". There's "with ky limited knowledge" againâ€”another typo. 

Next, "it will bembought her dowry jewels" has a typo where "bembought" should be "be bought". Then there's "shakl convert" which is likely "shall convert". The word "anility" might be a typo for "inability", and "hoysehold" should be "household". 

In the part about Yen Kuei Ping, "forwxrd" is misspelled as "forward". "Ascshe" seems to be "as she". "Intergals" should be "intervals", and "hevhad" is "he had". "Zt" in "seasoned zt the game" is probably "at". "Madams Yen" is missing an apostrophe and should be "Madame Yen's". 

Now for coherence. The story starts well, but there are some issues. The transition from the description of the Street of Precious Pearls to the specific scene with Yen Kuei Ping is smooth, but later, when the narrative jumps to Kuei Ping's memory of the mission school at the end, it's a bit abrupt. There's no clear transition explaining why she's suddenly thinking about the mission school, which might confuse readers. 

The structure is mostly logical, but the shift to the mission school scene feels disconnected from the previous jeweler scene. The coherence could be improved by a smoother transition or a hint earlier on that this memory is relevant. Also, the mention of the mission school at the end seems to introduce a new idea without much context, which might make the overall narrative feel a bit disjointed. 

Putting this all together, the fluency has several spelling and grammar errors, which would lower the score. Coherence is mostly good but has a noticeable abrupt shift at the end. So, I'd rate Fluency around 3.5 and Coherence around 4.
