Let me analyze the evaluation report and determine the final fluency and coherence scores for the text.

For FLUENCY:
Section 01 has a fluency score of 2.5 with numerous spelling errors and some grammar issues.
Section 02 has a fluency score of 3.5 with more spelling errors but fewer issues overall.

Looking at the issues:
- Section 01 has 11 spelling errors and 4 grammar issues
- Section 02 has 10 spelling errors and fewer grammar issues mentioned

The fluency issues are quite frequent and include spelling errors like "ith" instead of "is", "wcaly" instead of "walley", and others. There are also grammar issues like missing commas and typos. These issues would significantly impact readability.

Since section 01 is at 2.5 and section 02 is at 3.5, I need to find an average that reflects the overall fluency. Given that the issues are consistent across both sections but improve slightly in section 02, I would rate fluency at 3.0.

For COHERENCE:
Section 01 has a coherence score of 4.0 with some issues.
Section 02 has a coherence score of 4.0 with similar issues.

Looking at the issues:
- Section 01 has 3 coherence issues (clarity, logic, transition)
- Section 02 has 3 coherence issues (transition, clarity, structure)

The coherence issues include sudden perspective shifts, inconsistent references, and abrupt transitions. These issues are noticeable but don't completely disrupt the overall narrative flow.

Since both sections are at 4.0, and the issues are somewhat consistent across both, I would maintain a coherence score of 4.0 for the overall text.

Now I'll format my answer as requested.

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
