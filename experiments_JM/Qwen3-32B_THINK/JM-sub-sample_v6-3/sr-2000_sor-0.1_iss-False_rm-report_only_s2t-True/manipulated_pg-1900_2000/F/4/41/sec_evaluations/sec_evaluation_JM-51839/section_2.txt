Alright, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The task is to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section, which is a chapter about Nacogdoches and Philip Nolan. I need to identify issues in both categories and assign scores based on the given criteria.

First, for fluency, I'll look for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing, or any issues with sentence structure. The text is quite old, so some archaic language is expected, but I need to focus on errors that affect readability. Let me go through the text line by line.

Starting with the first paragraph: "The city of Nacogdoches, as a covic corporation, dates from that year..." The word "covic" is likely a typo for "civic." That's a spelling error. Then, "bewildered followers from their experimental settlement of Bucareli on the Trinity river, to the old Mission of Guadalupe." The capitalization of "Trinity river" might be incorrect; usually, rivers are capitalized, but "Trinity River" would be the correct form. Also, "uncettain" is a misspelling of "uncertain." 

Next sentence: "Louisiana belonged to Spain, and the government was but little concerned to mark out definitely the exact limitation between its provinces." The phrase "mark out definitely the exact limitation" is a bit awkward. It could be rephrased for clarity, but it's still understandable. 

Moving on to the section about Gil Ybarbo: "that industrious old Spaniard erected on his own account what he and his followers called 'The Stone House,' now generally referred to as 'The Old Stone Fort.'" The use of "on his own account" is correct here. However, the sentence structure is a bit long, but not necessarily a fluency issue. 

In the next paragraph: "But the construction of its walls—almost a yard in thickness—made it practically impregnable to the ordinary means of offense; so that it naturally became a place of refuge and haven of safety in the successive perils that visited the old border-tkwn." The word "border-tkwn" is a typo for "border-town." Also, "offense" might be better as "offense" (American spelling) but the context is correct. 

Then, "Gil Ybarbo, ruling his people as a benevolent despot, was officially known as Lieutenant Governor of the Eastern Province of the New Philoppines and Military Comandante of the Post of Our Mother of the Pilar of Nacogdoches." "Philoppines" is a typo for "Philippines," and "Comandante" should be "Commandante." 

Next: "He promulgated the first Book of Ordinances for the government of the city in 1780, the original of which is now in the Nacogdoches Archives in the Capitol at Austin." The sentence is clear and grammatically correct. 

In the paragraph about the city's growth: "The new city grew apace, and by the beginning of the Nineteenth Century embraced a population of several hundred souls." The phrase "grew apace" is archaic but acceptable. "Nineteenth Century" should be capitalized as "Nineteenth Century." 

Continuing: "Don Carlos de Zepeda succeeded Ybarbo as Lieutenant Governor, and in turn wascfollowed by a succession of officials who had charge of the public business of the town..." "wascfollowed" is a typo for "was followed." 

In the Philip Nolan section: "The population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his Garrison..." "Population... were" is a subject-verb agreement error; "population" is singular, so it should be "was." 

Next: "Lieutenant Bernardo D’Ortolan, a Frenchman by birth, was left in charge of the garrison here while Musquiz was on his expedition; during this time he conveyed titles to land to such settlers as applied for them." The sentence is long but grammatically correct. 

"Correspondence found in the possession of Nolan enabled Musquiz to discover various ramifications of the plot of Nolan, Burr and Wilkinson among the inhabitants in Nacogdoches." The repetition of "Nolan" is a bit awkward but not a major issue. 

"One of the local leaders was a Spanish woman, Gertrudis Leal, and her husband, Antonio Leal, who were tried for treason by Musquuz." The name "Musquuz" is likely a typo for "Musquiz." 

"Padre Bernadino Vallejo, was also one of the conspirators, but the robes of St. Francis saved him from punishment for his part jn the plot." "jn" is a typo for "in." 

"Samuel Davenport was also found to be in some manner connected with the affair, but he was shrewd enough to escape being tried, as was also a man by the name of Cook, who then lived at Nacogdoches." The phrase "in some manner" is a bit wordy but not incorrect. 

"In the beginning of the new century the purchase of Louisiana by the United States from the Frsnch, in consequence of the Napoleonic upheaval in Europe, brought about a great change in the political and military affairs of Nacogdoches." "Frsnch" is a typo for "French." 

Looking at the coherence issues: The text is a historical account, so it should have a logical flow. The transition between the establishment of Nacogdoches and the Philip Nolan incident seems abrupt. However, since it's a chapter on Philip Nolan, the shift makes sense. The narrative is generally chronological, but some sentences are long and could be split for better readability. For example, the sentence about Ybarbo's title is very long and might confuse the reader. Also, the mention of "border-tkwn" and other typos might cause confusion. The coherence is maintained through the use of dates and clear references to events, but the typos and some awkward phrasing could disrupt the flow. 

In terms of coherence, the text is mostly logical, but the typos and some abrupt transitions (like moving from the city's growth to the Philip Nolan incident) might be considered minor issues. However, since the text is a chapter on Philip Nolan, the shift is appropriate. The main coherence issue is the lack of clear transitions between some paragraphs, but overall, the structure is coherent.
