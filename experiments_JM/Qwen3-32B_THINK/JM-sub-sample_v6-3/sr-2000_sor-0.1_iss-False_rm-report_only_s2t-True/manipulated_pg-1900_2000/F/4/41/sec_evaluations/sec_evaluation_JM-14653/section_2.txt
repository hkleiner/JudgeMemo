Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The first thing I notice is some spelling errors. For example, "whatvthey" should be "what they," and "nowcfeel" is missing a space. There are also instances like "chold" and "chipd," which are likely typos for "child." These spelling mistakes can disrupt the flow as the reader has to pause to figure out the correct words. 

Next, checking the grammar and syntax, there are a few awkward phrasings. For instance, "They were written byndevotees" probably should be "by devotees," with a space. The phrase "this age could not have produced them" is correct, but the sentence structure feels a bit abrupt. Also, "It is due to the labours of a set of idealists" is grammatically correct, but the word choice "labours" might be a bit old-fashioned, which might not be an error but could affect fluency depending on the intended style.

Looking at punctuation, there are some missing or misplaced commas. For example, in "No! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable," the exclamation mark is correctly used, but the following sentence could benefit from a comma after "undeniable" for clarity. Additionally, the sentence "They would leave naught alone; and they scorned consequences." uses a semicolon appropriately, but the structure might be a bit complex for some readers.

Moving on to coherence. The text discusses the diminishing Christmas spirit and attributes it to the rise of scientific and philosophical skepticism. The argument is generally logical, but there are a few places where the transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, the shift from talking about the old Christmas hymns to the impact of idealists might be abrupt. The mention of Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, and Huxley is relevant, but the connection between their work and the Christmas spirit isn't immediately clear, which could confuse readers.

There are also some instances where the text references previous points without sufficient context. For example, "the movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the realm or thought" refers to the movement of doubt and skepticism, but the transition from the idealists' labours to the movement spreading might be a bit jarring. Additionally, the conclusion about the Christmas spirit not being knocked out is a strong statement, but the supporting arguments leading up to it could be more tightly connected to ensure the reader follows the logic.

Overall, the text maintains a coherent argument about the loss of faith and its impact on Christmas traditions. However, the transitions between some paragraphs and the clarity of certain connections could be improved. The use of complex sentences and some archaic language might also contribute to a slightly disjointed feel for modern readers.
