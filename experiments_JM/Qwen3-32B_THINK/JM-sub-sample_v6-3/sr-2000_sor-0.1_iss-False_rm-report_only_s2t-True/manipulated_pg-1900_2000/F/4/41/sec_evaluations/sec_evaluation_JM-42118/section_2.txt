Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. I'll go through the current section and check for any errors or awkward phrasing.

First, I notice some spelling errors. For example, "Yreaty" should be "Treaty," "gteatest" should be "greatest," "manesty" should be "majesty," "pouref" should be "poured," "Pawtorals" should be "Pastorals," "sufficiently to sign his name upon it--the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' ti guide him" has a typo "ti" instead of "to," "enlarhement" should be "enlargement," and "slightlymunder" should be "slightly under." These are all spelling issues.

Next, there are some grammatical issues. In the sentence "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honoré, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days," the structure is a bit awkward and could be clearer. Also, "he was also required to paint an 'wnlarvement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils," the term "wnlarvement" is misspelled and should be "enlargement," and the sentence structure is a bit confusing. Another example is "The artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils, the State demanding, however, that the artist should work overnit sufficiently to sign his name upon it--the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' ti guide him; the weavers working from the enlargement." The sentence is long and has multiple clauses, making it hard to follow. The phrase "overnit" seems to be a typo for "overnight."

There's also some awkward phrasing and word choice. For instance, "he lacked sufficientcdexterity in the use of his tools" has a typo "sufficientcdexterity" which should be "sufficient dexterity." The sentence "he was to be beholden to him" is correct but a bit formal and could be phrased more naturally. "It was in this year that Boucher was given a studio and apartments at the Louvre." The structure here is a bit awkward and could be clearer. 

Looking at punctuation, there are some issues with commas and semicolons. For example, in the sentence "he was at that time living in the Rue Grenelle-Saint-Honoré, which he was about to leave, and in which Fragonard in his old age was destined to end his days," the commas are used correctly, but the sentence is long and could be split for clarity. The use of semicolons in complex sentences like "The artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils, the State demanding, however, that the artist should work overnit sufficiently to sign his name upon it--the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' ti guide him; the weavers working from the enlargement." This is a very long sentence with multiple semicolons and dashes, which makes it difficult to follow. 

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a narrative about Fragonard's early life and his journey in becoming an artist. The story is generally coherent, with a clear progression from one event to the next. However, there are a few areas where the flow is a bit abrupt or where transitions could be smoother.

The transition from the part about Boucher to the appointment of Abel Poisson de Vandières is a bit sudden. The text jumps from Fragonard's training under Boucher to the political appointment of Pompadour's brother. This could be confusing for the reader because the connection between these two events isn't clearly established. The text mentions that the Pompadour caused her brother to be appointed, but it doesn't explain how this relates to Fragonard's career, making the transition feel abrupt.

Another point is the mention of the quarrels between priests and parliaments and the Damiens stabbing the king. This historical event is introduced without much context or explanation of its relevance to Fragonard's story. The text seems to jump from Fragonard's artistic development to this political event, which might not be directly related, causing a minor disruption in the narrative flow.

There are also some instances where the text could be clearer in its connections. For example, the sentence "The Director-General of Buildings to the king (or, as we should nowadays call him, Minister of Fine Arts), Lenormant de Tournehem, kinsman to the Pompadour, died suddenly in the November of 1751; the Pompadour promptly caused to be appointed in his place her brother Abel Poisson de Vandières--a shy, handsome youth, a gentleman, a man of honour, who brought to his office an exquisite taste, a loyal nature, and marked abilities." The transition from the death of Lenormant to the appointment of Abel is clear, but the connection to Fragonard isn't immediately obvious, which might make the reader wonder why this information is included.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are a few instances where the flow could be smoother and where transitions between different events or topics could be better explained. The narrative structure is generally logical, but the sudden shifts in focus and the inclusion of unrelated historical events without context can make the text feel a bit disjointed in places.
