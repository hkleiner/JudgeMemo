Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [SPELLING] "whonare" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "whose are"
2. [SPELLING] "evefy" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "every"
3. [SPELLING] "penduoum" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "pendulum"
4. [SPELLING] "Inxustrial" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "Industrial"
5. [SPELLING] "folliwed" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "followed"
6. [SPELLING] "profunrly" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "profoundly"
7. [SPELLING] "saeculum" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "saeculum" (though this is a Latin term, it's written incorrectly)
8. [SPELLING] "plains theough" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "plains through"
9. [SPELLING] "whdther" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "whether"
10. [SPELLING] "arbitraru" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "arbitrary"
11. [SPELLING] "negan" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "began"
12. [SPELLING] "waggon" - This appears to be a British spelling variation, but it's inconsistent with the modern British spelling "wagon"
13. [SPELLING] "used" - This appears to be a spelling error, the text has "yse" instead
14. [SPELLING] "changee" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "changes"
15. [SPELLING] "yhe" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "the"
16. [SPELLING] "probleks" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "problems"
17. [SPELLING] "spenf" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "spend"
18. [SPELLING] "massea" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "masses"
19. [SPELLING] "largsr" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "larger"
20. [SPELLING] "yhe" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "the"
21. [SPELLING] "scolars" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "scholars"
22. [SPELLING] "Tbey" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "They"
23. [SPELLING] "nevdr" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely should be "never"

These spelling errors would significantly impact the fluency of the text.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text is quite long and dense, covering many different topics in a continuous flow without clear sectioning.
2. [LOGIC] The text jumps between discussing historical theories and specific examples without always making clear connections.
3. [LOGIC] The transition from discussing the Industrial Revolution to the French Revolution to the Victorian Age is abrupt.
4. [LOGIC] The discussion of the English nation in the 18th century seems disconnected from the previous discussion of the Industrial Revolution.
5. [LOGIC] The text moves from discussing the aristocracy to political corruption to the French Revolution without clear transitions.
6. [LOGIC] The final paragraph about the 18th century and Chauvinism seems disconnected from the rest of the text.

Now, I'll score the text for fluency and coherence:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous spelling errors that would significantly impact readability. The errors are frequent and would distract from reading and understanding. Given the scale, I would rate this as a 2 - the text contains frequent grammatical errors and spelling mistakes that make comprehension difficult without effort.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has some logical structure but suffers from abrupt transitions and disconnected ideas. The flow of ideas is not always smooth or clear, and the connections between different historical topics could be better established. I would rate this as a 3 - the text is generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.
