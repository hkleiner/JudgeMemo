Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency.

First, I'll look for grammatical errors. The text is quite long, but I'll scan through. I notice some sentences are a bit complex, like "He is proudly conscious at the time that he is a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement..." The structure here is a bit convoluted but still understandable. There's a semicolon used correctly in "But some of us venture to think that in that admirable historical romance..." which is good. 

Next, punctuation. The use of em dashes and commas seems appropriate. For example, "He is proudly conscious at the time that he is a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement, and he would be more than human if he had not in him a touch of the literary Pharisee." The comma after "excitement" is correct here. There's also a correctly used em dash in "But . . . de gustibus . . . !" which is a stylistic choice and not an error.

Spelling: I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "Pharisee" and "immortality" are spelled correctly. The titles of books are italicized correctly. 

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases are a bit archaic or old-fashioned, like "He is proudly conscious at the time..." which is a bit stiff, but that's more of a style choice than a fluency issue. The sentence "Twenty thousand people will greedily read _Twice Murdered and Once Hung_ and no doubt they have their reward..." uses "greedily" which is a strong word but appropriate in context. 

Looking at the longer sentences, they do get a bit lengthy, but they are structured with proper commas and conjunctions. For example, "And the children of the twenty thousand will not know _Twice Murdered_, but the children of the twenty, with others added to them, will know and love _Mark Rutherford_." The structure is complex but not confusing. 

Now, for coherence. The text discusses the contrast between popular and enduring literature, using examples like _Mark Rutherford_ and _Twice Murdered and Once Hung_. The flow is logical, moving from the initial scenario of a reader not having read _Mark Rutherford_ to broader literary criticism. 

Transitions between paragraphs: The shift from discussing the reader to the role of the critic is smooth. The mention of Sainte-Beuve and the comparison to classics like Homer and Virgil connects well with the previous discussion. 

However, there's a slight jump when introducing Mr. Augustine Birrell and the mention of George Borrow. It's not a major issue but could be a minor disconnect. Also, the part about the bookman's catholicity in subjects and the example of _Pilgrim’s Progress_ and A’Kempis is a bit abrupt after discussing the cathedral metaphor. 

Overall, the text maintains a clear argument about the enduring value of certain books versus others. The metaphors (cathedral vs. houses, stately merchantman vs. humble craft) are effective in conveying the idea. The conclusion about the bookman's collection ties back to the initial discussion, providing a cohesive structure.

For fluency, I might give a 4.5 because the text is mostly fluent with some complex sentences but no major errors. For coherence, a 4.5 as well, since the argument is clear and logical, with only minor transitions that could be smoother.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Overly complex sentence structures that may hinder readability. - [LEXICON] Archaic phrasing ("He is proudly conscious at the time") that feels slightly awkward. - [PUNCTUATION] Excessive use of commas in long sentences ("He is proudly conscious at the time that he is a witness to perfection in a gay world which is content with excitement, and he would be more than human if he had not in him a touch of the literary Pharisee").  
2) Coherence Issues: - [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Mr. Augustine Birrell to the French critic Sainte-Beuve without clear connection. - [STRUCTURE] Minor disconnect between the metaphor of "Cathedral" and the subsequent discussion of specific book collections (e.g., Pickering’s edition).  
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
