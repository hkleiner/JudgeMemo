Let me analyze the evaluation report and determine appropriate scores for coherence and fluency.

For FLUENCY:
- Section 01 has a score of 2.5 with multiple issues: grammar errors, syntax problems, spelling errors, punctuation issues, and lexical misuse.
- Section 02 also has a score of 2.5 with syntax issues, grammar problems, unclear word choices, and structural problems.
- Across both sections, there are frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structures that significantly impact readability. The text contains run-on sentences, jumbled syntax, and unclear word choices that make comprehension difficult.

For COHERENCE:
- Section 01 has a score of 2.5 with issues in transitions, structure, logic, and clarity. There are abrupt shifts between topics and confusing arguments.
- Section 02 has a slightly better score of 3.0 but still has coherence issues with disjointed sentences, abrupt topic shifts, and weak connections between ideas.
- Both sections show problems with logical progression and smooth transitions between ideas, with Section 02 showing slightly better organization.

Given the consistent low scores and recurring issues in both fluency and coherence across both sections, I would rate:

Fluency: 2.5 - The text has frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing structures that significantly impact readability. While not completely incoherent, the issues are numerous and make comprehension difficult in many parts.

Coherence: 2.5 - The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, and illogical sequencing. While Section 02 shows slightly better organization, both sections have problems with logical progression and smooth transitions between ideas.

Let me double-check my reasoning against the scales:

For Fluency Score 2.5 (between 2 and 3):
- The text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure.
- Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

For Coherence Score 2.5 (between 2 and 3):
- The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing.
- Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.

These scores align with the evaluation report and the descriptions provided.
