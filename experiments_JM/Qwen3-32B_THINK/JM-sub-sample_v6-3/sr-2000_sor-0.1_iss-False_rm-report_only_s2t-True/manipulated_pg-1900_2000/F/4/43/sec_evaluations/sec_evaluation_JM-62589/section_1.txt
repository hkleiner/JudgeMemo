Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the fluency and coherence of the provided text. The text is a chapter from a historical novel, "Molly, The Drummer Boy." 

Starting with fluency. I'll scan through for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling mistakes, or issues with word choice. 

Looking at the first paragraph, everything seems okay. Then in the line "He would not leave me, but even if he did he would come back, he always does!" There's a missing comma before "but" which makes it a run-on sentence. That's a [GRAMMAR] issue. 

Next, "It was quite plain, her father was to go also, out into that somewhere of silence and absence..." The phrase "out into that somewhere of silence and absence" is a bit awkward. Maybe "out into that place of silence and absence" would be better. So that's [LEXICON]. 

In the line "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes." The word "downcast" is correct, but maybe "with his eyes downcast" would be smoother. Not a big issue, but maybe a [SYNTAX] problem. 

Then there's a sentence that seems a bit off: "An Mason came yelling hit excitement joined oath head rabble the the, the and man with from bowed in." This part is a jumble of words. It's completely incoherent here. That's a major [GRAMMAR] and [STRUCTURE] issue. 

Moving on to coherence. The story is about Debby losing her father and being taken in by Mrs. Lane. The narrative flows from the initial scene with her father being drunk to the town's decision to remove him, then Debby's reaction. The transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth. 

However, the jumbled sentence I mentioned earlier breaks the flow. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue affecting coherence. Also, the shift from Debby's childhood to her time with Mrs. Lane is a bit abrupt. There's a paragraph that starts with "In the neat home..." which could have a smoother transition. That's a [TRANSITION] problem. 

Another point is the repetition of "hungered" in the line "It mattered little to Debby whether her father was Whig or Tory, no matter what he was she hungered for him day and night." The use of "hungered" twice might be redundant. That's a [LEXICON] issue. 

Also, the mention of the drum as a "concession" is a bit unclear. The word "concession" might not be the best choice here. Maybe "compromise" would fit better. So [LEXICON] again. 

Looking at the final paragraphs, the narrative wraps up Debby's time with Mrs. Lane and her longing for her father. The coherence here is okay, but the jumbled sentence and some awkward transitions do affect the overall flow. 

So, for fluency, the main issues are the jumbled sentence and a few grammatical and word choice problems. For coherence, the main issues are the jumbled sentence, some abrupt transitions, and a few unclear phrases. 

Now, assigning scores. Fluency: The jumbled sentence is a big problem, but the rest is mostly okay with minor issues. So maybe a 3.5. Coherence: The jumbled sentence is a major issue, but the rest flows reasonably well. So a 3.5 as well.

- [GRAMMAR] Run-on sentence and missing punctuation in "He would not leave me, but even if he did he would come back, he always does!"  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing in "out into that somewhere of silence and absence"  
- [STRUCTURE] Incoherent jumble in "An Mason came yelling hit excitement joined oath head rabble the the, the and man with from bowed in"  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward word order in "He arose clumsily and stood before the woman and girl with downcast eyes"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden, disjointed jumble in "An Mason came yelling..." disrupts narrative flow  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from Debbyâ€™s childhood to her time with Mrs. Lane lacks smooth connection

- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "concession" in "the concession her father had made to her desire"  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
