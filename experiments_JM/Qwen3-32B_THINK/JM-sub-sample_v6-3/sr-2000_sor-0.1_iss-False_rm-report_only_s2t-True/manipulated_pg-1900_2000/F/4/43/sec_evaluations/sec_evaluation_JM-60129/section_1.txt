Alright, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, looking at fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite old and might have some archaic language, but that's part of the style. However, I notice a few issues. There's a sentence that starts with "Our road led in a SE direction, past a temple..." – the hyphen in "SE" is okay, but maybe it should be "southeast" for clarity. Also, in the part about the village, there's a run-on sentence: "Some village eight or of chuang the the road, past first Ma the Yögur kilometres of of seven we dwellings the rode of scattered-south-tzu." This seems like a typo or a missing word. There are also some awkward phrasings, like "the outlines ol which could be discerned" – "ol" should be "of". Another example is "the great high road -- joining K'ou-li (the territory inside the Great Wall) and K'ou-wai..." The em dash here is correct, but the parentheses might be better as commas for smoother reading.

For coherence, I need to check the logical flow and transitions. The text starts describing the journey and then moves to the village and the Yögurs. There's a smooth transition there. However, when discussing the legend of Shiche-Hache, the connection to the main narrative is a bit abrupt. The mention of the temple's paintings and the lamas' education is detailed but could be more clearly linked to the previous sections. Also, the part about the local administration and tax collection is a bit disjointed, as it shifts focus without a clear transition. The mention of the written language and the lamas' inability to decipher the document might be confusing without more context.

Now, considering the scale. For fluency, the issues are mostly minor but there are a few awkward phrases and typos. So maybe a 4, as it's mostly fluent with some minor issues. For coherence, the text is generally logical but has some abrupt shifts and unclear transitions. A 4 might be appropriate here as well, since the main points are connected but not perfectly.
