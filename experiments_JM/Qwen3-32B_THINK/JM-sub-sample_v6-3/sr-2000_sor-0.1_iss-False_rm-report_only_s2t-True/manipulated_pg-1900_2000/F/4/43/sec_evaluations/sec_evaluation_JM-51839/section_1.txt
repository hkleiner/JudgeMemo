Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The text is a historical account of Nacogdoches, Texas, written in a somewhat formal and descriptive style. I need to look for issues related to grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I'll check for any obvious spelling mistakes. Scanning through the text, I don't notice any misspelled words. The names and terms like "Nacogdoches," "Tejas," and "Coronado" are spelled correctly. 

Next, grammar. There are some instances where the subject-verb agreement might be off. For example, in the line "The things that I remember arise, and hover," the verb "arise" is plural, but the subject is "things," which is correct. However, there might be some awkward phrasing. The line "I was The Gateway. Here they came, and passed," uses a period after "Gateway" which is a bit abrupt, but it's poetic and might be intentional given the context of a poem.

Looking at syntax and sentence structure, there are some complex sentences, especially in the historical narrative. For example, "For the beginnings of Nacogdoches we must go back to the shadowy times when heroic figures march with majestic tread across the stage of tradition, obscured by the mists of centuries." The structure here is a bit wordy and could be clearer, but it's still understandable. There's a mix of past and present tenses in some parts, which might be confusing. For example, "He commanded that immediately following his death, Natchitoches should gather his wife and children..." uses "should" which is a bit archaic but acceptable in historical writing.

Punctuation seems mostly correct. However, in the line "In an the of and the French eventful Guadalupe the between Province the (called of Texas Spanish for New mastery), struggle Philippines the Mission Eastern had history." There's a clear issue here. The sentence is a jumble of words without proper structure. This is a significant fluency problem because it's a run-on sentence that lacks coherence and makes the meaning unclear. This part needs to be addressed as a major issue.

Another example is "Deserted abandoned permanently location preserved ancient site, of utterly the Spanish its has our though finally parchments, been the Nacogdoches very its in was forgotten times decayed it but concerning archives never and information at." This sentence is a complete mess. It's a string of words without proper grammar or punctuation, making it impossible to understand. This is a critical fluency issue that would severely impact readability.

Looking at the rest of the text, the majority is well-written with proper grammar and structure. The historical narrative flows reasonably well, though some sentences are quite long. However, the two problematic sentences mentioned above are significant enough to lower the fluency score. These are clear cases of poor syntax and structure that hinder understanding.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence refers to how well the ideas are connected and how logically the text progresses. The text is divided into chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of Nacogdoches' history. Each chapter generally follows a logical sequence, moving from the indigenous origins to the Spanish and French influences.

However, there are some abrupt transitions between chapters. For example, after the poem in "Nacogdoches Speaks," the text jumps into the historical narrative of the Tejas Indians. While this is a shift from a poetic to a historical account, it's somewhat jarring. The connection between the poem and the subsequent historical narrative is not explicitly made, which could confuse the reader.

Another issue is in the section "First White Settlement." The paragraph about the mission and its history is followed by a sentence that is incoherent: "In an the of and the French eventful Guadalupe the between Province the (called of Texas Spanish for New mastery), struggle Philippines the Mission Eastern had history. Deserted abandoned permanently location preserved ancient site, of utterly the Spanish its has our though finally parchments, been the Nacogdoches very its in was forgotten times decayed it but concerning archives never and information at." This incoherent passage disrupts the flow and makes the overall coherence of that section questionable.

Additionally, the transition from the historical narrative to the Spanish town section is abrupt. After discussing the abandonment of the military post in 1773, the text jumps to the refounding in 1779 without much explanation or connection. While this is a factual progression, the lack of transitional phrases makes it feel disjointed.

The coherence is generally good, with the text maintaining a chronological order and covering different periods in the town's history. However, the incoherent sentence and the abrupt transitions are significant issues that affect the overall coherence.

In summary, the fluency issues are primarily the two incoherent sentences that are jumbled and lack proper grammar and structure. The coherence issues involve abrupt transitions between sections and the incoherent passage in the "First White Settlement" chapter. These problems would lower both the fluency and coherence scores.
