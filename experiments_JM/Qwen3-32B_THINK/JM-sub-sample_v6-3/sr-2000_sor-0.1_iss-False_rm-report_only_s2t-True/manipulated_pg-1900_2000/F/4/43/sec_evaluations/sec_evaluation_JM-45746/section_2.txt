Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll go through it sentence by sentence.

First, "A teacher should always be desirous of making a good personal impression..." The word "desirous" feels a bit formal and maybe a bit old-fashioned. Not sure if that's an issue, but it's a style choice. Next, "waiting at the big counter in the superintendent's office who were dressed more suitably for a social function..." The phrasing here is okay, but "big counter" might be redundant if "superintendent's office" already implies a counter. Maybe a minor issue with word choice.

Moving on, "Her attire was somewhat extreme and we decided it would be well to have her visit the principal..." "Somewhat extreme" is vague. Maybe "excessive" or "inappropriate" would be better. The sentence is clear, though. The next part about the principal reporting on "dress sense" is a bit abrupt. The transition from the story to the principal's report is okay, but could be smoother.

Then, "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted..." The phrase "drawing to a close" is a bit awkward. Maybe "approaching an end" would be better. The sentence is understandable, though. The next paragraph about general education and specialization is a bit dense. The sentence structure is complex but not incorrect. 

"In reading applications I have often noticed statements of this character given by one of the references:..." The phrasing here is a bit convoluted. Maybe splitting the sentence would help. The example quotes are in quotes but not properly formatted, which could be a formatting issue rather than a fluency one. 

"After a teacher has secured adequate general education and finds his 'bent,'..." The word "bent" is a bit old-fashioned and might not be commonly used, but it's clear in context. The sentence is okay. 

"In filling out application blanks teachers are sometimes careless..." The phrase "application blanks" is a bit old-fashioned. "Application forms" would be more modern. 

The last part about the young man and woman seeking positions is a bit abrupt in transition. The contrast between the two is clear, but the connection between the two stories is a bit sudden. 

Now for coherence. The text starts with the importance of personal impression, then moves to preparation and qualifications, then to application processes, and finally to examples of candidates. The flow is logical, but there are some jumps. For instance, after discussing the young woman's attire, it shifts to the need for good preparation. The connection between these points isn't explicitly made, which could be a coherence issue. 

The paragraph about the principal reporting on "dress sense" is a bit out of place. It's a specific example but the transition from the general to the specific is abrupt. Similarly, the shift from the need for general education to the examples of references is a bit sudden. 

The examples of the young man and woman are good, but the transition from the application process to their stories is abrupt. The text could benefit from a smoother transition here. 

Overall, the text is coherent but has some abrupt transitions and jumps in ideas. The fluency is mostly okay, with a few awkward phrases and old-fashioned terms, but nothing that hinders understanding. 

For fluency, I'd say minor issues with word choice and some awkward phrasing, but the text is mostly fluent. So a 4.5? Maybe a 4 if there are more issues. Let me check again. The example quotes are in quotes but not properly formatted with quotation marks. That's a formatting issue, not fluency. The sentences are generally clear. I'll go with 4 for fluency.

For coherence, the main issues are abrupt transitions and some disconnected ideas. The flow is logical but could be smoother. So maybe a 3.5? The text is generally coherent but has noticeable shifts. Yes, 3.5 for coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [LEXICON] Use of outdated or overly formal terms ("desirous," "bent," "application blanks")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in complex sentences ("In reading applications I have often noticed statements of this character given by one of the references")  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shifts between examples (e.g., from the young woman’s attire to the principal’s report)  
- [SPELLING] Minor inconsistencies in word choice ("big counter" vs. "superintendent’s office")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transitions between paragraphs (e.g., from "dress sense" to "mediocre preparation")  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the example of the commercial teacher and the broader argument about general education  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow between the young man’s and woman’s stories at the end  
- [CLARITY] Overly dense exposition in sections discussing qualifications and specialization  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
