Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues. The text is a chapter from a story, so I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

First, I notice some awkward phrasing. For example, "We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her sister dog, spends, suggested us wife I her my own Eileen Old, who be company from sheep when, a it of that having younger, would English no deal time good away with for an parents explaining of was home." This sentence is a mess. It's a run-on with incorrect word order and missing commas. The structure is confusing, making it hard to follow the intended meaning.

Another example is "I coldly recommended a mastiff." The word "coldly" is correct, but the sentence is cut off abruptly, which might be a typo for "colder" or "coldly," but the surrounding text is problematic. Also, "Our son John... was not again invited to participate in the debate." The phrasing here is okay, but the previous sentence about the sister dog is very confusing.

Looking for spelling errors, "dernier cri" is a French term used correctly here, but it's in italics. The rest seems okay, but some words like "spends" and "be" in the sister dog sentence are probably typos. Also, "We had eschewed a cab." "Eschewed" is correct, but maybe "eschew" is the base form. Wait, no, "eschewed" is the past tense, so that's correct. 

Syntax issues: The sentence about the sister dog is a run-on with incorrect structure. Also, "We simply asked for it," I rejoined. "What are we going to do next?" The dialogue tags are okay, but the surrounding sentences sometimes lack proper commas or have awkward punctuation.

Now for Coherence. The story is about the couple going to get a dog. The flow is generally logical, but there are some abrupt shifts. The sister dog part is confusing and doesn't connect well with the rest. It seems like a non-sequitur or a misplaced paragraph. The transition from discussing the dog breeds to the sister's suggestion is jarring. 

Another issue is the part where they follow the man to the Home for Lost Dogs. The description of their attempt to track him is a bit disjointed. The sentences about the undertaker's and butcher's windows are okay, but the overall narrative could be smoother. The mention of the sister's dog and Eileen Old is unclear and might not add to the story, causing confusion.

Also, the dialogue with the boy and the man in the uniform is clear, but the sister dog paragraph disrupts the flow. The coherence score would be affected by these confusing segments. The story is mostly logical, but the problematic sentences lower the overall coherence.

Putting it all together, Fluency has multiple grammatical and structural issues, especially in the sister dog part, leading to a score around 2.5. Coherence is affected by the confusing sections, so maybe a 3.
