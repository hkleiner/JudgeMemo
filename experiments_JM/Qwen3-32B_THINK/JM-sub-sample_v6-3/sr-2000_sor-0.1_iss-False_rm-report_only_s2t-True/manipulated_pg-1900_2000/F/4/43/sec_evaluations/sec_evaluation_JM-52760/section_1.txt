Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues. First, I notice some grammar problems. For example, in the line "Strategically, the found in 1864 Confederate, in the military Virginia the stronger the position despite of a stalemate Northern armies beginning than forces." This sentence is a mess. The structure is all over the place, and it's hard to parse. Then there's a part where it says "within by corked, Hundred, a the shut formed Army strongly in and Bermuda the inferior of, “2 had Confederate loop however force Appomattox in up numerically,” if James been, as a the winding bottle weeks James a it Rivers." That's completely nonsensical. The words are jumbled, and there's no clear meaning here. Spelling errors like "Appomattox" being misspelled as "Appomattox" in some places might be a typo, but it's hard to tell. There's also some awkward phrasing, like "the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." The phrase "upper arm" is a bit confusing in this context. 

Moving on to Coherence. The text starts by setting up the historical context of the Civil War, which is good. But then there's a sudden list of battles and movements without much explanation. It's a bit jarring. The section about the Army of the James has some confusing sentences. The part about Butler's advance and the mention of City Point is clear, but then there's that jumbled paragraph that makes it hard to follow. The transition from the general strategy to the specific battles is okay, but the jumbled text disrupts the flow. The explanation of Petersburg's strategic importance is clear, but the overall structure could be more cohesive. The text jumps between different topics without smooth transitions, which affects coherence.

For Fluency Score, considering the multiple grammar issues and the jumbled sentences, I'd say it's a 2.5. There are several errors that make reading difficult. For Coherence, the text has some logical flow but the jumbled parts and abrupt transitions bring it down to a 3.5. It's mostly coherent but with noticeable issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "Strategically, the found in 1864 Confederate, in the military Virginia the stronger the position despite of a stalemate Northern armies beginning than forces." (fragmented syntax, missing verbs/clarity).  
- [SPELLING] "within by corked, Hundred, a the shut formed Army strongly in and Bermuda the inferior of, “2 had Confederate loop however force Appomattox in up numerically,” if James been, as a the winding bottle weeks James a it Rivers." (nonsensical word salad).  
- [SYNTAX] "the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." (awkward phrasing; "upper arm" is unclear).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from narrative to a list of battles/movements without explanatory context.  
- [LOGIC] Jumbled paragraph about the Army of the James ("within by corked...") disrupts the flow and logical progression.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from Grant’s strategy to Petersburg’s strategic importance without clear linkage.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
