Alright, let's start evaluating this text for fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues**:

1. [GRAMMAR] "Astounded into that Boucherpaintings set, to the prepare at, struck him had Beauvais at the, him decorative and and youth took cartoons enthusiasm from work by his make Gobelins 's to studio the use his for progress artists their large to looms." This sentence is extremely grammatically incorrect and incoherent. It appears to be a jumbled mix of words without proper structure or meaning.

2. [GRAMMAR] "After young de with welfare' the 's in, ofown keen, under pupils training of and him his advantages that took urged he out master Boucher, and fellow Prix to that particularly, Fragonard the the to Rome years the of couple youth efforts, pointing for of a interest winning ever compete it." This sentence is also completely ungrammatical and incoherent, with no clear meaning or structure.

3. [SYNTAX] "The artist painted his picture "in little"; he was also required to paint an "enlargement" of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils, the State demanding, however, that the artist should work over it sufficiently to sign his name upon it--the head of the factory keeping custody of the "painting in little" to guide him; the weavers working from the enlargement." This sentence is very long and complex, making it difficult to follow the logical flow and understand the relationships between different parts.

4. [SPELLING] "Boucherpaintings" is a single word that should be "Boucher's paintings."

5. [PUNCTUATION] There are several places where punctuation is either missing or used incorrectly, making it difficult to parse the sentences properly.

6. [SYNTAX] "It was in this year that Boucher was given a studio and apartments at the Louvre." This sentence is grammatically correct but the placement of "in this year" at the beginning creates a slight awkwardness in phrasing.

7. [SYNTAX] "He continued to work in Boucher's studio, as well as painting on his own account; and it is to these years that belong his "Blind Man's Buff" and several pictures in this style." The structure of this sentence is somewhat awkward, with the phrase "it is to these years that belong" being more formal than the rest of the text.

8. [SPELLING] "Prix" should likely be "Prix de Rome" (a specific art competition) but is written as just "Prix" in the text.

**Coherence Issues**:

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from Fragonard's training to a completely unrelated paragraph about the king's quarrels with his parliament and the assassination of Damiens. There is no logical connection or transition between these topics.

2. [TRANSITION] The transition from the section about Fragonard's career to the section about the king's political conflicts is very abrupt and jarring. The reader is left wondering how these topics are connected.

3. [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is somewhat disjointed, with some information presented in a non-linear or unclear order. For example, the paragraph about Boucher's tapestry work is inserted in the middle of Fragonard's story without clear connection.

4. [CLARITY] The paragraph about Boucher's tapestry work is difficult to follow due to the complex sentence structure and lack of clear explanation. The relationship between the different elements of this process is not clearly articulated.

5. [LOGIC] The paragraph about the Director-General of Buildings and Abel Poisson de Vandi√®res is somewhat confusing in its chronology and relationships, making it difficult to follow the exact sequence of events and titles.

6. [COHERENCE] The text as a whole lacks a clear narrative thread in some places, with some information presented in a way that doesn't clearly connect to the overall story of Fragonard's development as an artist.

Based on my evaluation:

**Fluency Score**: 2.5/5
- The text contains several major grammatical errors, including two completely incoherent sentences.
- There are issues with spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure that make the text difficult to read in places.
- However, much of the text is still readable and has clear, well-written sections that demonstrate good fluency.

**Coherence Score**: 3/5
- The text has a generally coherent narrative about Fragonard's development as an artist.
- However, there are significant issues with logical flow and transitions, particularly the abrupt shift to the king's political conflicts at the end.
- Some paragraphs are difficult to follow due to complex sentence structures and lack of clear connections between ideas.
