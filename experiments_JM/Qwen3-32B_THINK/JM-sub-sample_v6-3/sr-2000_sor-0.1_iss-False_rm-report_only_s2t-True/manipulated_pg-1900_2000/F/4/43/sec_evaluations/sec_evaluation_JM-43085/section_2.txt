Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. The user wants me to look for issues in syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll scan through the text. The sentences are quite long, which is common in older or more formal writing. However, some of them are run-on sentences, making it a bit hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "Meissonier very shortly quitted..." runs on for a while without proper punctuation breaks. That's a [SYNTAX] issue.

Looking at grammar, there are a few instances where subject-verb agreement might be off. For example, "Meissonier very shortly quitted this somewhat dull discipline" – "quitted" is the past tense of "quit," but maybe "quit" is more commonly used in modern English. However, since the text is historical, it might be acceptable. Still, the use of "quitted" could be considered archaic and might be a [LEXICON] choice.

Next, there's a sentence that says, "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." The structure here is a bit confusing. The phrase "hired by the day soldiers..." seems to be missing a preposition. It should probably be "hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform..." but the structure is unclear. That's a [SYNTAX] problem.

Looking at the part where it says, "Be one's tastes never so modest, it is difficult under such conditions to make both ends meet..." This is a bit awkward. Maybe "No matter how modest one's tastes are..." would be smoother. This is a [PHRASING] issue.

There's also a sentence that starts with "When sixteen exhibited years of for, first the age Meissonier only time." This seems like a non-sequitur or a fragment. The structure here is completely off, making it hard to understand. That's a [SYNTAX] problem. Also, the phrase "sixteen exhibited years of for" doesn't make sense. It's possible there's a typo here, like "sixteen years of for" instead of "exhibited," which would be a [SPELLING] or [GRAMMAR] issue.

Another part is: "The face, rendered who that introduced time and he young for, youthful friend and so distrustful the him being importunate by had, publisher 'assured man a the had the nothing for him.'" This sentence is extremely confusing. The structure is all over the place, with no clear subject or verb. This is a major [SYNTAX] and [GRAMMAR] issue.

Now for coherence. The text is about Meissonier's early career, but some parts jump around in time or ideas without clear transitions. For example, after talking about his financial struggles, the text suddenly mentions his first exhibition in 1834. The transition between these sections is abrupt, making it a [TRANSITION] issue.

Also, the sentence about the art-publisher Curmer is confusing. The structure of the sentence is unclear, making it hard to follow the sequence of events. This is a [LOGIC] problem because the cause and effect aren't clear. 

Another issue is the part where it mentions the rejection by the magazine and then the encounter with Curmer. The connection between these events isn't well-explained, leading to a [CLARITY] issue. 

The text references the "Expedition into Egypt" as the ceiling painting for the Louvre, but it's unclear if this is a real historical piece or a fictional one. This could be a [STRUCTURE] issue if the context isn't properly set. 

The sentence about the "providential hazard" leading to a conversation about life-masks is a bit abrupt. The transition from being rejected to discussing life-masks is not smooth, which is a [TRANSITION] problem.

Putting it all together, the fluency issues are mainly in syntax and phrasing, with some grammar and spelling problems. The coherence issues are around transitions, logic, and clarity. The text is mostly readable but has enough issues to lower the scores from a 5. Let me assign the scores based on the criteria.
