Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. I need to look for issues like grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll go through the text line by line. The first paragraph seems okay, but then in the sentence about Reynolds choosing his friends, there's a part that says "in, have, many men, this enjoyed atmosphere intimate he of Garrick the mark and extraordinary must receptivity also world, Gibbon mind to made who his him served some of other and with in Goldsmith the advantage." That's a jumbled mess. The words are out of order, and it's hard to understand. That's a syntax problem.

Next, there's a sentence: "He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist, and his references to Gainsborough and Romney, whose success and accomplishments galled him not a little." The word "pettish" might be a typo for "petty," but I'm not sure. If it's correct, maybe it's a rare word choice, but if it's a typo, that's a spelling issue. However, the sentence structure here is complex but not necessarily incorrect.

Then there's a part: "He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people with whom he was brought into contact—witness the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought when he established himself in Leicester Square, the coach in which his unfortunate sister Frances was compelled to drive in order that the man in the street might stare open-mouthed and talk about her brother." The sentence is long but grammatically correct. No issues here.

The next paragraph: "There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,' or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene, who would commit such an offence to-day, and against these lapses from taste Sir Joshua's acquaintance with the best minds of his day failed to save him." The phrase "prime minister's salary" might be a bit awkward, but it's understandable. The sentence structure is complex but not incorrect.

In the last paragraph: "It to is see they more great as men interesting far lived." This is clearly a syntax error. The words are in the wrong order. It should probably be "It is to see them as men more interesting than great, far lived." That's a significant syntax issue affecting fluency.

So, the main fluency issues are the jumbled sentence with the friends and Garrick, the possible typo "pettish," and the last sentence's syntax error. These would lower the fluency score.

Now for coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The current section starts by talking about Reynolds' success and moves to his personal traits and friendships. Then it discusses his jealousy and vulgarity, comparing him to modern figures. The last paragraph shifts to the atmosphere of Leicester Square and the moral judgment of Reynolds. 

The transition from Reynolds' success to his personal traits is smooth. However, the paragraph about his friendships and the jumbled sentence might disrupt the flow. The mention of Dr. Johnson and other figures is a bit abrupt but still connected to the main topic. The last paragraph seems to introduce a new idea about the atmosphere of Leicester Square, which is a bit of a shift but still related to Reynolds' life. 

The main coherence issues are the jumbled sentences and the abrupt shift in the last paragraph. The text is generally coherent but has some parts that are confusing or disrupt the flow. The coherence score would be affected by these issues but not to the point of being incoherent overall.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentence structure in "in, have, many men, this enjoyed atmosphere intimate he of Garrick the mark and extraordinary must receptivity also world, Gibbon mind to made who his him served some of other and with in Goldsmith the advantage."  
- [SPELLING] Potential typo or rare word choice in "pettish" (context suggests "petty" might be intended).  
- [SYNTAX] Final sentence "It to is see they more great as men interesting far lived" is incoherent and grammatically incorrect.  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Reynolds’ personal traits to a modern comparison ("There is hardly a 'Lion Comique,'...") without clear transition.  
- [LOGIC] Disjointed flow in the paragraph about Reynolds’ friendships and influences, lacking clear connections between ideas.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous phrasing in "the living served him as well as the dead," which is vague and requires reader inference.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
