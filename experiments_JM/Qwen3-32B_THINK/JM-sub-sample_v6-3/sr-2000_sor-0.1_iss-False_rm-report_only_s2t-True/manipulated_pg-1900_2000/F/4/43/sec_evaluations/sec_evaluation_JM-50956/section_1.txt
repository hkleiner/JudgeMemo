Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency section. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I notice that the text is quite formal and old-fashioned, but there are some issues. For example, in the sentence "Russia at present lies in seas of blood and tears because of her enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Prussian militarism," the phrase "seas of blood and tears" is a bit of a cliché, but it's still understandable. The grammar here seems okay. 

Looking further, there's a sentence: "The nightmare of Bolshevism was able to overtake Russia because she was exhausted by three years of active participation in the War, during which her casualties reached 12,000,000, and her economic life became overstrained and partially destroyed." The structure is a bit long, but it's not too bad. 

Wait, here's a problem: "If Russia had not sacrificed 3,000,000 of her best youth, now sleeping on the battle-fields of Europe, a Prussian bayonet would now be ruling the world." The comma after "Europe" might be a misplaced punctuation. Also, "battle-fields" is hyphenated, which is correct. 

Another issue: "Russia's losses are more than twice the total strength of the British Army, and three-four times all the forces mustered by the United States." The hyphen in "three-four" should probably be "three to four" or "three or four" for clarity. 

In the part about the author: "The author of this pamphlet, Colonel C. M. Shumsky-Solomonov, is an officer of the Russian Army, a distinguished soldier and an authority on military problems." The list here is a bit run-on, but it's acceptable. 

Now, checking for spelling errors: "Birjeviya Viedomosti" – the spelling here is as given, so probably correct. "Bayonet" is spelled correctly. "Bolshevism" is correct. 

Looking at the sentence: "The role played by Russia and the services the Russian Armies rendered in the struggle against Prussian Imperialism can be seen further from the fact that during the spring of 1917 there were 162 German and Austrian divisions engaged on the Russian front alone, while on all the other Allied fronts together there were 205 German and Austrian divisions." The structure is a bit complex but grammatically correct. 

In the second chapter: "In discussing Russia's role in the past World War, it is customary to cite the losses sustained by the Russian Army, losses numbering many millions." The repetition of "losses" is a bit awkward but not a major issue. 

The sentence: "Therefore at the end of the War three years of effort on the part of Russia, which had devoured the enemy's forces, were destined to enable the Allies finally to crush the enemy." The structure is a bit convoluted but still understandable. 

Now, looking at the problematic part in the second chapter: "It is of to Russia was which the took to period from during unprepared Russia mobilize it fact forces a, six for months two weeks that armed action." This sentence is a complete mess. The words are jumbled and incoherent. It's not clear what the author is trying to say here. This is a major fluency issue. 

So, the main fluency issues are the jumbled sentence in the second chapter and a few minor issues like hyphenation and word choice. 

For Coherence, I need to check the logical flow and how ideas are connected. The text is a historical analysis, so the structure should be logical. The first chapter introduces the author and the purpose, then discusses Russia's role in the war with specific examples. The second chapter starts by discussing the measurement of Russia's role, then moves into whether Germany could have won. 

The jumbled sentence in the second chapter disrupts the coherence. Also, the transition between the first and second chapters is abrupt. The first chapter ends with a conclusion about Russia's role, and the second chapter starts with a new question. There's a lack of smooth transition. 

Another point: The text references "Prussian militarism" and "Prussian Imperialism" interchangeably, which might confuse readers if they're not the same. The author should clarify if these are different concepts. 

The overall structure is mostly logical, but the jumbled sentence and abrupt transitions are problematic. 

So, the coherence issues include the jumbled sentence, abrupt transitions, and potential confusion in terminology. 

Now, assigning scores. For Fluency: the jumbled sentence is a major issue, but the rest is mostly okay with minor issues. That would be a 3.5. For Coherence: the jumbled sentence and transitions are significant, so maybe a 3.5 as well. But the jumbled sentence is a major problem, so maybe lower it to 3.0 for both. Wait, the scale for fluency: 3 is "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity." The jumbled sentence is a major issue, so maybe a 3.0. For Coherence: 3.0 as well, since the main issue is the jumbled sentence and transitions. 

Wait, the jumbled sentence is in the second chapter. The rest of the text is coherent. So maybe Coherence is 4.0, but the jumbled sentence is a major problem. Hmm. The coherence scale for 3 is "noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments." The jumbled sentence is a confusing segment, and the transition between chapters is abrupt. So Coherence would be 3.0. Fluency is 3.0 because of the jumbled sentence and a few minor issues.
