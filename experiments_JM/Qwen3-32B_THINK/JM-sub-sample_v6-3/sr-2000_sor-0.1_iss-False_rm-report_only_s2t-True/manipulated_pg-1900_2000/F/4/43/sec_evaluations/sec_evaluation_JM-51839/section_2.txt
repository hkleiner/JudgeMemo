Alright, let's start by carefully reading the provided text and evaluating it for fluency and coherence. The text is a historical account of Nacogdoches and related events, so I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or structural issues that affect fluency. For coherence, I'll look at how well the ideas flow and connect logically within the section.

First, looking at the Fluency Issues:

1. **Sentence Fragment**: The sentence "It primarily its that as a has and, a as throughout main erected of; use been commerce house varied its fort but not was history." is a jumbled fragment with incorrect word order and punctuation. This is a major issue affecting readability.

2. **Awkward Phrasing**: The phrase "the eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity, somewhere between the Sabine and Red rivers" is somewhat awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

3. **Redundancy**: The sentence "Louisiana belonged to Spain, and the government was but little concerned to mark out definitely the exact limitation between its provinces" is a bit redundant and could be more concise.

4. **Grammar Errors**: "He promulgated the first Book of Ordinances for the government of the city in 1780, the original of which is now in the Nacogdoches Archives in the Capitol at Austin." has a misplaced modifier that could confuse the reader.

5. **Run-on Sentence**: "The result of the investigation was the removal of Ybarbo from his office; he was sent to Bexar while the investigation proceeded." is a run-on sentence that could be split for better readability.

6. **Awkward Transition**: The transition from the history of Ybarbo to the population growth of the city is somewhat abrupt.

7. **Grammatical Error**: "The population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant M. Musquiz and his Garrison" has a subject-verb agreement error ("population" is singular, so "was" should be used instead of "were").

8. **Awkward Phrase**: "In the beginning of the new century the purchase of Louisiana by the United States from the French, in consequence of the Napoleonic upheaval in Europe, brought about a great change in the political and military affairs of Nacogdoches." is a long and complex sentence that could be simplified.

9. **Punctuation Error**: "There was great jealousy between the two countries, and a territorial dispute to be settled." could use a semicolon instead of a comma to better connect the two independent clauses.

10. **Awkward Phrase**: "One of the local leaders was a Spanish woman, Gertrudis Leal, and her husband, Antonio Leal, who were tried for treason by Musquiz." has a subject-verb agreement issue ("One of the local leaders was... and her husband, Antonio Leal, who were tried...").

For Coherence Issues:

1. **Abrupt Transition**: The transition from the history of the city to the Philip Nolan chapter is abrupt and could use a smoother connection.

2. **Disjointed Paragraph**: The paragraph about the Philip Nolan expedition begins with a sentence fragment "Nolan had James commander reared been General the, United forces Natchez by of Wilkinson States at, Mississippi." This is a significant disruption in the flow.

3. **Unclear Reference**: The reference to "the eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity" is somewhat unclear without more context about the specific time period.

4. **Missing Context**: The text references "the suppression of Philip Nolanâ€™s expedition" without fully explaining the expedition itself, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the event.

5. **Chronological Confusion**: The text jumps between different time periods without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the chronological progression.

6. **Unclear Connection**: The connection between the purchase of Louisiana and the changes in Nacogdoches is not clearly explained.

7. **Abrupt Shift in Focus**: The text shifts from the history of the city to the specific event of Philip Nolan's expedition without a smooth transition.

8. **Confusing Sentence Structure**: The sentence "In furtherance of the schemes of Wilkinson and Aaron Burr (then Vice President of the United States), Nolan invaded Texas with a small band of adventurers, on the pretext of horse-trading." is confusing and could be restructured for clarity.

9. **Ambiguous Reference**: The phrase "the two countries" in "There was great jealousy between the two countries, and a territorial dispute to be settled." is ambiguous without clear identification of which countries are being referenced.

10. **Unclear Causal Link**: The causal link between the Napoleonic upheaval and the purchase of Louisiana is not clearly explained.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations.

For Fluency: The text has several significant issues, including a major sentence fragment, multiple grammatical errors, and some awkward phrasing. However, much of the text is well-written and readable. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but has multiple issues that disrupt the flow.

For Coherence: The text has some logical progression but contains abrupt transitions, unclear references, and disjointed sections. The shift between topics is sometimes jarring, and some connections are not well-explained. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally coherent but has noticeable issues with transitions and clarity.

Let me review my assessment one more time to ensure accuracy:

- Fluency: The text has several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and one major sentence fragment. However, much of it is still readable.
- Coherence: The text has some logical progression but suffers from abrupt transitions, unclear references, and disjointed sections.

Based on these observations, I believe the scores are accurate.
