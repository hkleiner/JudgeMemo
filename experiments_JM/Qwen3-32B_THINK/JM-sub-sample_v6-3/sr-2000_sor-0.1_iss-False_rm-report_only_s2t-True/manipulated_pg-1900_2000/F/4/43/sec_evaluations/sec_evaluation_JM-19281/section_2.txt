Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "On of in the, the hand cause have the peace one perceptions of promotion international individual search arousing justice and to the the for effect also of of tend thenew 's role society." - This sentence is completely ungrammatical and incoherent.

2. [SYNTAX] "The phenomenon gather is of forces steadily the product historical that momentum." - This sentence has incorrect word order and is ungrammatical.

3. [SPELLING] "fulfilment" - This is a British spelling variation, but it's not a major issue.

4. [SPELLING] "thenew 's" - Should be "the new's" with a space.

5. [GRAMMAR] "The phenomenon gather is of forces steadily the product historical that momentum." - This sentence is grammatically incorrect with multiple issues.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [LOGIC] The sentence "On of in the, the hand cause have the peace one perceptions of promotion international individual search arousing justice and to the the for effect also of of tend thenew 's role society." - This sentence is completely incoherent and doesn't logically connect to the surrounding text.

2. [STRUCTURE] The paragraph containing the incoherent sentence disrupts the logical flow of the text.

3. [CLARITY] The transition from discussing the spiritual search to the incoherent sentence and then back to coherent content is jarring and confusing.

4. [TRANSITION] The transition to the section about the materialist enterprise is abrupt after the incoherent sentence.

5. [LOGIC] The text jumps from discussing spiritual movements to discussing materialist enterprises without clear transitional phrases.

Now I'll rate the text:

**Fluency Score:** The text has a few major grammatical issues (particularly the completely incoherent sentence) that severely disrupt reading. There are also some minor spelling and syntax issues. I would rate this a 2.5 - it's generally readable but has some significant problems.

**Coherence Score:** The text is mostly coherent in its overall argument about the reawakening of interest in religion and the failure of materialism. However, the presence of a completely incoherent sentence significantly disrupts the flow and logical progression of the text. I would rate this a 3.5 - it's generally coherent but has some noticeable issues.
