Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues according to the evaluation criteria.

## FLUENCY ANALYSIS

The text contains several issues that affect fluency:

1. [SPELLING] "ith" should be "is"
2. [SPELLING] "lisped" should be "lisp" or "lisped" (depending on intended tense)
3. [SPELLING] "darn" is misspelled as "darn"
4. [SPELLING] "Irwadian's" should be "Irwadians"
5. [SPELLING] "thith" should be "this"
6. [SPELLING] "Tranthfer Thervith" should be "Transfer Service"
7. [SPELLING] "ecth-captain" should be "ex-captain"
8. [SPELLING] "ecthra-planetarieth" should be "extra-planetaries"
9. [SPELLING] "ecthra-planetarieth" should be "extra-planetaries"
10. [SPELLING] "ecthra-planetarieth" should be "extra-planetaries"
11. [SPELLING] "Ramsey fastened of walked weather head the-down hunched, and toggles into cape his his the put, his shoulders cold teeth and of the wind." - This sentence is completely incoherent and has multiple spelling and grammatical issues
12. [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey fastened of walked weather head the-down hunched..." - This sentence structure is completely incorrect and incoherent
13. [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey fastened of walked..." - The verb tenses and sentence structure are incorrect
14. [GRAMMAR] "fastened of walked weather head the-down hunched, and toggles into cape his his the put, his shoulders cold teeth and of the wind." - The sentence is grammatically incoherent
15. [GRAMMAR] "he had read Chind Ramar's mind; a feat growing less rare although by no means common yet among the offspring..." - The sentence structure is awkward and confusing
16. [SPELLING] "SoRamsey" should be "So Ramsey"
17. [GRAMMAR] "about SoRamsey of finished that 's it," the size." - This sentence is incoherent and has grammatical issues
18. [SPELLING] "Arcturan-earthian" should be "Arcturian-Earthian" or similar
19. [GRAMMAR] "Not today, Sally," - This is an incomplete sentence that ends the dialogue
20. [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format..." - This is not part of the text to evaluate, but I'm including it for completeness

## COHERENCE ANALYSIS

The text is a science fiction story about an Earthman named Jason Ramsey who is dealing with the planetarization of the Interstellar Transfer Service on the planet Irwadi. The story has a clear narrative about the conflict between Earthmen and the Irwadians, and the consequences of the planetarization policy.

However, there are some coherence issues:

1. [LOGIC] The incoherent sentence about Ramsey fastening his cape is confusing and disrupts the narrative flow
2. [LOGIC] The sentence about "about SoRamsey of finished that 's it," the size." at the end is completely incoherent and does not fit with the rest of the story
3. [STRUCTURE] The story has a clear structure, but the incoherent sentences disrupt the flow
4. [CLARITY] The sentence about reading minds and cosmic radiation is somewhat unclear in its meaning
5. [LOGIC] The final sentence fragment "Not today, Sally," is incomplete and disrupts the narrative

Now, I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

## FLUENCY SCORE

The text has multiple spelling and grammatical errors, some of which are quite severe (especially the completely incoherent sentence about Ramsey fastening his cape). These errors would significantly impact the readability of the text.

According to the scale:
- Score 5: Highly fluent with minimal to no grammatical issues
- Score 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues
- Score 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues
- Score 2: Contains frequent errors that make comprehension difficult
- Score 1: Largely unintelligible

Given the multiple serious issues, particularly the completely incoherent sentence, I would rate the fluency as a 2.5.

## COHERENCE SCORE

The story has a clear narrative and logical progression, with some minor issues. The incoherent sentence and the final sentence fragment disrupt the flow, but the rest of the story maintains coherence.

According to the scale:
- Score 5: Highly coherent with clear logical progression
- Score 4: Mostly coherent with a few weak parts
- Score 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts
- Score 2: Has frequent inconsistencies or disconnected ideas
- Score 1: Largely incoherent with disjointed segments

Given the story has a clear narrative but with a couple of significant disruptions, I would rate the coherence as a 3.5.

Let me double-check my analysis and scores to make sure they align with the evaluation criteria.

For fluency:
- The text has multiple spelling errors, grammatical errors, and one completely incoherent sentence that would significantly impact readability
- This aligns with a score of 2.5 (between 2 and 3)

For coherence:
- The story has a clear narrative and logical progression, with a couple of significant disruptions
- This aligns with a score of 3.5 (between 3 and 4)

I'll now format my response according to the requested format.
