Alright, I need to evaluate the current text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The text has several issues. First, there are grammatical errors. For example, "It men urged to be will scientific the viewscope widened 's that of Spencer explanation." That sentence doesn't make sense. The structure is off. Then there's "Was as that to main contribution he not regarded his it this himself philosophy?" This is a run-on sentence with incorrect word order. Also, "Did he not himself provide a summary, setting forth the sixteen articles of the Spencerian creed..." The phrasing here is awkward and confusing. These are all [GRAMMAR] issues.

Next, syntax problems. The sentence "But even here 'specifically stated, the problem is to interpret mental evolution in terms of the redistribution of matter and motion'." The placement of the quote and the syntax is confusing. Also, "If all existence, distinguishable as subjective, is resolvable into units of consciousness, which in their obverse or objective aspect are oscillations of molecules..." The structure is complex and hard to follow. These are [SYNTAX] issues.

Spelling mistakes: "viewscope" is likely a typo for "viewscope" but even then, it's unclear. Also, "Spencerian creed" is correct, but "viewscope" is definitely an issue. [SPELLING].

Now for coherence. The text jumps between different ideas without clear transitions. For example, after discussing Spencer's philosophy, it suddenly shifts to the problem of mental evolution and then to the antithesis of subject and object. This is a [TRANSITION] issue. Also, the text references "the Nonconformist letters" and "First Principles" without sufficient context, making it hard to follow. [CLARITY]. The argument about Spencer's philosophy being all-inclusive is presented but not clearly connected to the earlier points about social and political developments. [LOGIC]. There's also some repetition, like the emphasis on Matter, Motion, and Force, which is mentioned multiple times without adding new information. [STRUCTURE].

The final paragraph about Matter and Mind is a quote but is presented abruptly without context. [CLARITY]. The overall structure of the text is somewhat logical but the transitions between paragraphs and ideas are abrupt, leading to a disjointed feel. [STRUCTURE].

For the fluency score, there are multiple grammatical and syntax issues that disrupt reading. The text is understandable but requires effort. So maybe a 2.5. Coherence has some logical progression but the transitions and clarity issues bring it down. A 3 seems appropriate.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "It men urged to be will scientific the viewscope widened 's that of Spencer explanation" (subject-verb agreement, nonsensical phrasing).  
- [SYNTAX] "Was as that to main contribution he not regarded his it this himself philosophy?" (run-on sentence, inverted word order).  
- [SPELLING] "viewscope" (likely a typo, but unclear in context).  
- [GRAMMAR] "Did he not himself provide a summary, setting forth the sixteen articles of the Spencerian creed..." (awkward phrasing, missing punctuation).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from social/political doctrines to "philosophy of life and mind" without clear linkage.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear references to "Nonconformist letters" and "First Principles" without contextual explanation.  
- [LOGIC] Disconnected argument about Spencer's "all-inclusive" interpretation and its relation to biology/psychology.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetitive emphasis on "Matter, Motion, and Force" without resolving earlier contradictions.  
- [CLARITY] Final quoted lines ("We can think of Matter only in terms of Mind...") introduced without context or transition.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
