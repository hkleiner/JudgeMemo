Alright, let me break this down.

For Coherence, the report points out several issues across both sections. In section_01, there's an abrupt shift from Spencer's philosophical critique to his contributions in Biology/Psychology without clear linkage, and the final paragraph is disjointed. The structure has overly long paragraphs with dense ideas. In section_02, there's another abrupt shift from social/political doctrines to the "philosophy of life and mind," unclear references to specific works, and the final quoted lines are introduced without context. The argument about Spencer's interpretation is disconnected. The structure also has repetitive emphasis without resolving contradictions. These are recurring and significant issues in transitions, clarity, logic, and structure, which would lower the coherence score. Considering these, a 2.5 seems appropriate as it indicates frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that affect the flow.

For Fluency, the report notes grammar issues like incoherent phrasing and non-sensical sentences, syntax problems with awkward structures, and spelling errors. In section_01, there are examples of both grammar and syntax issues. Section_02 adds spelling errors and more grammar problems. These errors are frequent enough to disrupt readability. The sentences are often awkward or nonsensical, making comprehension difficult. This aligns with a score of 2.5, as the text has frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that interrupt the flow and clarity.

So, the final scores would be 2.5 for both Coherence and Fluency.
