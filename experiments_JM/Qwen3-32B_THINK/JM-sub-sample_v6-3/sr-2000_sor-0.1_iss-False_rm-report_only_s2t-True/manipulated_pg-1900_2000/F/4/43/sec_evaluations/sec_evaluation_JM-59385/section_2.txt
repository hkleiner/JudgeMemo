Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] "In drifted crunching roses sound foreign had fragrant the principal and and the talk tenseness recalled in the the arbor she, out path again sit France she hadas to as voice Porter her spoken asking Kuei stiff of shoes, ’s the la and Miss shewalk the memory with down the, perfume end at come the of her ’s made of to the came Ping." - This sentence is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect.
- [SPELLING] "hadas" - This appears to be a spelling error, likely "had as"
- [SYNTAX] "the la and Miss shewalk" - This is a syntax error; likely "la" should be "laugh" and "shewalk" should be "she walk"
- [SYNTAX] "the memory with down the, perfume end at come the of her ’s made of to the came Ping." - This sentence has incorrect syntax and structure

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] The sentence "In drifted crunching roses sound foreign had fragrant the principal and and the talk tenseness recalled in the the arbor she, out path again sit France she hadas to as voice Porter her spoken asking Kuei stiff of shoes, ’s the la and Miss shewalk the memory with down the, perfume end at come the of her ’s made of to the came Ping." - This entire sentence is incoherent and doesn't follow logically from the previous text.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps abruptly from Kuei Ping's memory of Miss Porter to the incoherent sentence about France and then back to the coherent narrative.
- [CLARITY] The transition from the coherent narrative to the incoherent sentence and back is confusing and disrupts the flow of the story.

Now, let me assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has one sentence that is completely incoherent and grammatically incorrect, as well as several other minor issues. These issues significantly impact the readability of the text. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text is generally readable but contains significant grammatical and structural issues that disrupt the flow.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has a major incoherent sentence that disrupts the logical progression of the narrative. There are also issues with the structure and transitions between ideas. This significantly impacts the coherence of the text. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text has noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me review these scores again to make sure they're appropriate:

Fluency: 2.5 - The text has one major incoherent sentence and several other minor issues that significantly impact readability.
Coherence: 2.5 - The text has a major incoherent section and noticeable abrupt shifts that affect the reading experience.

I think these scores are appropriate based on the evaluation criteria provided.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "In drifted crunching roses sound foreign had fragrant the principal and and the talk tenseness recalled in the the arbor she, out path again sit France she hadas to as voice Porter her spoken asking Kuei stiff of shoes, ’s the la and Miss shewalk the memory with down the, perfume end at come the of her ’s made of to the came Ping." 
- [SPELLING] "hadas"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Incoherent sentence about France and perfume disrupts narrative flow
- [STRUCTURE] Narrative jumps abruptly from Kuei Ping's memory to incoherent section
- [CLARITY] Confusing transition between coherent narrative and incoherent section

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
