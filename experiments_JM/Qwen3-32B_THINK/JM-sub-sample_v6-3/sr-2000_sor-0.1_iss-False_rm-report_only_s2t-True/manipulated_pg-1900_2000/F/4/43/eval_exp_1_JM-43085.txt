Alright, let's look at the evaluation report to determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency. 

Starting with **Fluency**, the scores are 3.5 in section_01 and 3.0 in section_02. The issues listed for both sections include syntax problems, grammar issues, and punctuation errors. In section_01, there are examples of incoherent word order and disjointed structure. In section_02, there are run-on sentences, ambiguous phrasing, and subject-verb agreement issues. These issues are recurring and somewhat severe, affecting the readability. However, the scores are not extremely low, so it's not a 2 or 1. The frequent errors and noticeable problems would likely place the overall fluency score around 3.0, since the second section has a lower score and more issues.

For **Coherence**, the scores are 3.5 in both sections. The issues listed include logic problems, abrupt transitions, structural problems, and clarity issues. In both sections, there are shifts without clear connections, unclear cause-effect relationships, and disjointed sequences. These problems are present in both sections and impact the overall flow and understanding of the text. The coherence scores are consistent at 3.5, suggesting that while there are noticeable issues, they're not as severe as to drop the score below 3.5.

Considering the recurring issues across both sections for both metrics, the final scores would likely be:

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0

This reflects the consistent issues in both sections, with fluency being slightly more problematic due to the lower score in the second section.
