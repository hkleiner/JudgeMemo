I'll evaluate the provided text according to the given criteria for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll analyze the text for fluency issues:

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] "And could have not age produced this them." - This sentence has incorrect word order and is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "The uneasiness people everywhere in the in movement to until walked about, subject a fearsomely was thought land, as spread and therein of realm earthquakes." - This sentence is a jumbled mess with incorrect word order and missing prepositions.
- [GRAMMAR] "Letground we raze and the 's, shall feel everything safer to then." - This sentence has incorrect word order and is grammatically incoherent.
- [GRAMMAR] "It full faith in, problems never greatest, to a necessary a satisfactory in existence can which, spite up the, science warning it faith of universe of it including gives philosophers that admits faith some Spencer of sort Herbert is despises its of solve." - This is an incoherent jumble of words with no clear meaning or grammatical structure.
- [SPELLING] "ebullition" appears to be misspelled as "ebullition" (it's actually spelled correctly).
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation throughout the text, especially in long, complex sentences.

Now, I'll analyze the text for coherence issues:

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] The text discusses the impact of 19th-century scientists on Christmas traditions but then makes an abrupt shift to discussing "the uneasiness people everywhere in the in movement to until walked about, subject a fearsomely was thought land, as spread and therein of realm earthquakes" - this is illogical and disconnected from the previous discussion.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks a clear structure and logical progression. It jumps from one idea to another without clear connections.
- [CLARITY] The text often fails to express ideas clearly, especially in the latter half where it becomes increasingly incoherent.
- [TRANSITION] There are no effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas, making the text feel disjointed.
- [LOGIC] The final paragraph about "the Christmas spirit" is disconnected from the previous discussion about science and skepticism.
- [CLARITY] The text frequently uses complex or abstract language in ways that obscure meaning rather than clarify it.

Based on my analysis:

For fluency, the text has numerous serious grammatical errors and incoherent sentence structures that make it difficult to understand. While there are some readable parts, the overall fluency is significantly impaired.

For coherence, the text has major issues with logical progression and connection between ideas. It jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions and often fails to express ideas clearly.

Now I'll assign scores:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has numerous grammatical errors and incoherent sentence structures that significantly impair readability. While some parts are understandable, the overall fluency is severely compromised. This would place it somewhere between a 2 and 3 on the scale.

I'll give it a score of 2.5 because while it's not completely unintelligible, it has frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that make comprehension difficult.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has major issues with logical progression and connection between ideas. It jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions and often fails to express ideas clearly. While there is some thematic consistency around Christmas and skepticism, the execution is disjointed.

This would place it between a 2 and 3 on the scale. I'll give it a score of 2.5 because while there is some coherence in the general theme, the execution is frequently confusing and disjointed.

Let me finalize my evaluation form:

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "And could have not age produced this them." (incorrect word order)
- [GRAMMAR] "The uneasiness people everywhere in the in movement to until walked about..." (jumbled syntax)
- [GRAMMAR] "Letground we raze and the 's, shall feel everything safer to then." (incoherent phrasing)
- [GRAMMAR] "It full faith in, problems never greatest..." (incoherent jumble)
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or incorrect punctuation throughout complex sentences

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from discussion of 19th-century scientists to "uneasiness people everywhere..."
- [STRUCTURE] Lacks clear structure with disconnected ideas and paragraphs
- [CLARITY] Frequently uses complex/abstract language that obscures meaning
- [TRANSITION] No effective transitions between paragraphs or ideas
- [LOGIC] Final paragraph about Christmas spirit feels disconnected from earlier discussion

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
