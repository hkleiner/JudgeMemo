Alright, let's analyze the evaluation report for the text and determine the final Coherence and Fluency scores.

First, I'll summarize the key issues and scores for each section:

**Section 1 (Chars 0–8144):**
- Fluency Score: 2.5
  - Issues: Run-on sentences with missing punctuation, fragmented sentences, subject-verb agreement errors, non-standard phrasing/archaic terms, and ambiguous word choices.
- Coherence Score: 3.5
  - Issues: Abrupt shifts between anecdotes and ideas, unclear connections between examples and the central argument, weak transitions between paragraphs, and convoluted phrasing obscuring meaning.

**Section 2 (Chars 8144–11574):**
- Fluency Score: 4.5
  - Issues: Overly complex sentence structures, archaic phrasing, and excessive commas in long sentences.
- Coherence Score: 4.5
  - Issues: Sudden shift from discussing Mr. Augustine Birrell to the French critic Sainte-Beuve, and a minor disconnect between a metaphor and the subsequent discussion.

Now, I'll determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency:

**For Coherence:**
Section 1 has more significant issues with coherence, including abrupt shifts, unclear connections, and weak transitions. Section 2 shows better coherence with only minor issues (sudden shift and metaphor disconnect). The first section has a score of 3.5 while the second has 4.5. Given that the first section has more serious coherence problems that affect the overall reading experience, I would average these scores but lean slightly towards the lower score since coherence is crucial for overall understanding. A fair assessment would be a score of 4.0 for Coherence.

**For Fluency:**
Section 1 has major fluency issues with run-on sentences, fragmented sentences, and significant grammatical errors, resulting in a score of 2.5. Section 2 has better fluency with a score of 4.5, but still has some issues with complex sentence structures and archaic phrasing. The significant drop in fluency in the first section would heavily impact the overall fluency of the text. A fair assessment would be a score of 3.5 for Fluency.

I'll now format my final answer according to the required format.
