Let me carefully analyze this evaluation report to determine the final fluency and coherence scores.

For FLUENCY:
- Section 01 has a fluency score of 2.5 with multiple spelling and grammar issues.
- Section 02 also has a fluency score of 2.5 with various grammar problems.
- The text contains numerous spelling errors like "ith" instead of "is", "lisped" instead of "lisp", etc.
- There are many grammatical errors and incoherent sentence structures.
- The text has issues with word choice and phrasing that make reading difficult.

For COHERENCE:
- Section 01 has a coherence score of 3.5 with some logical issues and unclear transitions.
- Section 02 has a coherence score of 2.5 with more significant problems.
- The text has abrupt shifts in narrative, disconnected ideas, and disjointed transitions.
- There are logical inconsistencies like Ramsey's sudden appearance at the gambling hall without explanation.
- Some descriptions seem tangential and disconnected from the main narrative.

Looking at the overall pattern across both sections:
- Fluency has consistent issues in both sections, with frequent spelling and grammar problems that make reading difficult.
- Coherence problems increase from section 1 to section 2, with more significant disruptions in narrative flow and logical sequencing.

Based on the evaluation criteria:
For FLUENCY: The text has frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure in both sections. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort. This aligns with a score of 2.
For COHERENCE: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort. This aligns with a score of 2.5.

I'll provide these scores in the requested format.
