Let me evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence.

First, I'll check for fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):

Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "Ramsey'm I," sorry said. "Were you talking to me?" - This sentence has incorrect grammar. It should be "Ramsey'm I," he said. "Were you talking to me?"
- [GRAMMAR] "I thertainly wath," - This is a misspelling of "I certainly was."
- [GRAMMAR] "I thaid I won't have any Earthman thnooping over my thoulder while I gamble, not unleth he'th gambling too." - This has multiple misspellings (thaid = said, thnooping = snooping, thoulder = shoulder, unleth = unless, he'th = he's).
- [GRAMMAR] "In all the time he'd spent on Irwadi, he'd never been able to tell a native's age by his green, scale-skinned, fish-eyed poker-face." - The phrase "fish-eyed poker-face" is awkward and could be more clearly phrased.
- [GRAMMAR] "Since and of and outworlders the his Ramsey them the thought, full should, have to, catered was ominous silence been both establishment in favor." - This sentence is completely incoherent and appears to be a garbled version of a sentence about the silence in the gambling hall.
- [GRAMMAR] "He looked around. Outworlders, yes. But not another Earthman present." - This transition is somewhat abrupt.

Now, for coherence issues (logical sequence, non-repetitive ideas, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, consistency, and structure):

Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text abruptly shifts from Ramsey giving money to Englander to playing with the twins and then to the gambling scene. There's no clear transition or explanation for this shift.
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about Ramsey playing with the twins is disconnected from the rest of the narrative, with no clear connection to the gambling scene that follows.
- [LOGIC] The description of the Irwadian and the gambling scene seems to come out of nowhere, with no clear connection to the earlier conversation with Englander.
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from Ramsey feeling good about helping Englander to immediately being at the gambling hall with no explanation of how or why.
- [LOGIC] The description of the Irwadian and the gambling scene is detailed, but there's no clear reason for this description in the context of the overall narrative.
- [LOGIC] The paragraph about anthropologist friend's explanation of Irwadian clothing is somewhat tangential and doesn't seem to serve a clear purpose in the narrative.

Let me now assign scores based on these issues.

For fluency, there are several significant grammatical errors and one completely incoherent sentence. These issues would significantly impact readability. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the text is often difficult to read due to these issues, but not completely unreadable.

For coherence, there are several logical disconnections and abrupt shifts in the narrative. The text lacks smooth transitions between scenes and ideas. I would rate this as a 2.5 - the narrative is often difficult to follow due to these issues, but not completely incoherent.
