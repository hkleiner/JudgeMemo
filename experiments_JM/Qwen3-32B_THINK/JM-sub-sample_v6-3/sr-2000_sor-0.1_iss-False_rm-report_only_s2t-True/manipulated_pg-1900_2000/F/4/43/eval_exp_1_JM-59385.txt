Let me analyze the evaluation report and determine the final scores for coherence and fluency.

First, let's look at the fluency issues across both sections:

Section 1 (Chars 0-8380):
- Fluency score: 2.5
- Grammar issues: Awkward phrasing in a specific sentence
- Syntax issues: Run-on sentence structure and confusing word order/punctuation in a sentence about Wong Lui's pricing
- Spelling issues: One typo and a missing apostrophe

Section 2 (Chars 8381-11996):
- Fluency score: 2.5
- Syntax issues: Multiple very confusing sentences with jumbled word order
- Spelling issues: "hadas" appears to be a typo

For fluency, we see consistent problems in both sections with:
1. Significant syntax issues causing confusion
2. Spelling problems
3. Grammar issues in section 1

The scores for both sections are identical at 2.5, indicating serious fluency problems that make comprehension difficult in places.

Now for coherence:

Section 1:
- Coherence score: 3.5
- Logic issues: Abrupt shift to mission school memory with no clear connection
- Transition issues: Sudden jump from jewel-buying to graduation day memory
- Clarity issues: Unclear cultural context for dowry customs

Section 2:
- Coherence score: 2.5
- Logic issues: Incoherent sentence about France and perfume
- Structure issues: Abrupt jump from coherent narrative to incoherent section
- Clarity issues: Confusing transition between coherent and incoherent sections

For coherence, we see:
1. Section 1 has some issues but maintains a higher score (3.5)
2. Section 2 has much more severe coherence problems with a lower score (2.5)
3. Both sections show problems with logical flow, transitions, and clarity

Let me determine the final scores based on these observations:

For fluency:
- Both sections have serious issues that make comprehension difficult in places (2.5 score)
- The problems are consistent across both sections
- Given the consistent low scores, I would rate the overall fluency as 2.5

For coherence:
- Section 1 has noticeable but not severe issues (3.5 score)
- Section 2 has more severe problems (2.5 score)
- The second section shows significantly more disruption to the narrative flow
- Considering the range of issues and the scores for both sections, I would rate the overall coherence as 3.0

This reflects that while the first section maintains better coherence, the second section has more serious problems that would impact the overall reading experience.
