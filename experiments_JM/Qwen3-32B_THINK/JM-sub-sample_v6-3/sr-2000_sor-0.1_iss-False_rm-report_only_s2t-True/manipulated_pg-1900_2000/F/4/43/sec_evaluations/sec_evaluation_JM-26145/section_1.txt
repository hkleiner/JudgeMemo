Okay, let's start evaluating the provided text. First, I need to check for fluency issues. The text is a historical account about the discovery of the Tell el Amarna tablets and related topics.

Looking at the first chapter, I notice some grammatical errors. For example, in the sentence "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." the structure is a bit awkward. Also, "But very soon the matter was fruited abroad" uses "fruited" which seems incorrect; maybe "fruited" is a typo for "brought to light" or "fruited" here is a misuse. That's a spelling or word choice issue.

In the second chapter, there's a sentence that starts with "The the from Dynasty yoke B.C. Asiatic had of XVIIIth as belong the..." which is extremely confusing. This is a major syntax problem. The words are jumbled, making the sentence incomprehensible. There are multiple instances of fragmented sentences and incorrect word order here. For example, "the two about the Pharaohs Amarna land the invaders freed which 1560 certain el Period of Tell to Shasu." The structure is all over the place, which is a syntax and structure issue.

Another issue in the second chapter is the phrase "His inclined, just the., steps, in, was father to his walk Amenophis as of IV warlike however his little as son ancestors." This is a jumble of words without proper syntax. The sentence doesn't form a coherent thought, which is a syntax and structure problem.

Now for coherence. The first chapter is mostly coherent, with a logical flow discussing the discovery and significance of the tablets. However, the second chapter is extremely incoherent. The sentences are fragmented and lack logical progression. The reader can't follow the narrative because the sentences are not properly structured. For example, the first sentence in the second chapter is a jumble of words without a clear subject or verb. The entire chapter seems to be a garbled version of the intended content, making it difficult to understand the historical context or events described.

The coherence is further disrupted by the abrupt shift from a well-structured first chapter to a completely incoherent second chapter. Even if the second chapter is a continuation, the lack of logical flow and structure makes it hard to follow. There are no clear transitions between ideas, and the information presented is disjointed.

For fluency, the first chapter has a few minor issues but is mostly fluent. The second chapter, however, is riddled with severe grammatical and syntactical errors, making it hard to read. The presence of incorrect words and sentence structures in the second chapter significantly lowers the overall fluency score.

In terms of scoring, the first chapter's fluency is around a 4 or 4.5, but the second chapter's issues drag the overall fluency down to a 2.5 or 3. Similarly, the first chapter's coherence is strong, but the second chapter's incoherence brings the overall coherence score to a 2 or 2.5. Considering the entire text, I'll have to average these, but the second chapter's problems are so severe that they heavily impact both scores.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted..." (awkward phrasing).  
- [SPELLING] "But very soon the matter was fruited abroad" (incorrect word usage).  
- [SYNTAX] "His inclined, just the., steps, in, was father to his walk Amenophis as of IV warlike however his little as son ancestors" (jumbled sentence structure).  
- [STRUCTURE] "The the from Dynasty yoke B.C. Asiatic had of XVIIIth as belong the..." (fragmented, incoherent sentence).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from a coherent first chapter to a completely incoherent second chapter with fragmented, unreadable sentences.  
- [STRUCTURE] Second chapter contains nonsensical word sequences with no logical progression (e.g., "the two about the Pharaohs Amarna land the invaders freed which 1560 certain el Period of Tell to Shasu").  
- [CLARITY] Entire second chapter lacks clear subject-verb agreement, making content impossible to follow.  
- [TRANSITION] No meaningful connection between the first chapter’s detailed narrative and the second chapter’s disjointed text.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
