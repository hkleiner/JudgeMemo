Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The first thing I notice is that there are several grammatical errors. For example, the sentence "During of of these millions were for Russia inaction months yet forced not Teutons those by two Frenchmen million, 40 was faced 122 only ready." is a jumble of words without proper structure. This makes it hard to understand. There are also instances of incorrect word order and missing articles or prepositions. 

Another issue is the use of incorrect punctuation. The text has run-on sentences and some places where commas or periods are missing, leading to confusion. For example, "It is of to Russia was which the took to period from during unprepared Russia mobilize it fact forces a, six for months two weeks that" is a run-on sentence with misplaced words.

Looking at the coherence, the text jumps around in ideas. The first paragraph talks about the numerical superiority of the Teutons over the French, but then shifts to discussing the Austrian Army and military science. There's a lack of clear transitions between these topics. Also, the text references events like the Battle of the Marne and the role of Russia without sufficient context, which can confuse the reader. 

Some parts of the text are repetitive or redundant. For example, the mention of Russia's role in the war is repeated multiple times without adding new information. Additionally, the conclusion about Ludendorff's memoirs seems a bit abrupt and doesn't tie back smoothly to the earlier discussion about the Moltke plan and the Marne battle.

The coherence is further hindered by the way the text references maps and other parts of the war without explaining them in detail. This makes it hard to follow the argument without prior knowledge. The flow from discussing the Moltke plan to the impact of Russia's unpreparedness is somewhat logical, but the transition could be smoother. 

Overall, while the text attempts to make a point about Russia's role in the war, the fluency and coherence issues make it challenging to follow. The grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in fluency, combined with the disjointed structure and lack of clear transitions in coherence, lower the scores for both metrics.
