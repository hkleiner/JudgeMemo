Let me analyze the evaluation report and determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

For fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.0 with minor issues like punctuation errors and a confusing phrase.
- Section 02 has a score of 2.5 with more serious problems including incorrect word order, jumbled syntax, incoherent phrasing, and punctuation issues throughout complex sentences.

Overall, the text shows a significant decline in fluency from section to section. The first section has mostly minor issues while the second has more frequent and severe problems that affect readability.

For coherence:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.0 with some issues like a sudden shift in address and vague references.
- Section 02 has a score of 2.5 with serious problems including abrupt shifts in topic, lack of clear structure, disconnected ideas, and ineffective transitions.

The coherence also declines significantly from section to section, with the second section having frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make the overall coherence difficult to follow.

Based on these observations:
For fluency, I would give a score of 3.0. The text starts with mostly fluent sections but has a significant portion (section 02) with frequent grammatical errors and incoherent phrasing that affects readability.

For coherence, I would give a score of 2.5. The text has noticeable coherence issues in the first section but the second section has frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas that make the overall coherence difficult to follow, though it's not completely incoherent.

Let me finalize my scores:

1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
