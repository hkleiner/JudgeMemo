Let me analyze the evaluation report to determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

For fluency, I need to look at both sections:
- Section 01 has a fluency score of 3.0. Issues include jumbled sentence fragments, awkward phrasing, and some spelling concerns.
- Section 02 has a fluency score of 2.0. Issues include incorrect word order, run-on sentences, repetition, ambiguous terms, and punctuation problems.

Looking at the overall fluency issues across both sections:
- Both sections have significant syntax problems with jumbled or awkward phrasing
- Section 02 has more severe issues with grammar, repetition, and punctuation
- There are consistent problems with sentence structure and clarity
- The text appears to have frequent grammatical errors that affect readability

Based on the fluency scale:
- Score 2: Text contains frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or confusing structure. Some segments are clear, but comprehension is often difficult without effort.

This seems to fit the overall assessment as both sections have notable issues with fluency, with section 02 being particularly problematic. Given the severity of the issues in section 02 and the moderate issues in section 01, I would rate fluency as 2.5.

For coherence, I need to look at both sections:
- Section 01 has a coherence score of 3.0. Issues include abrupt transitions between chapters, confusing terminology, and jumbled sentences disrupting logical flow.
- Section 02 has a coherence score of 2.5. Issues include abrupt topic shifts, repetition without resolution, ambiguous references, and weak paragraph transitions.

Looking at the overall coherence issues across both sections:
- Both sections have problems with logical sequencing and transitions
- There are confusing terminology and inconsistent references
- The text appears to have frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas
- The overall coherence is difficult to follow in places

Based on the coherence scale:
- Score 2: The text has frequent inconsistencies, disconnected ideas, or illogical sequencing. Some parts may be understandable, but the overall coherence is difficult to follow without extra effort.

Given that section 02 is rated 2.5 for coherence and section 01 is 3.0, the overall coherence seems to be closer to the 2.5-3.0 range. I would rate coherence as 2.5, as the issues in section 02 are more severe and the problems in both sections together suggest a moderate to low coherence score.

My final assessment:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 2.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
