Alright, let's start by reading through the provided text carefully. The task is to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section, ignoring the previous context. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite dense and academic, so I'll look for any awkward phrasing or errors that might disrupt the flow.

Looking at the first paragraph: "consigning gods their generation parents the them pleasure takes from of a in special pedestals removing and, household to its the Each cupboard." This seems like a run-on sentence with jumbled words. The structure is confusing, making it hard to understand the intended meaning. That's a fluency issue under [SYNTAX].

Next, "The prophet or pioneer, after being at first declared to be unintelligible or absurd, has a brief spell of popularity, after which he is said to be conventional, and then antiquated." This sentence is okay, but maybe "has a brief spell" is a bit old-fashioned, though not necessarily incorrect. Not a major issue.

Moving to the part about the German Von Eicken: "The German Von Eicken found, in this tendency of all human movements to provoke violent reactions, the master key of history." The phrase "found, in this tendency..." is a bit awkward but still understandable. Maybe a comma splice or run-on sentence, so [SYNTAX] again.

In the paragraph about the Industrial Revolution: "The last century and a half, beginning with what Arnold Toynbee was the first to call the Industrial Revolution, has been a period of more rapid change than any other which history records." The structure is correct, but the use of "which" might be better as "that" for clarity. Not a major issue.

Looking at the sentence: "Then shook into Great a, followed social base slumbering of War its awakened, the and which structure vitality enthusiasm to intense the nationality." This is a jumbled sentence with incorrect word order. Definitely a [SYNTAX] issue.

Another example: "The often were still by fields the through are bad, tracks mere roads villages across that driven the they in preference were, common so as carts between Greece." The word order here is completely off, making it impossible to understand. [SYNTAX] and [GRAMMAR].

For coherence, the text is a historical analysis, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and transitions are smooth. The text starts by discussing the lifecycle of movements and then jumps to examples like Roman imperialism and the Catholic Church. The transition is abrupt but not entirely unclear. However, the shift from discussing the pendulum effect to the Industrial Revolution is a bit jarring. [STRUCTURE] or [TRANSITION].

The section about the English nation in the 18th century is well-structured but then the text mentions the decline in death rate and the impact of the Industrial Revolution. The connection between these points is logical, but the mention of the death rate and Factory Acts is a bit sudden. [LOGIC].

The last paragraph about the war's consequences is a bit confusing. The sentence structure is jumbled, which affects coherence. [STRUCTURE].

Overall, there are several syntax and grammar issues in the fluency category, and some abrupt transitions and logical jumps in coherence. The coherence is mostly there, but the fluency issues are more pronounced.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Jumbled sentence structure ("consigning gods their generation parents...") renders meaning unclear.  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing ("The prophet or pioneer... has a brief spell of popularity...") disrupts flow.  
- [SYNTAX] Run-on sentence with misplaced modifiers ("The German Von Eicken found, in this tendency...").  
- [SYNTAX] Incoherent word order ("Then shook into Great a, followed social base slumbering...").  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect word order and missing articles/determiners ("The often were still by fields...").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between historical examples (e.g., Roman imperialism to Jewish nationalism) lack clear transitions.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from discussing the Industrial Revolution to fragmented sentences about war and nationality disrupts narrative flow.  
- [TRANSITION] Unclear connection between the deathrate decline and the impact of the Industrial Revolution.  
- [CLARITY] Jumbled sentences in the final paragraph ("One result has of the not war...") create confusion about the argument.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
