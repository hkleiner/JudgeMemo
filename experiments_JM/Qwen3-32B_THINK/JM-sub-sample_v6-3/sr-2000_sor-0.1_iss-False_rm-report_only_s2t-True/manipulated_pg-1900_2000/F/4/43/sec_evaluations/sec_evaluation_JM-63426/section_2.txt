Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to rate the fluency and coherence of the given text. First, I need to go through the current section and look for any issues under each metric.

Starting with fluency. I'll scan each sentence for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice problems. The text is a narrative, so it should flow smoothly. Let me check for any errors.

Looking at the first part: "Teacher says, 'Take your books and go home, Willie, and remain until you have the correct answer.'" That seems okay. Next line: "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." Also fine. Then the dialogue with the mother. So far, no obvious issues.

Next paragraph: "You go to the office of the Iron Agitator, that later became Iron Ore. George A. Newett is the owner and editor. This A. newspaper Theodore by sued for were is the and later the libel George Newett that Roosevelt. The trial took place in Marquette, Michigan, and Mr. Roosevelt won a verdict of six cents." Wait, this sentence is a mess. The structure is all over the place. "This A. newspaper Theodore by sued for were is the and later the libel..." That's a jumble. Definitely a grammar and syntax issue here. Also, "sued for were is the and later the libel George Newett that Roosevelt." That's confusing. Maybe a misplaced modifier or incorrect word order.

Another part: "Having of beside to a are window can the as to lay noon-learn the the lower--going you half their where schoolchildren case wave an proudly they hour you home leisure of meal." This is incoherent. The words are there but the sentence structure is broken. Probably a syntax and grammar problem. It doesn't make sense as written.

Looking at "The two jobbers are kicked." That's a bit abrupt. Maybe a missing context, but as a standalone sentence, it's unclear. Is "kicked" the correct verb here? Maybe a word choice issue.

In the paragraph about the print shop: "The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It is printed one page at a time on a large Gordon. The owner and editor is John D. West. He offers you eight dollars a week." These sentences are okay. Then the next part: "You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to begin saving after paying board and buying your clothes." The dash here is okay, but maybe a comma would be better. Not a big issue.

Moving to the paragraph about moving to a new store-building: "In a few months Iron Ore moves into a new store-building. You are now thirteen and Mr. Newett offers you ten dollars a week and the acknowledged position of job printer. At fourteen this wage is increased to twelve. At man and ’s of fifteen week spoken as you in 85 are receiving a--a ’foreman wages aredollars fifteen." This part is confusing. "At man and ’s of fifteen week spoken as you in 85 are receiving a--a ’foreman wages aredollars fifteen." The sentence structure is all wrong here. The words are jumbled, making it hard to understand. Probably a grammar and syntax error.

Another part: "This is the early Eighties. Small towns such as Ishpeming are 'easy pickings' for traveling fakers. Their advance is always heralded by the exchanges. They clean up at the expense of local merchants. All editors warn them to keep away. Iron Ore print shop is on the ground floor." These sentences are okay. Then the description of Mr. Newett's actions: "Mr. where and leisurely rods there Newett fishing in several a guns walks to are corner." This is another jumbled sentence. The words don't form a coherent thought. Definitely a syntax issue.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative about a character's early life and work experiences. I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are transitions between paragraphs. The context provided is a continuation of the character's education and family life. The current section starts with the teacher's instruction, then moves to the mother's permission, working at the newspaper, and various job experiences. 

Looking for logical sequencing. The transition from school to working seems okay. However, some parts jump abruptly. For example, after the part about the trial involving Roosevelt, it jumps to the work at the press. That might be a transition issue. Also, the part about the faker selling soap comes in suddenly after discussing the job printer's wage. It might be a bit disjointed.

Another issue is the paragraph about the print shop being above a saloon and the heating with a stove. Then the next paragraph about the Peninsula Record and the job offer. The connection between these might be unclear. The flow between paragraphs isn't always smooth, leading to some confusion.

The final part about the faker and the trial with Roosevelt is a bit out of place. The narrative jumps to a different event without clear transition. This could be a coherence problem in terms of logical progression.

Also, some sentences are non-sequiturs. For example, the part about the schoolchildren waving and the meal. The connection between these elements isn't clear, making the paragraph confusing.

So, summarizing the issues: For fluency, there are several grammar and syntax errors, jumbled sentences, and awkward phrasing. For coherence, there are abrupt transitions, unclear connections between ideas, and some parts that don't logically follow the previous content.
