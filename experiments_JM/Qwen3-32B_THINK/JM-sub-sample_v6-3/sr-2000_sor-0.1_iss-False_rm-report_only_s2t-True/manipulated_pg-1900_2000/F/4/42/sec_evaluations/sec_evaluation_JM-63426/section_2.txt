Alright, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues in the given text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, and phrasing. 

First, I notice a few grammatical errors. For example, in the sentence "He is stood in a market wagon," "stood" is incorrect. The correct form should be "standing." That's a [GRAMMAR] issue. Another example is "Mr. Newett has write his last sheets of copy," where "write" should be "written" to match the past tense. That's another [GRAMMAR] error.

There's also a problem with punctuation. The sentence "In winter it is heated (?) with one stove." includes a question mark that doesn't serve a purpose here, which is a [PUNCTUATION] issue. The text also uses some awkward phrasing, like "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and 'borrow' packing boxes to get kindling for the stove and boiler." The word "devil" here is likely a typo or incorrect usage; it should be "devil" as in an assistant or helper, but the phrasing is confusing. This could be a [LEXICON] issue.

Now, moving on to Coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a narrative, so it should have a clear progression. 

The transition between the story about the narrator's job at the newspaper and the sudden mention of the faker selling soap is abrupt. There's no clear connection between the two events, which makes the flow disjointed. This is a [LOGIC] issue. Also, the mention of the "old army game" and the kerosene flare isn't explained, leaving the reader confused about the context. That's a [CLARITY] issue.

The text jumps from the narrator's work experiences to a sudden scene involving Mr. Newett and the faker without any transition. This abrupt shift disrupts the narrative flow and makes it hard to follow. This is a [STRUCTURE] issue. Additionally, some parts of the text reference events or terms that might be unclear without more context, like the "devil" in "your devil forage," which could be a term specific to the setting but isn't explained here. This contributes to [CLARITY] issues.

Considering the Fluency issues, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that affect readability but don't make the text impossible to understand. The errors are noticeable but not so frequent that they hinder comprehension. This would likely result in a score around 3 or 3.5. However, since the errors are a bit more than minor, I might lean towards 3.

For Coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions and lack of explanation for certain elements. The narrative flow is disrupted by the sudden shift to the faker scene, and some parts are unclear without additional context. This would likely result in a score of 3 or 3.5. Given the noticeable abrupt shifts and some confusion, a score of 3 seems appropriate.

So, my assessment would be:
- Fluency: 3 (due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing)
- Coherence: 3 (due to abrupt transitions and unclear elements)

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "He is stood in a market wagon" (should be "standing")
- [GRAMMAR] "Mr. Newett has write his last sheets of copy" (should be "written")
- [PUNCTUATION] Unnecessary question mark in "heated (?)"
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous reference to "devil" as a term
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "You and your devil forage in the snowdrifts..."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shift from print shop work to the soap-selling scene without transition
- [CLARITY] Unclear context for "old army game" and kerosene flare reference
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden jump from 15-year-old narrative to 1885 timeline without connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear relationship between print shop operations and the faker's actions

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
