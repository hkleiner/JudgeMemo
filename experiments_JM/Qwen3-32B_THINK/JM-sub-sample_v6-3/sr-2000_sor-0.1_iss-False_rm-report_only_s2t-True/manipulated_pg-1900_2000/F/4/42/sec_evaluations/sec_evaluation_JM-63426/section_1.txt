Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency issues. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The first thing I notice is a typo in the line "you caedn’t join the circus" – "caedn’t" is likely a typo for "couldn’t". That's a spelling issue. There's also a missing period after "Miss Parrot is the teacher--a dear!" which might be a punctuation problem. Another spot is "He gives you much fine advice which you never forgot." The verb tense here is inconsistent – "forgot" should be "forgotten" to match the present perfect. Also, in "You are the artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform," the use of "mamma" is a bit old-fashioned and might be considered a style choice rather than a fluency issue, but it's worth noting if it's a problem. 

Looking at the coherence issues, the text is a biography of Will Bradley, moving through his early life and career. The flow seems logical, but there are a few abrupt transitions. For example, the transition from the school scene in Lynn to the move to Swampscott is smooth, but the sudden shift to the father's illness and the move to Boston might be a bit jarring. Also, the mention of the "Narrow Gauge" to Boston without much explanation could confuse some readers. There's a jump from the family moving to Northern Michigan to the uncle bringing a watch instead of a printing press, which might need a smoother transition. The story is generally well-structured, but a few parts could be clearer.

For the fluency score, there are a couple of minor issues but nothing that severely hinders readability. The typo and tense issue are the main problems, so maybe a 4.5. For coherence, the narrative is mostly logical, but the transitions in a few places could be smoother, so a 4.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "caedn’t" (likely typo for "couldn’t")
