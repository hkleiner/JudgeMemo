Okay, let's take a look at the current section. The user wants me to evaluate it for fluency and coherence. First, I'll start with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation.

Looking at the first sentence: "Our underclothing coulded be drawn on only with difficulty..." The word "coulded" is incorrect. It should be "could be" or "could be drawn." So that's a spelling or grammar error. 

Next, "he modeled it after the mediaeval towns of his European home." "Mediaeval" is a British spelling; maybe it should be "medieval" in American English, but that's a style choice, not necessarily an error. 

Then, "when I purposely took this station that I mighted see..." "Mighted" is incorrect. The correct form is "might see." So another grammar issue.

Also, in the sentence about the American policemen: "a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki uniforms and russet leather leggins." "Leggins" is misspelled; it should be "leggings." 

In the part about the notice posted: "All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo should supply themselves with the following articles:" The colon here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit abrupt, ending with a colon and then a blank list. That might be intentional, but it's a bit of a structural issue in the text.

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a narrative describing the author's experience in Manila. The transition from the underclothing issue to the historical context of Manila seems a bit abrupt. The connection between the two isn't immediately clear. 

The mention of the old wall saving the city from Moros is a bit of a jump in the narrative. It might not be well-integrated with the rest of the description of the bridge and the city. 

The description of the bridge scene is detailed and flows well, but when it shifts to the river and the steamers, the transition is smooth. However, the final part about the notice posted is a sudden shift in tone and content, which might disrupt the coherence. 

The structure is generally logical, but the sudden mention of the underclothing issue at the beginning and then jumping to the historical context might confuse the reader. Also, the notice at the end is left hanging without resolution, which could be confusing if the reader is expecting more context.
