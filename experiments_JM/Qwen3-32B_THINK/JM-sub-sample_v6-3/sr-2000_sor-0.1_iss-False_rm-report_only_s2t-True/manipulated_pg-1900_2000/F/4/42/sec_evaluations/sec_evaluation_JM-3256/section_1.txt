Alright, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. The passage is quite old-fashioned in its language and style, which might make it less accessible to modern readers, but that's not necessarily a fluency issue. Let me scan for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or awkward phrasing.

First, I notice a few possible grammatical issues. For example, in the sentence "he may be a book huckster or his books may was those without which a gentleman’s library is not complete," the verb "was" doesn't agree with the subject "books." It should be "were." 

Then, there's a sentence that reads, "It is the foolishness of his kind to desire a loved author in some becoming dress, and his fastidiousness to ignore a friend in a fourpence-halfpenny edition." The word "his" here is ambiguous—does it refer to the bookman or the author? This could be a clarity issue.

Another spot is "I thought is apropos." The correct form should be "I thought was apropos." There's a missing "was" here.

In the sentence "he desired to create an atmosphere, and so he proposed with a certain imposing air that we should visit what he called 'my library'," the possessive "my" might be confusing. It's the host's library, so "his library" would be clearer.

Looking at the paragraph about Elia, the sentence structure is complex and convoluted, which might make it hard to follow. For example, "It has seemed to me as if certain old friends looked out from their prison with appealing glance, and one has been tempted to break the glass and let, for instance, Elia go free." The use of "one" here is vague, and the sentence is quite long, making it a bit of a readability issue.

There's also a sentence that says, "and in my wildest moments I had never asked the price of such a thing as that." The phrase "in my wildest moments" is a bit confusing in context—does it mean even in my most extravagant imaginings? It's a bit awkwardly phrased.

In the next paragraph, "He was so touched by this sign of grace that he spent a month of love over the commission," the phrase "a month of love" is a bit unclear. It might be better as "a month devoted to love" or something similar.

The sentence "but it is also proved, which is much more important, that he have the smack of letters in him" has a subject-verb agreement issue. It should be "he has."

Another example is "being turned loose without the guide of any training in this wide field, he fixed as by instinct on the two classics of the English tongue." The phrase "being turned loose" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

In the last paragraph, "When people are raving between the soup and fish about some popular novel which to-morrow will be forgotten," the phrase "between the soup and fish" is a metaphor for during a meal, which is okay, but the sentence is a bit long and complex.

Now, moving to coherence. The text is a narrative about bookmen and their relationship with books. The main idea is clear, but there are some transitions that could be smoother. For example, the shift from the anecdote about the host and his library to the colonial squatter's story is a bit abrupt. There's a mention of turning an anecdote upside down, but the connection isn't immediately clear.

The paragraph about the bushman and the books is a bit disjointed. The story is presented, but the transition from the previous anecdote is not smooth. The author mentions "It is said, and now I am going to turn the application of a pleasant anecdote upside down," which is a hint, but the connection isn't immediately obvious.

In the section discussing the difference between a bookowner and a bookman, the narrative jumps from the host's library to the bushman's story without a clear transition. The flow could be improved with a sentence or two to connect these ideas.

The mention of "Mark Rutherford" at the end is a bit out of place. The previous paragraphs discuss the distinction between popular and enduring literature, but the reference to Mark Rutherford isn't clearly tied to the preceding discussion. It feels a bit like an afterthought.

Overall, the text is coherent in that it presents a consistent theme about bookmen and their values, but there are some transitions and connections that could be smoother. The anecdotes are somewhat disjointed, and the flow between ideas isn't always seamless.
