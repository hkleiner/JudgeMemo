Alright, I need to evaluate the current section of the text based on fluency and coherence. Let me start with fluency. 

First, I'll read through the text carefully to spot any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with syntax. For example, in the line "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." the em dash usage is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and complex. However, it's still understandable, so maybe not a major issue.

Looking at another part: "We see before our eyes Welsh and Irish in process of being saved from extinction..." The phrase "in process of being saved" is a bit awkward. A smoother phrasing might be "in the process of being saved," but since I can't correct it, I just note it as a minor fluency issue.

In the sentence "But we need not go to earlier centuries or to distant countries for examples. In any Roman Catholic church in London to-day you will found the service conducted in a language which, if understand at all by the general body of the congregation, has been learn by them only for the purposes of the liturgy." There's a grammatical error here: "you will found" should be "you will find," and "if understand" should be "if understood," "has been learn" should be "has been learned." These are clear mistakes that affect fluency. Each of these is a [GRAMMAR] issue.

Another example: "Hebrew is one example among many of a language outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech." The phrasing "outliving for purposes of ritual" is a bit awkward. It might be better as "outliving its use in ordinary speech for ritual purposes." This is a [SYNTAX] issue.

Moving on to coherence. The text discusses the revival of Hebrew and other languages, then shifts to examples of ritual languages in different cultures. The transition is smooth, but in the part about the Roman Catholic church, the example is relevant but the connection could be clearer. However, the overall structure is logical and the ideas are connected. 

In the section about Germanism and the doctrine of election, the text links Jewish and German claims of chosenness. The transition from discussing Hebrew to Germanism is a bit abrupt but still follows a logical flow. There's a mention of a poem by Friedrich Lange, which is integrated well into the argument. 

However, there's a minor issue where the chronology is mentioned: "six thousand years ago the world by Hebrew reckoning had not been created, and at any rate the then Kings of Jerusalem were not Jewish." The reference to "six thousand years ago" might be confusing because the text earlier mentions the Hebrew calendar's creation date. This could be a [CLARITY] issue as it might not be clear to all readers why that date is relevant.

Also, in the line "The recent revelation of racial arrogance in Germany has provided our enemies with a new weapon. 'Germanism is Judaism,' says a writer in the American Bookman." The connection between German racial arrogance and the quote from the American Bookman is a bit abrupt. The transition could be smoother, perhaps a [TRANSITION] issue.

Putting this all together, for fluency, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the text is mostly readable. For coherence, the flow is generally logical, but there are a couple of points where transitions or clarity could be improved.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "you will found" (should be "find")  
- [GRAMMAR] "if understand" (should be "understood")  
- [GRAMMAR] "has been learn" (should be "learned")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech"  
- [SPELLING] "lived" (incorrect; should be "living" in "most distinguished of lived Jewish men")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [CLARITY] Confusing chronology reference: "six thousand years ago" (requires prior knowledge of Hebrew calendar to parse relevance)  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Hebrew revival to Germanism's "special election" without clear bridging  
- [LOGIC] Ambiguous connection between "Germanism is Judaism" quote and preceding context about racial arrogance  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
