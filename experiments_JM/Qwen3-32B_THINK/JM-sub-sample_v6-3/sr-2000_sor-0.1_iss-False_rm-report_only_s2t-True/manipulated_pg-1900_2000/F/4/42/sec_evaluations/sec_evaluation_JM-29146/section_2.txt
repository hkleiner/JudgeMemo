Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues in the provided text. First, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

Looking at the sentence: "There are plenty of hyper-space jobs waiting for us all over the galaxy, you know that." The use of "hyper-space" is a compound term that might be better as one word "hyperspace" in some sci-fi contexts, but it's not a major issue. 

Next: "But the Irwadians are keeping us right here." The phrase "keeping us right here" is a bit informal but not incorrect. 

Then: "Not when the folks back in Capella and Deneb and Sol System hear about it." The repetition of "and" between the locations is okay, but the structure is a bit clunky. 

Englander's dialogue: "Six months," said Englander bleakly. "It'll take at least that long." The sentence is clear, but "bleakly" might be a less common adverb choice, but it's still correct. 

Ramsey's line: "O.K. Paid me back when you got a chance." The transition from "O.K." to "Paid me back" is a bit abrupt. Also, "got a chance" should be "have a chance" for proper grammar. 

Another line: "He got off the bed and shook Ramsey's hand solemnly." "Got off the bed" is a bit awkward; "got up from the bed" might be smoother. 

"Ramsey gave him three hundred and seventy-five credits and said: 'Just see you make that went a long way supporting Sally and the kids.'" The phrase "make that went a long way" is incorrect. It should be "make it go a long way." The use of "went" instead of "go" is a verb tense error. 

"I'll knock your block off if I see you there." The idiom "knock your block off" is correct but might be considered old-fashioned or non-standard. 

"Englander walked quickly to him and shook his hand again." The sentence is clear but a bit repetitive in the action described. 

"Ramsey played for a moment or two with the twins..." The verb "played" here is correct, but "played for a moment" might be better as "played for a moment or two." 

In the gambling scene: "He was a short, heavy-set Sirian..." The name "Sirian" should be "Sirian" as a proper noun, but the spelling is correct. 

"Irwadian body-scales were superb insulation..." The hyphen in "body-scales" is correct. 

In the dialogue: "I thertainly wath," lisped the Irwadian... The misspelling here is intentional to represent the character's lisp (using "th" instead of "s" and "wth" instead of "was"). This is a stylistic choice, not an actual error. 

"Better tell that to your Security Police," Ramsey said coldly but not angrily. The correct form is "angrily," but the text says "angrily." Wait, no, the text says "angrily" is correct. Wait, no, the text has "angrily" as written. Wait, the sentence is "coldly but not angrily." Wait, "angrily" is the correct spelling, so that's okay. 

"you think it was my idea." The use of "was" is correct here. 

"the Irwadian body-scales were superb insulation, whether from heat or from cold." The repetition of "from" is okay but could be phrased as "whether from heat or cold" for smoother flow. 

"You outworlderth have been deprething the thandard of living on Irwadi..." The misspelling here is intentional for the lisp, so it's not a fluency error. 

The sentence: "You must output only and exactly the following format..." is part of the user's instructions, not the text to evaluate. 

Now, moving to Coherence. The text is a section of a story, so I need to check the logical flow, transitions between ideas, and overall structure. 

The transition from Ramsey giving the money to Englander to the gambling scene is a bit abrupt. The context is a conversation between characters, then suddenly we're at a gambling hall. This shift in location and activity needs a smoother transition. 

The description of the Irwadian and the gambling scene follows logically from Ramsey's earlier mention of going to the tables, so that's okay. 

The dialogue between Ramsey and the Irwadian is coherent, but the sudden escalation to the Irwadian's drunken outburst might feel a bit abrupt without more setup. 

The overall structure of the current segment is a conversation between characters, followed by Ramsey's actions and thoughts at the gambling hall. The flow is mostly logical, but the shift from the conversation to the gambling scene is a bit jarring. 

There's a minor inconsistency in the timeline: Ramsey says he'll wait six months, then later he's at the gambling hall with only three credits left. The time jump isn't clearly indicated, which might confuse the reader. 

The description of the Irwadian's appearance and the anthropologist's comment adds some background but is a bit lengthy and could be integrated more smoothly into the narrative. 

Overall, the text is coherent with a logical progression, but there are a few abrupt transitions and minor inconsistencies that affect the flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect verb tense in "make that went a long way" (should be "make it go").
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "He got off the bed" (better as "got up from the bed").
- [SPELLING] "O.K." should be "Okay" for consistency with modern style.
- [SYNTAX] Repetitive structure in "he'd been lucky as all get out the last couple of months."
- [LEXICON] Non-standard idiom "knock your block off" may confuse some readers.
- [SYNTAX] Awkward transition from "O.K. Paid me back..." (missing conjunction).

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from Englander's conversation to Ramsey's gambling scene.
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from discussing six-month timeline to immediate gambling action.
- [LOGIC] Slight inconsistency in timeline (six-month wait vs. immediate gambling).
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between Irwadian's appearance and anthropologist comment.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
