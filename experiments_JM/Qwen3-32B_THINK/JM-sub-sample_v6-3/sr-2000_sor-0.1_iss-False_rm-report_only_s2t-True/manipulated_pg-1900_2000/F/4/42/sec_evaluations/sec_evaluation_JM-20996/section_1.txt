Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, looking at **Fluency**. The text is a historical narrative with some complex sentences. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice issues.

- The phrase "We am alone" in the first chapter is a clear grammar error. "We" should be "we are" or "we were." That's a [GRAMMAR] issue.
- "The wind which always blows in tropical countries is gathered..." might have a syntax problem. The sentence structure is a bit awkward, maybe due to the placement of "which." [SYNTAX]
- In the part about the Bishop Museum, "was plucked" should be "were plucked" since "feathers" is plural. [GRAMMAR]
- "The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this royal robe." The word "making" might be better as "creation" for clarity, but it's more a style choice than a grammar issue. Maybe [LEXICON] if it's about word choice.
- "So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were employed a score or more of years..." The phrase "a score or more of years" is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. Not a major issue.
- "Placing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure..." The verb "placing" here is a bit awkward. Maybe [SYNTAX].
- "The native wades far out into the surf with a long narrow board..." The use of "wades" is correct, but "narrow" might be better as "narrow, long" for clarity. [LEXICON].
- "The birds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian Islands..." "They" refers to feathers, so maybe "feathers" instead of "they" for clarity. [PRONOUN AGREEMENT].
- "The time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season..." The phrase "in the midst of the rainy season" is correct, but "was in the midst of" could be more concise. [STYLE], though not a grammar error.

Now, for **Coherence**. The text is a chapter in a book, so transitions between sections should be smooth. 

- The transition from the preface to Chapter I is abrupt. The preface is a letter from the author, then it jumps to discussing a specific historical event. [STRUCTURE]
- In Chapter I, the narrative shifts from the ship's departure to the Hawaiian Islands and then to the Bishop Museum. These shifts are smooth, but the connection between the voyage and the museum might not be clear. [LOGIC]
- The mention of "Century Magazine for September, 1889." in the middle of the narrative is a bit jarring. It might be a reference but disrupts the flow. [STRUCTURE]
- The description of the women's clothing in Chapter II is detailed but might be better organized. The sentence about the skirt is a bit long and could be split for clarity. [STRUCTURE]
- The part about the rainy season affecting clothing is a clear example of the setting but connects well to the narrative. [LOGIC]

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with some minor issues in transitions and structure. The fluency has a few grammatical errors but is mostly readable.
