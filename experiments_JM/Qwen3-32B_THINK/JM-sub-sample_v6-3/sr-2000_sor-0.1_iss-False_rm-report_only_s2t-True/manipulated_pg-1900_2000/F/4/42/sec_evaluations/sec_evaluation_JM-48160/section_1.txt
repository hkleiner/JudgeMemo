Okay, let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section. The previous section is just the chapter title and date, so I can ignore that.

First, for fluency. I need to look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. Let me go through the text sentence by sentence. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "France to-day is sharply divided..." The hyphen in "to-day" is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. The sentence structure seems okay. Then, "All that is necessary is a sauf conduit..." "Sauf conduit" is a French term, maybe should be italicized or explained, but that's more about clarity than fluency. 

Next, "But the other, the Zone des Armées, in common parlance the war or military zone! There is only one thing in France more difficult of contact..." The exclamation mark might be a bit strong, but not a fluency issue. "More difficult of contact" – maybe "more difficult to contact" is better. 

Moving on: "For nearly three months now I have felt like an inverted snob..." The sentence is a bit long but still readable. 

Then, "If you bring even one letter to society, either in France or any European capital, all doors was open to you..." The verb agreement is off here. "Doors was" should be "were". That's a grammar issue. 

Another part: "He told me in the friendliest manner that when I obtained permission to go to the front he would provide me with the necessary letters, but that as I is an American..." "I is" should be "I am". Grammar error. 

In the next paragraph: "I try one or two members..." "Try" should be "tried" for past tense. Spelling mistake. 

"Royalty itself would not was considered." "Was" should be "be". Grammar error. 

"I feel I should saw things..." "Saw" should be "see". Verb tense error. 

"He coulded went to Rouen..." "Coulded went" is incorrect. Should be "could go". Grammar error. 

Moving to coherence. The text is about the author's attempts to enter the war zone. The flow seems logical: introduction of the problem, attempts to get permission, interactions with various people, and the outcome. However, there might be some abrupt transitions. 

For example, after discussing the British in Rouen, the author suddenly shifts to stating her desire to go to Amiens. Is there a clear connection? Maybe not entirely smooth. Also, when listing the cities to visit, the transition to adding her own preferences could be clearer. 

Another point: the mention of "taubes" shelling Bar-le-Duc. The term "taubes" is a French term for German aircraft, but if the audience is general, it might be unclear. However, since it's a historical text, maybe the context allows it. 

The description of the cemeteries is vivid, but the shift from the bureaucratic process to the battlefield description is a bit abrupt. However, given the narrative, it's part of the story's progression. 

Overall, the coherence is mostly there, but there are some minor transitions that could be smoother. 

Now, compiling the issues for each category. For fluency, the main issues are verb agreement, tense errors, and a few spelling mistakes. For coherence, some transitions could be smoother, but the overall structure is logical. 

Scoring: Fluency. The errors are several but not too frequent. They are noticeable but don't disrupt overall readability. So maybe a 4. Coherence: some minor issues but the narrative is clear. So a 4.5.
