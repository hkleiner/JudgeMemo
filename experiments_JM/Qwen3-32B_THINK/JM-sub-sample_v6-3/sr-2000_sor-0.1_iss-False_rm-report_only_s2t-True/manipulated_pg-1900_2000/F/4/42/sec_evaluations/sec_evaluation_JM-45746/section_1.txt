Okay, let me start by reading through the current section to evaluate. The text is about someone's journey into teaching and their observations on different school environments. 

First, for Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. Let me go through the text again. 

In the first paragraph, "I must not accept just a mere job" – the use of "must not" here is a bit odd. Maybe it's a tense issue. Also, "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession" – "manner" might be better as "way". 

Looking at the part with the janitor: "He said he didn't know just which way the desks should faced" – "faced" should be "face" since it's the base form after "should". 

Then, "the board had not decided on the kind of benches or tools to bought" – "bought" should be "buy". 

In the next example, "On this particular trip, I was force to stop over" – "force" should be "forced". 

Also, "I was now really interested in education and thought it would be well to visit the school building. The first thing to attract my attention was the well-kept lawn..." – "to attract" is correct, but maybe a smoother transition could be better. 

Moving on, "He enthusiastically told me that he was interested in the agricultural conditions..." – "interested in the agricultural conditions" might be better as "in agricultural conditions". 

In the fifth grade room example: "I notice in this bulletin that the correct distance..." – "notice" should be "noticed" for past tense. 

Then, "since then I have give much time..." – "give" should be "given". 

There are several instances of subject-verb agreement issues, like "The situation that confronted me... can be illustrated by the experiences of two young men who enter..." – "enter" should be "entered". 

Also, "I was force to stop over" – "force" is incorrect, should be "forced". 

For Coherence, the text tells two stories: one about a poorly managed school and another about a proactive young teacher. The transition between these two stories is a bit abrupt. The first part ends with the superintendent being negligent, and then shifts to a different example where a young man improves the school. The connection between these two examples isn't clearly explained, which might confuse readers. 

Additionally, the narrative jumps between different time periods and locations without clear transitions. For example, the author moves from a visit to a neighboring state to a summer trip in another state without a smooth connection. 

The ending of the first chapter leads into the next chapter, "GETTING A POSITION", but the transition is abrupt. The reader might not see how the two chapters are related. 

There are also some unclear references. For instance, "Mr. ----" in the first example is left unnamed, which might be intentional, but it could confuse readers if the context isn't clear. 

The structure of the text is mostly logical, but the abrupt shifts between the two examples and the lack of transitional phrases make the flow a bit choppy. 

So, for Fluency, there are several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasings. For Coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions between the two examples and the lack of clear connections between different parts of the text.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "desks should faced" (incorrect verb form; should be "face")
- [GRAMMAR] "tools to bought" (incorrect infinitive; should be "buy")
- [GRAMMAR] "I was force to stop over" (incorrect past tense; should be "forced")
- [GRAMMAR] "I was now really interested... The first thing to attract my attention was..." (awkward transition between sentences)
- [GRAMMAR] "He was elected here a year ago" (ambiguous reference to "he")
- [GRAMMAR] "I notice in this bulletin" (tense error; should be "noticed")
- [GRAMMAR] "have give much time" (tense error; should be "given")
- [SYNTAX] "It certainly was not a very creditable manner for a young man to enter a profession" (awkward phrasing; "manner" is less natural than "way")
- [SPELLING] "shoulded be cultivated" (incorrect past participle; should be "should be cultivated")

2) Coherence Issues:
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift between the two contrasting school examples without clear connection
- [LOGIC] Sudden jump from describing one superintendent's neglect to a completely different young teacher's proactive approach without transitional context
- [STRUCTURE] Unclear relationship between the two main examples and their relevance to the overall theme
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "Mr. ----" without sufficient context
- [TRANSITION] Sudden transition from the second teacher's story to the chapter heading "GETTING A POSITION" without clear narrative connection

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
