Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

**FLUENCY ISSUES:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "had been upstairs to changed something" - The verb tense is inconsistent. It should be "to change" or "to have changed."

2. [SPELLING] "Itsed a charming article" - "Itsed" appears to be a typo. It should be "It's a" or "It was a."

3. [GRAMMAR] "I was happy to be able to did the same" - The verb form is incorrect. It should be "do" rather than "did."

4. [SPELLING] "you’red so deep" - "you’red" appears to be a typo. It should be "you're so deep."

5. [PUNCTUATION] "He’d take it upstairs with him and looked at it on going to dress." - The sentence is missing a comma after "He'd."

**COHERENCE ISSUES:**

1. [LOGIC] "There am people from outside as well" - This sentence is confusing. It should be "There are people from outside as well."

2. [STRUCTURE] The narrative jumps between different perspectives and locations without clear transitions, making it slightly disorienting.

3. [CLARITY] The text references "The Middle" and "The review" without providing enough context for a reader who hasn't seen the previous section.

4. [TRANSITION] The transition from the dinner scene to the conversation between Vereker and Miss Poyle is abrupt.

Now, let me assign scores:

For fluency, the text has several grammatical and spelling errors that affect readability. The errors are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand overall, but they do create distractions. I would rate this a 3.5 - the text is generally readable but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow.

For coherence, the narrative follows a logical progression and connects ideas smoothly for the most part. There are a few confusing moments and abrupt transitions, but these don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding. I would rate this a 4 - the text is mostly coherent with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts.

Let me double-check my analysis:

Fluency: 3.5
- The text is generally readable but contains several grammatical and spelling errors that interrupt the flow.
- The errors are not so severe as to make the text difficult to understand overall.

Coherence: 4
- The narrative follows a logical progression and connects ideas smoothly for the most part.
- There are a few confusing moments and abrupt transitions, but these don't significantly disrupt the overall understanding.

I'll now format my response according to the required structure.
