Alright, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to look at the Fluency and Coherence of the provided text. 

Starting with Fluency. The user mentioned to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me read through the text again.

The sentence "It was young Rosa Bonheur serving her apprenticeship to art." seems a bit awkward. Maybe a comma after "art." would help, but it's a minor issue. 

Next, "had christen her 'the little hussard.'" The verb should be "christened" instead of "christen" because it's past tense. That's a spelling/grammar error. 

Then, "only drive her to still more obstinate and persistent study." The verb "drive" should be "drove" to match the past tense context. So that's another grammar error. 

Looking for other issues: "Her father's mania for changing his residence dragged her successively to..." The word "successively" might be better as "successively" but it's correct. Maybe "subsequently" would be clearer, but it's not a major issue. 

There's a run-on sentence in "Later on, when she in her turn became a teacher, Rosa Bonheur was able to proclaim the necessity of line-work with all the more authority because it had always been the fundamental basis, the very scaffolding of all her works." It's a bit long but not a major fluency problem. 

I notice some repetition in "the very scaffolding of all her works." Maybe "her works" is redundant, but it's not a critical issue. 

Moving to Coherence. The text is a narrative about Rosa Bonheur's early life and career. The flow seems logical. Each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next topic. 

However, in the sentence "The latter were soon forced to admire the intense relief of her method of painting, living animals transcribed in full action, and their different physiognomies rendered with admirable fidelity and art." The phrase "the latter" refers back to "the critics," which is clear, but the structure is a bit complex. It might be slightly confusing but not a major issue. 

Another point is the mention of "the Rue Rumford was practically in the open country" followed by a list of farms. The transition is smooth, so that's okay. 

The text references "Ingres" without context, but since it's a biography, that's acceptable. 

Overall, the coherence is strong. The ideas are logically sequenced, and the narrative progresses well. 

So for Fluency, there are a couple of grammar issues and a minor word choice. For Coherence, it's mostly good with a few minor transitions. 

Fluency score: 4.5? Because there are a couple of errors but overall the text is mostly fluent. 

Coherence score: 5, since the structure and flow are good without major issues.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "had christen" should be "had christened"
- [GRAMMAR] "only drive" should be "only drove"
- [SPELLING] "dolman with military frogs" is correctly spelled but unusual phrasing
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentence structure in the Ingres reference paragraph

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Slight abrupt transition between paragraphs about her studio habits and the 1841 Salon acceptance
- [CLARITY] Sudden shift from anatomical studies to menagerie in her apartment
- [TRANSITION] "The latter were soon forced to admire..." refers back to "critics" but connection could be clearer

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
