Alright, let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. [GRAMMAR] "enough coulded be seen of the great design" - This has a grammatical error with "coulded" which should be "could be seen".

2. [GRAMMAR] "Here am find, sculptured and inscribed in a new and peculiar style" - This has a grammatical error with "am find" which should be "are found".

3. [GRAMMAR] "But very soon the matter was fruited abroad" - "Fruited" is incorrect; it should be "fruition" or "became known".

4. [GRAMMAR] "in the times of the two kings Amenophis III. and IV." - The period after "III" should not be a period, but a comma or space.

5. [SPELLING] "The dusky fellows must have been not a little delighted" - "Dusky" is an unusual term for local workers and might be a misinterpretation.

6. [GRAMMAR] "The scribe of the Hittite king produced only a species of dog Latin" - "Species of dog Latin" is an awkward phrasing.

7. [GRAMMAR] "The letters of the king of Mitani was drawn up" - Subject-verb agreement issue; "was" should be "were".

8. [GRAMMAR] "He reigned thirty-six years, long enough to allow the movement introduced by him to run its course" - This sentence is awkwardly constructed.

9. [GRAMMAR] "Hamper apparently by bodily defects" - "Hamper" is missing a preposition; it should be "Hampers apparently" or "Apparently hampered".

**Coherence Issues:**

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different topics without clear transitions, such as from the discovery of tablets to the discussion of the Egyptian court.

2. [LOGIC] The text references "Pharaoh" as a title not used in the Tell el Amarna documents, but doesn't clearly explain the significance of this observation.

3. [CLARITY] The explanation of the cuneiform script and its use by scribes is complex and could benefit from clearer organization.

4. [TRANSITION] The transition from Chapter I to Chapter II is abrupt, with no clear connection or summary of the previous chapter's content.

5. [LOGIC] The text mentions "dog Latin" and "dog Greek" as analogies but doesn't fully explain these references in the context of the ancient Near East.

6. [STRUCTURE] The discussion of the scribes' proficiency is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, jumping between different scribes and their abilities.

7. [CLARITY] The explanation of the Mitani scribe and the origin of the Assyrian cuneiform is complex and could be clearer.

8. [LOGIC] The text states that the Mitani scribe had no special difficulty, but this contradicts the earlier explanation of difficulties with the script.

9. [LOGIC] The text references "preciosity" as equivalent to "wisdom" without fully explaining this interpretation.

10. [STRUCTURE] The final paragraph about Amenophis III and IV is somewhat disconnected from the earlier discussion of the tablets.

Now, I'll assign scores based on these observations:

**Fluency Score:** There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the text is still generally readable. The errors don't completely disrupt comprehension, but they are noticeable. I would rate this as a 3.5 out of 5.

**Coherence Score:** The text has some structural issues and awkward transitions, but the main ideas are generally clear. The jumps between topics are sometimes abrupt, but the overall narrative is still understandable. I would rate this as a 3.5 out of 5.

I'll now format my response according to the required format.
