Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, looking at fluency. The text is a chapter from a story, and I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

I notice a few issues. For example, "The schools was sad and slow" – "schools" is plural, so it should be "were". That's a grammar error. Then there's "The man in the doorway smiled as over the misdemeanour of somebody very dear and lovable" – the phrase "as over" seems incorrect; maybe "at the" was intended. That's a syntax problem. 

Another part is "He had satisfy himself for the moment" – the past participle should be "satisfied". That's a grammar mistake. Also, "He had am exactly like that of all the other boys in Edgewood" – "am" is incorrect here; should be "been". Grammar again. 

There's "he woulded yield him its secret sense" – "woulded" is a typo; should be "would". Spelling error. And "when a fly buzz on the window-pane" – missing "ed" in "buzzed". Spelling mistake. 

Then "he was always stood on the toes" – incorrect tense; should be "standing". Grammar. 

Now, for coherence. The story is about a boy reading to his uncle, who is blind. The narrative flows well, but I need to check for logical sequence and transitions. 

The transition from the boy reading to the uncle's actions is smooth. The uncle's description of the violin and his backstory are connected. However, when the text shifts to Anthony's childhood, it's a bit abrupt. The paragraph about the school and his behavior there is a bit long and could be clearer. Also, the mention of the "jew’s-harp" and other items in his pockets might be confusing if the reader isn't paying close attention. 

There's a part where it says "the contents, when confiscated, would comprise..." which is a bit complex but still understandable. The story does maintain a consistent narrative, so coherence is mostly good, but some sections could be smoother. 

Putting it all together, fluency has several issues but not too many to make it hard to read. Coherence is mostly there, but a few parts are a bit jarring. Scoring fluency as 3.5 because of multiple grammar and spelling errors that affect readability. Coherence might be 4 because the overall structure is logical, but some transitions and clarity issues are present.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "The schools was sad and slow" (subject-verb agreement error)
- [SYNTAX] "The man in the doorway smiled as over the misdemeanour" (awkward preposition usage)
- [GRAMMAR] "He had satisfy himself for the moment" (verb tense error)
- [GRAMMAR] "He had am exactly like that of all the other boys" (verb form error)
- [SPELLING] "he woulded yield him its secret sense" (incorrect past tense)
- [SPELLING] "when a fly buzz on the window-pane" (missing past tense)
- [GRAMMAR] "he was always stood on the toes" (tense inconsistency)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from the uncle's violin description to Anthony's backstory without clear transition
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between the boy's current reading and Anthony's childhood experiences
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "the school" vs. "the singing-school" in different contexts
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from the violin playing scene to Anthony's childhood school experiences
- [LOGIC] Slightly inconsistent timeline in describing Anthony's development from schoolboy to blind violinist

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
