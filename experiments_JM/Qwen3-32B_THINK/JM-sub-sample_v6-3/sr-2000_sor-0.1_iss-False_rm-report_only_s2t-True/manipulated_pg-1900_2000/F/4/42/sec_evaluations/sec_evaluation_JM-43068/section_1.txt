Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the given section about Millet. First, I need to go through each part carefully.

Starting with fluency. I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. Let me read through the text again. 

Hmm, there's a typo in "betwixted" â€“ it should be "betwixt". Also, "unbroken by a single name" might be a bit awkward. The phrase "has come to occupy his proper position" is correct, but maybe "has come to occupy his proper position" is a bit wordy. 

Looking further, "Formerly he is looked upon" should be "was looked upon" for correct tense. Then "have reveal" is incorrect; it should be "have revealed". There's a missing apostrophe in "Dutchmen's brutality". 

In the sentence "Millet can was considered", the correct form is "Millet was considered". "Coulded one to-day encounter" has an extra 'd' at the end. "Unremited toil" should be "unrelenting toil". 

There are some awkward phrases like "the same profound and sympathetic rendering... is to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament." The word "tinged" might not be the best choice here. 

Now for coherence. The text discusses Millet's influence and compares him to other artists. The flow seems logical, but there are a few abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from discussing Brueghel to the French Revolution and then to Millet's style. 

The paragraph about "Angelus" and the discussion on religion and peasant life is coherent, but the connection between the religious beliefs of peasants and the critique of sentimentality might be a bit abrupt. 

The final paragraph about Millet's technique and his position in art is clear, but the transition from discussing his restrained style to the conclusion might be a bit sudden. 

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are a few places where the flow could be smoother. The fluency has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that would distract a reader. 

For fluency score, considering the number of errors and their impact on readability, I'd say it's a 3.5. For coherence, the structure is mostly logical with some minor issues, so a 4.5.
