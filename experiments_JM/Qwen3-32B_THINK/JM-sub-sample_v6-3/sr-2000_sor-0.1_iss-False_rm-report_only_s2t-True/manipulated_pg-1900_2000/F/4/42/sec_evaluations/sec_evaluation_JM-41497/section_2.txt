Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency of the text. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

First sentence: "There was no period of weary waiting." That seems fine. Next part: "Thanks to the quality of his work and the patronage granted so freely, he began at once to enjoy the success that belonged to the popular portrait painter." The grammar here is correct, but maybe "belonged to" is a bit awkward. Wait, maybe not. 

Then: "A little later he moved to Great Newport Street, where the accommodation was better suited to the growing claims of sitters, and in 1760 he went to 47 Leicester Square, now an auction-house, where he live for the remainder of his life." The verb tense here is off. "He live" should be "he lived." That's a grammar error. 

Next part: "As he moved he raised his prices, but nobody seemed to mind. Everybody who was anybody, paid cheerfully. So did some of the other people." The comma after "anybody" is unnecessary; it should be a semicolon or the sentence should be split. Also, "So did some of the other people" is a bit awkward phrasing. 

Moving on: "Many artists remain painters all their lives. Meet them in a studio or at a private view and they are illuminating; talk about another lying outside their immediate interests and they are dumb, or worse, for some talk without saying anything, as though they were mere politicians." The sentence structure here is a bit confusing. The use of "Meet them..." as a command is a bit jarring. Also, "another lying outside their immediate interests" might be better as "another subject lying outside..." 

Another part: "Perhaps we have no right to complain of this lack of mental dimensions, but it is permissible to note with pleasure the few cases in which an artist reveals himself as an accomplished man of the world." The phrase "mental dimensions" is a bit unclear. Maybe "mental depth" would be better. 

Then: "Reynolds would never have been content to be nothing more than a painter, and he chose his friends so wisely that the living served him as well as the dead." "The living served him as well as the dead" is a bit confusing. Maybe "the living served him as well as the dead did" to clarify. 

Next: "If the great artists of Italy had shed light upon his path in one direction, what did he not owe to the men of his own generation, whose society must have am a source of inspiration to any intelligent man?" The phrase "must have am a source" is incorrect. It should be "must have been a source." That's a grammar error. 

Continuing: "Dr. Johnson himself could only have been inspiring company, even though we may think in our heart of hearts that the benefit of the inspiration was not without serious drawbacks." The phrase "in our heart of hearts" is correct, but maybe a bit informal. 

"Reynolds enjoyed also the intimate friendship of Garrick, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Burke, he consorted with many other men who made some mark in the world of thought..." The comma before "he consorted" is a comma splice. It should be a semicolon or split into two sentences. 

"and in this atmosphere the extraordinary receptivity of his mind must have served him to great advantage." "Served him to great advantage" is correct, but maybe "served him to great advantage" is a bit awkward. 

"He had human weaknesses to live down, and it is to his credit that he conquered all or most of them." "Live down" is correct, but maybe "overcome" would be clearer. 

"Like so many honest Englishmen, there was a touch of the snob about him--witness his correspondence with Lord Edgcumbe during the first visit to the Continent." The em dash is used correctly here. 

"He was not without jealousy, as may be seen from his pettish condemnation of the work of Liotard, the miniature painter and pastellist, and his references to Gainsborough and Romney, whose success and accomplishments galled him not a little." "Pettish" might be a bit archaic, but it's correct. 

"He was vulgar, until he learned refinement from the distinguished people with whom he was brought into contact--witness the gilded coach and gaudy liveries he bought when he establish himself in Leicester Square..." The verb tense is off here. "He establish" should be "he established." 

"the coach in which his unfortunate sister Frances was compelled to drive in order that the man in the street might stare open-mouthed and talk about her brother." The structure here is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct. 

"There is hardly a "Lion Comique," or a lady of the music halls drawing prime minister's salary for songs blatant or obscene, who would commit such an offence to-day..." The phrase "prime minister's salary" should be "a prime minister's salary." Also, "to-day" is spelled with a hyphen, which is correct but less common in modern usage. 

"and against these lapses from taste Sir Joshua's acquaintance with the best minds of his day failed to save him." The structure here is okay. 

"Perhaps the atmosphere of Leicester Square in the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century was a little theatrical." The placement of the comma is incorrect. It should be "the eighteenth, as in the twentieth, century" with commas around the "as in the twentieth" part. 

"Of course the faults of a man and the merits of his work are distinct and stand apart from one another, but we are too apt to look at Reynolds the man in the light of Goldsmith's epitaph, and it is the failing of popular biography to supply popular people with a measure of moral equipment that would make a saint self-conscious." The sentence is long but grammatically correct. 

"It is far more interesting to see great men as they live." This is a fragment but used for effect. 

Now, moving to Coherence. The text is a biographical piece discussing Reynolds' career, his personality, and the context of his time. The flow seems logical, moving from his career progression to his personality traits and the societal context. However, there are some transitions that might be abrupt. 

The shift from discussing his career to artists in general ("Many artists remain painters all their lives") might be a bit jarring. The connection isn't immediately clear, but the text then returns to Reynolds, so it's a minor issue. 

The paragraph about his weaknesses and friends is connected to the previous discussion, but the transition could be smoother. 

The part about the gilded coach and his sister's experience is a specific example, but the connection to his character might not be immediately obvious to all readers. 

The final paragraphs discuss the atmosphere of Leicester Square and the critique of biographies, which ties back to Reynolds' legacy but the connection could be clearer. 

Overall, the text is coherent with a logical progression, but there are a few places where transitions could be smoother. The ideas are connected, but some shifts might require the reader to make more effort to follow the argument.
