Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the current section carefully.

**Fluency Issues:**
- [GRAMMAR] The first sentence has a missing apostrophe in "was enthroned" (should be "shall be enthroned").
- [SYNTAX] The phrase "slew surrendered Moabites in cold blood" is awkward; "slew surrendered" is not the correct usage. It should be "slew the surrendered Moabites."
- [GRAMMAR] "Nor are such ideas discarded by the synagogue of to-day." The phrase "to-day" is archaic and should be "today." Also, the sentence structure is a bit awkward.
- [SPELLING] "Judas Maccabæus" has a non-standard character (æ), which might be a typo or formatting issue.
- [SYNTAX] "Every Saturday night the orthodox Jew repeated the prayer..." The verb "repeated" is in past tense, but the context suggests a habitual action, so "repeats" would be more appropriate.
- [GRAMMAR] "And at the Passover Seder Service he still repeats..." The phrase "he still repeats" refers to the Jew, which is correct, but the structure is a bit awkward.
- [SPELLING] "Messianic" is spelled correctly, but "mediæval" uses an archaic "æ" which might be a typo.
- [SYNTAX] "Let us ignore--as completely as Jesus did--that the legal penalty..." The em dashes are used correctly, but the sentence is complex and a bit hard to follow.
- [GRAMMAR] "Is not that very maxim to-day the clamoured policy..." The use of "to-day" again is archaic, and "clamoured" is British spelling; the text is otherwise in American English, so "clamored" might be more consistent.
- [GRAMMAR] "When this is the imprecation of a Vehaeren or a Maeterlinck..." The name "Vehaeren" might be misspelled or a typo.
- [GRAMMAR] "Nay, only the other Sunday an Englishwoman in a country drawing-room..." The word "Nay" is archaic and might not fit the modern context.
- [GRAMMAR] "You must output only and exactly the following format..." This line seems out of place and might be a formatting instruction left in the text by mistake.

**Coherence Issues:**
- [LOGIC] The transition from the previous section to the current one is abrupt. The previous section discusses historical examples of religious violence, while the current section starts with David and Judas Maccabaeus, which is a logical continuation but could benefit from a smoother transition.
- [STRUCTURE] The section jumps between different historical and religious references (David, Judas Maccabaeus, Isaiah, Passover Seder, etc.) without clear connections, making it difficult to follow the main argument.
- [CLARITY] The sentence "Let us ignore--as completely as Jesus did--that the legal penalty of 'eye for eye' had been commuted into a money penalty..." is complex and could be clearer. The comparison to Jesus is somewhat confusing.
- [LOGIC] The shift from discussing biblical passages to modern examples (Vehaeren, Maeterlinck, the Englishwoman) is jarring and lacks a clear logical progression.
- [CLARITY] The reference to "Maimonided but made confusion worse confounded when by allegations of allegory" is unclear and might be a typo or grammatical error. It should likely be "Maimonides made confusion worse confounded when he used allegations of allegory."
- [STRUCTURE] The section ends abruptly with "You must output only and exactly the following format..." which seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the argument.

**Final Scores:**
- Fluency: The text has several grammatical, spelling, and syntactic issues that affect readability but do not make the text completely unintelligible. The use of archaic terms and inconsistent spelling also contributes to the problems. I would rate this as a 3.5.
- Coherence: The text jumps between different historical and religious references without clear connections, making it difficult to follow the argument. The logical progression is sometimes unclear, and there are abrupt shifts. I would rate this as a 3.
