Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the given text. I need to look for any grammar, spelling, syntax, or word choice issues that might affect readability. 

First, I notice some archaic language like "’Tis a lie!" and "Lass," which is intentional for historical context, so that's probably okay. However, there are some spelling errors. For example, "he woulded come back" should be "he would come back." The word "bore" in "help her bore this blow" is incorrect; it should be "bear." 

Looking at syntax, the sentence "He is went away so that he won’t disgrace you any more" uses "went" instead of "gone," which is incorrect. Also, "There’ssed plenty of room" has an extra 's' in 'sedsed' which should be "There's." 

There are a few instances of missing commas or incorrect punctuation. For example, in "If I come back, lass, I’ll be a man," the comma placement is correct, but in "You’re as good as a lad any day, and a better fighter I swear than your daddy," the structure is a bit awkward and could use a comma after "I swear."

Next, checking for coherence. The story is a historical narrative, so I need to ensure the flow is logical. The transition from Debby's situation with her father to the town's decision to send him away is clear. However, the sudden shift from Debby's emotional reaction to the scene with the drummers and Mason's departure feels a bit abrupt. 

There's a part where Debby is taken to Mrs. Lane's house, and the narrative moves quickly to her life there without much explanation of the transition. Also, the mention of her hidden drum and her longing for it is introduced but not deeply explored, which might leave some readers confused. 

The ending of the chapter jumps from Debby's life with Mrs. Lane to her memories of her mother, which is a bit disjointed. The connection between her current situation and the past is there, but the transition could be smoother. 

Overall, the story has a clear progression, but some parts could be more smoothly connected. The archaic language and some awkward phrasing might slightly affect fluency, but it's mostly readable. Coherence is generally good, though there are minor issues with transitions and some abrupt shifts in scenes.
