Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Analysis:

Looking for issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

1. [GRAMMAR] "The subject of the book does not entered into the matter" - This is grammatically incorrect. It should be "does not enter" rather than "does not entered."

2. [SPELLING] I don't see any obvious spelling errors in the text.

3. [SYNTAX] The text generally has complex syntax, but it's well-constructed. There are some long sentences, but they're typical of literary criticism and don't hinder understanding.

4. [PUNCTUATION] There are some ellipses (. . .) used for emphasis or to indicate trailing off, which is appropriate in this context. The punctuation generally appears correct.

5. [WORD CHOICE] The vocabulary is sophisticated and appropriate for literary criticism. The author uses terms like "sinewy English style," "golden argosy," and "Cathedral which towers above the building" which are well-chosen for the context.

Overall, there's one clear grammatical issue that affects fluency, but the rest of the text is highly fluent with natural phrasing and minimal issues.

## Coherence Analysis:

Looking at how the text flows as a whole, with logical sequencing, connected ideas, and clear progression:

1. [LOGIC] The text discusses the value of classic literature versus popular fiction through a series of metaphors and comparisons (cathedral vs. houses, merchantman vs. humble craft). The argument is generally logical and well-structured.

2. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized thematically, moving from the discussion of Mark Rutherford to general principles of literary criticism, then to specific examples of books a "bookman" would collect.

3. [TRANSITION] The transitions between ideas are generally smooth. For example, the author moves from discussing Mark Rutherford to discussing the role of critics, then to Sainte-Beuve's perspective, and then to specific book collections.

4. [CLARITY] The text is generally clear in its argument and expression, though some of the metaphors are quite elaborate and might require some effort to fully grasp.

There are no significant coherence issues. The text maintains a clear logical progression and connects ideas smoothly throughout.

Based on my analysis:

Fluency: I would rate this as a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with sophisticated language and natural phrasing. There's one grammatical error that affects fluency, but it's minor and doesn't significantly disrupt the reading experience.

Coherence: I would rate this as a 5. The text maintains a clear logical progression throughout, with smooth transitions between ideas and a unified argument about the value of classic literature.

Let me double-check my analysis to make sure I'm consistent with the evaluation criteria:

For fluency, the text is highly fluent with clear, natural phrasing and only one grammatical issue. This aligns with a 5 rating, but since there is a grammatical issue, I'll round down to 4.5.

For coherence, the text has a clear and logical progression throughout, with smooth connections between ideas. This aligns with a 5 rating.

I'll now format my answer according to the required format.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "The subject of the book does not entered into the matter" (should be "does not enter")
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] The metaphor comparing books to "houses" and "Cathedral" is somewhat extended and could be clearer in its contrast
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
