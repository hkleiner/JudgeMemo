Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency and Coherence issues in the provided text. 

First, for Fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite long, so I'll go through it paragraph by paragraph. 

Looking at the first sentence: "On the other hand, the war did not interrupt the intellectual life of the country to anything like the same extent as the recent Great War." The phrase "to anything like the same extent as" is a bit awkward. Maybe "as much as" would be smoother, but that's just a minor phrasing issue. 

Next, "At no period since the Elizabethans was there such an output of great poetry; and it does not seem to have occurred to any young lady of that time to ask Scott, Wordsworth or Jane Austen what they were doing during the war." The semicolon here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit long. However, it's still clear. 

In the paragraph about the working class: "It seems in truth to have been very bad." The phrase "in truth" is a bit redundant here. Maybe "It was indeed very bad." But that's a style choice. 

The sentence "Those who want details can find them in the well-know controversial books by the Hammonds..." "Well-know" should be "well-known." That's a spelling error. 

Then, "In 1795 there was actual famine, which was met by the famous system of doles out of the rates, in augmentation of wages, a most mischievous bit of legislation..." The phrase "in augmentation of wages" is a bit unclear. Maybe "as an augmentation of wages" would be better. Also, "waggon-loads" is spelled with two 'g's, which is a spelling mistake (should be "wagon-loads"). 

Moving to the part about families: "Families are restricted whenever the parents have social ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where they have none, the vital statistics was those of Russia, Ireland, India and China." The verb "was" should be "were" because the subject is "statistics." That's a grammar issue. 

In the last paragraph: "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." The phrase "in vulgar language" is a bit jarring here. Maybe "in simple terms" would be more natural. 

Now, for Coherence. The text discusses the effects of the war on intellectual life, working class conditions, and economic factors. The transition between these topics is abrupt. For example, moving from discussing the war's impact on literature to the working class's conditions without a clear transition. 

The paragraph about the Hammonds' books mentions "the well-know controversial books" which is a minor fluency issue, but also, the shift from economic conditions to the Hammonds' books might need a smoother transition. 

The part about over-population and the economists' views is connected to the previous discussion about the working class, but the connection isn't very smooth. The mention of Ireland's famine and the economists' error could be more clearly linked. 

The final paragraph about progress and Macaulay's examples seems to shift focus from the previous economic and social issues to a more general statement about progress. The transition here is abrupt, which affects coherence. 

Also, the text references "my Romanes Lecture on 'The Idea of Progress.'" Since this is a historical text, the mention of the author's own lecture might be confusing if the reader isn't aware of the context. However, since the current section is part of a longer document, maybe that's acceptable, but it could still be a coherence issue if the connection isn't clear. 

Overall, the text covers several topics in a somewhat disjointed manner. Each paragraph introduces a new subject without clear transitions, which affects the overall coherence. The flow from one idea to another isn't always smooth, leading to some abrupt shifts.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "well-know" instead of "well-known"  
- [GRAMMAR] Subject-verb agreement error ("vital statistics was" → "were")  
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" instead of "wagon-loads"  
- [LEXICON] Awkward phrasing ("in augmentation of wages")  
- [SYNTAX] Cumbersome sentence structure in long clauses  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transitions between unrelated topics (e.g., war’s impact on literature to working-class conditions)  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed shifts between economic, social, and literary discussions without clear connections  
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "my Romanes Lecture" (potential confusion for readers unfamiliar with context)  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden jump from famine and over-population to families’ social ambitions  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
