Okay, I need to evaluate the provided text for fluency and coherence using the given criteria. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, the fluency assessment. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons is sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., 'To thee, Thomas Becket...'" The verb tense here is inconsistent. The sentence uses "is sent forth" in past tense, but the context is historical, so it should be "was sent." That's a grammar issue. 

Next, "on June 10 judgment was given in favour of Henry..." There's a missing comma after "Henry" if it's a direct quote. Also, "overlay with gold and sparkling with jewels" should probably be "overlaid" as a past participle. 

In the third paragraph: "Now, I do not disguised the fact..." The verb should be "disguise" instead of "disguised." That's a spelling/grammar error. 

Then, "they was less devout than Chaucer's..." Subject-verb agreement error. "They was" should be "they were." 

Another example: "who for century after century feasted their eyes..." "Century after century" should be "century after century" without the 's' in century. Also, "feasted their eyes" is correct, but maybe "feasted their eyes" is a bit awkward, but it's acceptable. 

Moving to the second chapter: "It would be a mistake to imagine that it solely was due..." The structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe "it was solely due" would be better. 

In the Roman section: "He described them as being little different in their manner of living from the Gauls..." The phrasing is a bit wordy but not incorrect. 

"The Romans called it Durovernum, a name perhaps derived from the British Derwhern, and although their historians are curiously silent in regard to the place there cannot be any doubt..." This is a long sentence. The comma usage might be an issue. Maybe a semicolon or splitting the sentence would help, but it's still understandable. 

In the Saxon part: "Durovernum must have am entirely abandoned..." The correct form should be "must have been entirely abandoned." So a missing "been" is a grammar error. 

Also, "It was probably not until Ethelbert had begun to reigned in 561 that Canterbury became..." The correct verb form after "had begun" should be "reign" (infinitive), so "to reign" instead of "reigned." 

Now, for coherence. The text is a historical narrative. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced, transitions are smooth, and there are no abrupt jumps. 

The first chapter transitions from the historical event of 1538 to the modern pilgrims and then discusses the railway vs. old pilgrimage routes. The flow seems logical. 

In the second chapter, the text moves from the Roman era to the Saxon period. The transition is clear. However, there's a mention of "the earliest people... Pal√¶olithic Age" which is then passed over, which might cause a slight jump. The author mentions they are skipping over certain details, which is okay but could be a minor coherence issue. 

Another point: when discussing the Romans, there's a detailed description of their roads and the city's importance. Then it moves to the Anglo-Saxons. The transition is logical, but the mention of "the Jutes gained possession..." might be a bit abrupt if the reader isn't familiar with the historical context. 

In the Saxon section, the text explains how the city was rebuilt after Roman abandonment. The explanation about the new buildings being above the original level is clear. However, the sentence structure in "So complete was the gap between the destroyed Durovernum and the Saxon town..." is a bit complex but still coherent. 

Overall, the text maintains a logical progression, but there are a few minor issues where transitions could be smoother or explanations more explicit. 

Now, compiling the issues for each category and assigning scores. For fluency, there are several grammar issues (tense, subject-verb agreement, missing words), some spelling errors, and a couple of awkward phrasings. The number of errors is moderate, so maybe a 3.5 or 4. 

For coherence, the text is mostly logical with some minor jumps or abrupt transitions, but nothing that severely disrupts the flow. So a 4 or 4.5. 

But I need to check the exact criteria again. Fluency score 4 is "mostly fluent... minor issues." The text has several errors but they don't disrupt readability much. So 4. Coherence score 4: "mostly coherent, with a few weak parts." The text has a few abrupt transitions but overall is logical. So 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "is sent forth" should be "was sent forth" (tense inconsistency).  
- [GRAMMAR] "overlay with gold" should be "overlaid with gold" (incorrect participle).  
- [GRAMMAR] "they was less devout" should be "they were less devout" (subject-verb agreement).  
- [GRAMMAR] "must have am entirely abandoned" should be "must have been entirely abandoned" (missing auxiliary verb).  
- [GRAMMAR] "had begun to reigned" should be "had begun to reign" (incorrect verb form).  
- [SPELLING] "disguised" should be "disguise" (incorrect verb form).  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "it solely was due to that bloody deed..." (word order).  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from skipping Palaeolithic details to Roman history without clear transition.  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt jump from medieval pilgrims to railway pilgrims in the first chapter.  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous reference to "the Jutes gained possession..." without prior context.  
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between Roman road networks and the Saxon city's rise.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
