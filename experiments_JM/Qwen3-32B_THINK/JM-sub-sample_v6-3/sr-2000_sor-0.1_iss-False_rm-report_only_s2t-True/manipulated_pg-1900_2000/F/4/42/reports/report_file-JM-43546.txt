  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "They was, indeed, and they make many different kinds," (subject-verb agreement error).
        • "we must had a meeting" (incorrect past tense usage).
        • "he was all of a shiver" (awkward phrasing, likely intended as "shivering").
        • "Donald explained, in self-defence" (missing hyphen in "self-defense").
        • "until you have eat a scone" (incorrect past participle "eaten" needed).
    - [SPELLING]:
        • "half-paste four" (incorrect spelling of "half-past").
        • "half-paste" (misspelled as "half-paste" instead of "half-past").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from the puppy story to tea-time description without clear transition.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "Uncle Alan was told us about" (grammatical error obscures meaning).
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt jump between discussing the puppy and the family's tea, with no explicit connection.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Prolonged description of tea details interrupts the narrative flow of the main story.
