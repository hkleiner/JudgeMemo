Okay, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, the fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues. The text is a literary piece, so some complex sentences are expected, but I need to check for errors. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "In the old days of not so long ago the festival begin to excite us in November." The verb "begin" should be "began" because it's past tense. That's a grammar error. 

Next, "the house rustled with charming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper parcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery." The semicolon here might be correct, but the structure is a bit complex. Maybe a period would be better, but it's not a major issue. 

In the second paragraph: "The tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a positive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap." The repetition of "snap" might be intentional for effect, but it's a bit redundant. 

Then: "We did salute the happy morn." The word "salute" here is archaic but used correctly. 

In the third paragraph: "And we ate, and we drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of reasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and dranked without fear and without shame..." The word "dranked" is a typo; it should be "drank." That's a spelling error. 

Another part: "We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we do pretend." The semicolon here might be better as a period. Also, "disillusion" is a noun, but here it's used as an adjective. It should be "disillusioned." That's a grammar issue. 

In the next section: "And what a blessing it will be when the 'festivities' (as they are misleadingly called) are over..." The quotation marks and parentheses are correctly used. 

Then: "We have to induce deliberately the 'Christmas feeling.'" The word order here is a bit awkward. It should be "deliberately induce." That's a syntax issue. 

Looking at the second chapter: "If the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon, confined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children then it follows..." The comma before "then" is missing. That's a punctuation error. 

Also: "They are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary!" The semicolon here is incorrect. A period would be better. 

In the last paragraph: "Another and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our hearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns." The sentence is a fragment but ends the chapter, so it's intentional. 

Now, coherence. The text is a comparison between past and present Christmas experiences. The flow seems logical, but I need to check for transitions and logical sequencing. 

The first chapter sets up the contrast between past and present, using personal anecdotes. The second chapter provides reasoning through historical and logical arguments. The transition between chapters is clear. 

However, in the first chapter, the shift from personal memories to a general statement about society is abrupt. The mention of children's role in maintaining traditions is a bit unclear. 

In the second chapter, the argument about pantomimes and children's role might be a bit tangential. Also, the conclusion about Christmas hymns is a bit abrupt without further explanation. 

Some sentences are long and complex, which might affect readability, but the overall structure is coherent. There are no major logical inconsistencies. 

So, for fluency, there are a few spelling and grammar errors, some awkward phrasing, but overall it's mostly fluent. For coherence, the structure is logical, but there are a few abrupt transitions and unclear parts. 

Final fluency score: Maybe a 4 because of the errors but still mostly readable. Coherence score: 4 as well, with some minor issues in transitions.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "begin" should be "began" in "the festival begin to excite us."  
- [SPELLING] "dranked" instead of "drank."  
- [GRAMMAR] "disillusion" incorrectly used as an adjective; should be "disillusioned."  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward word order in "induce deliberately the 'Christmas feeling.'"  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma before "then" in "If the decadence... children then it follows."  
- [SYNTAX] Incorrect semicolon in "They are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary!"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from personal anecdotes to generalized societal critique in Chapter One.  
- [LOGIC] Sudden transition from children's role to pantomime examples in Chapter Two lacks clear connection.  
- [CLARITY] Unclear linkage between "harlequinade" and the argument about Christmas's historical authenticity.  
- [STRUCTURE] Final sentence in Chapter Two ("lies in the fiery lyrical splendour...") feels abrupt and underdeveloped.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
