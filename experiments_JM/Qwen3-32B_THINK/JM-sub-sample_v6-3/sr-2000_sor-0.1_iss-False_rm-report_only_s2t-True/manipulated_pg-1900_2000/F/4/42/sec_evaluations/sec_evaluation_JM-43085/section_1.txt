Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues

Looking for problems with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

- [GRAMMAR] "he had brought about the passage of cavalry across that field, in order that he might make studies from nature, needed for a painting then in hand, 1807, of how stood grain looks after it had been crushed..." - This sentence has a confusing structure with a misplaced year reference and awkward phrasing.
- [GRAMMAR] "The influence of antiquity... serve only to confine the inspiration of artists more strictly..." - Subject-verb agreement issue (influence serve).
- [GRAMMAR] "The commanding figure of David give a magnificent prestige..." - Subject-verb agreement issue (David give).
- [GRAMMAR] "It was he who brought a new spirit into French painting and, single-handed, wrought a great revolution." - Awkward phrasing and word choice.
- [GRAMMAR] "The question of painting in France had been took on a rather bitter tone." - Subject-verb agreement issue (had been took).
- [GRAMMAR] "the majority made no answer beyond a disdainful silence and some mediocre paintings,--with just one single exception: the admirable, undoubted, impeccable exception of the great Jean-Dominique Ingres." - Awkward phrasing with repeated adjectives.
- [GRAMMAR] "It was promptly heeded by the father, and young Ernest was forthwith entered as a druggist's apprentice..." - Awkward phrasing with "forthwith."
- [SPELLING] "manoeuvres" - This is a British spelling variation.
- [PUNCTUATION] Frequent use of em dashes without consistent formatting (e.g., "One day--it was neither in war time nor during manoeuvres--on a July morning...")
- [PUNCTUATION] Inconsistent use of commas and em dashes in complex sentences.
- [PUNCTUATION] Use of double hyphens "--" instead of em dashes "â€”" in some places.
- [WORD CHOICE] "He was not a very good student. A report had been preserved of his standing in a school in the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, at Paris, where his later childhood was passed." - Awkward phrasing and word choice.

# Coherence Issues

Looking for logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and consistent structure:

- [LOGIC] The text jumps from describing Meissonier's early life to his artistic philosophy without clear transition.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions Delacroix and Ingres but doesn't clearly explain their relevance to Meissonier's story.
- [LOGIC] The text discusses the state of French art but doesn't clearly connect this to Meissonier's development as an artist.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions Meissonier's mother and her artistic abilities but doesn't clearly establish how this influenced his development.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions Meissonier's childhood drawing habits but doesn't clearly connect this to his later career.
- [LOGIC] The text discusses the father's reaction to Meissonier's artistic tendencies but doesn't clearly explain the family's position on art.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions the father making Ernest an apprentice but doesn't clearly explain the connection to his artistic development.
- [TRANSITION] There are no clear transitions between different sections of the text.
- [TRANSITION] The text moves abruptly from one topic to another without clear signaling.
- [STRUCTURE] The text has a somewhat meandering structure that doesn't clearly follow a chronological or thematic progression.
- [CLARITY] Some sentences are long and complex, making it difficult to follow the main points.
- [CLARITY] The text sometimes uses abstract or vague language without sufficient context.
- [STRUCTURE] The text is written in a somewhat discursive, essay-like style that may not be the most effective for a biography.

Based on these issues:

For Fluency:
The text has several grammatical issues (subject-verb agreement problems, awkward phrasing), some spelling variations, and punctuation inconsistencies. However, these don't significantly impede understanding overall.

For Coherence:
The text has some logical jumps and lacks clear transitions between sections. The structure is somewhat meandering and the connections between different ideas are not always clear.

I would rate:
- Fluency: 4 (mostly fluent with some grammatical and punctuation issues)
- Coherence: 3.5 (generally coherent but with noticeable logical jumps and unclear transitions)
