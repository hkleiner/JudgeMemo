Alright, let me analyze the evaluation report and determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

For FLUENCY:
Section 01 has a fluency score of 3.0 with several issues including grammar (7 instances), syntax (1 instance), and spelling (1 instance).
Section 02 has a fluency score of 3.5 with grammar issues (3 instances), syntax (1 instance), and lexical issues (1 instance).

Looking at the recurring problems:
- Grammar errors are common in both sections, with 7 in section 01 and 3 in section 02
- Syntax issues appear in both sections (1 each)
- Section 01 had a spelling error while section 02 had a lexical issue
- The issues are generally minor but recurring

According to the fluency scale:
- Score 3: Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways

Given the recurring grammar issues in both sections, the text falls into the "Score 3" category for fluency. While section 02 is slightly better than section 01, the overall pattern of multiple grammatical issues affecting flow suggests a score of 3.0 rather than 3.5.

For COHERENCE:
Section 01 has a coherence score of 3.5 with issues in transitions (2 instances), logic (1 instance), structure (1 instance), and clarity (1 instance).
Section 02 has a coherence score of 3.5 with issues in structure (1 instance), transition (1 instance), logic (1 instance), and clarity (1 instance).

Looking at the recurring problems:
- Transition issues appear in both sections (2 in section 01, 1 in section 02)
- Logic issues appear in both sections (1 each)
- Structure issues appear in both sections (1 each)
- Clarity issues appear in both sections (1 each)

According to the coherence scale:
- Score 3: Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience

The text has multiple coherence issues in both sections, with noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, and confusing segments. This aligns with a score of 3.0 rather than 3.5. The fact that these issues are present in both sections suggests the problems are consistent throughout the text rather than being limited to one section.

Therefore, my final assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0
