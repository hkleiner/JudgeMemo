Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

First, for fluency. I'll look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling mistakes, or issues with syntax. Let me scan the text.

I notice some hyphenation issues, like "Helsingfors-" at the beginning. Also, there's a missing apostrophe in "it's" later on. Wait, actually, "it's" is correct, but maybe other contractions? Let me check again. The text has "it's narrow, winding alleys" which is correct. Hmm. Then there's a typo in "Shiche-Hache" which is part of a name, so maybe intentional. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "halfrounded" should be hyphenated as "half-rounded". There's also "tinkling in the wind" – the word "tinkling" might be better as "tinkling" or "tinkling". Not sure. Then, "except for the missing gilding still gave reason for the town's name" – the structure here is a bit awkward. The sentence seems to have a misplaced clause. 

In the next part: "we over the ruins of a wall" – missing "went" or "passed". That's a missing verb. Then "one of the most northerly outposts of Chinese civilisation, in the sand and gravel ocean of the Gobi Desert." – the comma usage here might be a problem. Maybe a semicolon or period would be better. 

Further down: "The great high road -- joining K'ou-li (the territory inside the Great Wall) and K'ou-wai (the territory outside) has in North Kansu an E-W direction..." – the dash after "road" might be a long dash, but the sentence structure is a bit complex. Also, "has in North Kansu an E-W direction" – the placement of "has" is a bit awkward. Maybe rephrase to "has an E-W direction in North Kansu". 

There's a missing hyphen in "K'ou-wai" which should be "K'ou-wai". Wait, no, the hyphen is correct as per the original. Then "the outlines ol which could be discerned" – "ol" is a typo for "of". That's a clear spelling mistake. 

In the section about the lamas: "the Chinese officer in command of the Shuangt'ingtzu mounted guard gave unhesitatingly orders that my things shoulded be carried..." – "shoulded" is incorrect. It should be "should be". 

Another typo: "the same language is spoken. Further south, at Bayakhtag and in the mountains south of Kanchow, there are also Huang Fantzu living, but they speak another language which resembles Mongolian, while the language spoken by those mentioned first, has a great resemblance to Khirgis and to the Turkish spoken by the Sarts." – the comma after "mentioned first" might be a problem. Maybe a period instead. 

In the last paragraph: "All the houses I visited were fairly clean, and were build in Chinese style..." – "build" should be "built". 

So, fluency issues include missing verbs, typos, incorrect word forms, and awkward phrasing. These are mostly minor but do affect readability. 

Now for coherence. The text is a descriptive narrative of an expedition. I need to check if the ideas flow logically, transitions are smooth, and the structure is clear. 

The text starts with the expedition's start, then describes the surroundings, the village, the people, their history, the temple, and the lamas. The flow seems logical. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after describing the village, there's a jump to the legend of their origin, which might be a bit sudden. Also, the mention of the Kuzurkei people with tails is a bit out of place. 

The transition from the village description to the temple and then to the lamas is okay. However, the paragraph about the administration and taxation comes a bit abruptly after discussing the lamas. 

There's a lack of clear transitions between some sections. For example, after discussing the language, the text moves to the temple's paintings, which might not be as smoothly connected. 

Overall, the text is coherent but has a few places where the flow could be smoother. The structure is mostly logical, but some transitions are abrupt or lack clear connections. 

For fluency, the issues are mostly minor (typos, missing words, awkward phrasing) but present enough to lower the score from 5. Maybe a 4.5? But some errors are more significant, like the missing verb in "we over the ruins". That's a 2-3 point issue. Wait, the scale for fluency says score 3 has multiple grammatical issues that interrupt flow. The text has several such issues, like missing verbs, typos, incorrect word forms. So maybe a 3.5? 

For coherence, the text is generally coherent but has a few abrupt shifts. The score would be around 4, as it's mostly coherent with a few weak transitions. 

So final fluency score: 3.5, coherence: 4.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] Missing verb in "we over the ruins of a wall" (missing "passed" or "went")  
- [SPELLING] "ol" instead of "of" in "outlines ol which"  
- [GRAMMAR] Incorrect word form "shoulded" instead of "should be"  
- [GRAMMAR] Missing hyphen in "halfrounded" (should be "half-rounded")  
- [SPELLING] "build" instead of "built" in "were build in Chinese style"  
- [STRUCTURE] Awkward phrasing in "except for the missing gilding still gave reason for the town's name"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from village description to the legend of Shiche-Hache with minimal transition  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt introduction of the Kuzurkei people with tails without contextual linkage  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition from lamas' education to administrative details  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
