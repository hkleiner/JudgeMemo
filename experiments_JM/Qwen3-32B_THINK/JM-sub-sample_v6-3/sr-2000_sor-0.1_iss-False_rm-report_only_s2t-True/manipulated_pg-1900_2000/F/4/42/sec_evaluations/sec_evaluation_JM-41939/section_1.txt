Okay, let's start by looking at the Fluency issues in the text. First, I notice some grammar problems. For example, in the sentence "Among his pupils he make the acquaintance of a young girl," the verb "make" should be "made" to match the past tense. That's a [GRAMMAR] issue. Then there's "am taken in his father's studio" where "am" should be "were" because it's plural. Another [GRAMMAR] error. 

Next, I see some spelling mistakes. The word "Silvela" is spelled with a 'v' but the correct spelling should be "Silvel" with an 'l' maybe? Wait, no, maybe that's correct. Wait, actually, in the sentence "to assumed the direction of an institute," the verb should be "assume" without the 'd' because it's after "to," so it's "to assume." That's a [GRAMMAR] issue again. Also, "avoided" in "to avoided the fatal contagion" is incorrect; it should be "avoid" without the 'd.' Another [GRAMMAR] error.

Looking at syntax and structure, there's a sentence that says "The Bonheurs had, at this time, formed a close friendship with a family..." The placement of "at this time" in the middle might be a bit awkward. Maybe a [SYNTAX] issue. Also, in "He went directly to the Silvelas' in the capacity of instructor of drawing," the phrase "in the capacity of" might be better as "as" for smoother reading. That could be a [LEXICON] choice. 

Another thing is the use of "It is not surprising in such an artistic environment, that the child's taste..." The structure here is a bit off. Maybe a [SYNTAX] issue. Also, "She used to go with her comrades, during recess, to play in the Place Royale." The placement of "during recess" could be a [SYNTAX] problem. 

For coherence, the text flows well in terms of narrative progression, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from the family's move to Paris to the school Rosa attended is a bit sudden. That's a [STRUCTURE] issue. Also, the mention of the revolution of 1830 and the subsequent cholera outbreak might not be as smoothly connected as they could be, leading to a [LOGIC] issue. 

There are also some unclear transitions, like the part where Raymond Bonheur moves to different locations due to Saint-Simonism. The connection between his impulsive nature and his moves isn't as clear as it could be, which might be a [TRANSITION] issue. 

Overall, the fluency has several grammatical and spelling errors, but the text is mostly readable. Coherence is generally good, but there are some areas where the transitions and logical flow could be smoother. 

Now, scoring. For fluency, there are multiple grammatical issues, but the text is still understandable. So maybe a 3.5? But wait, the scale says 3 is "multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt flow," and 4 is "minor issues." Since there are several errors but the text is still mostly fluent, maybe a 3.5. For coherence, the structure and transitions have some issues but the overall narrative is coherent. So maybe a 4.0.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "he make the acquaintance" → incorrect tense (should be "made")  
- [GRAMMAR] "am taken in his father's studio" → incorrect verb agreement (should be "were")  
- [GRAMMAR] "to assumed the direction" → incorrect infinitive form (should be "to assume")  
- [GRAMMAR] "to avoided the fatal contagion" → incorrect infinitive form (should be "to avoid")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It is not surprising in such an artistic environment, that the child's taste..."  
- [LEXICON] Redundant phrasing in "in the capacity of instructor of drawing"  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from the family's move to Paris to Rosa's schooling without transitional context  
- [LOGIC] Sudden transition from the 1830 revolution to the cholera outbreak with minimal connection  
- [TRANSITION] Unclear link between Raymond Bonheur's impulsive nature and his Saint-Simonist relocation  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
