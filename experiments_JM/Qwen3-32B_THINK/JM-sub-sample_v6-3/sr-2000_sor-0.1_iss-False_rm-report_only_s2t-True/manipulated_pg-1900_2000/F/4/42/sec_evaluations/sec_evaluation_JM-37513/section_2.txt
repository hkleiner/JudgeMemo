Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues:

# Fluency Issues

Looking at the text for grammatical errors, spelling issues, syntax problems, and awkward phrasing:

1. [GRAMMAR] "lead to the elaboration" should be "led to the elaboration" (past tense inconsistency)
2. [GRAMMAR] "he had striven so strenuously, were not accepted" - the verb tense is inconsistent (past perfect vs. simple past)
3. [GRAMMAR] "to have taken a definite and, for all his detractors may say, an honoured position" - the comma placement is awkward and the phrase is confusing
4. [SPELLING] "Spencerian" - this is a proper noun and should be capitalized consistently
5. [SYNTAX] "It will perhaps be said that this emphasis on the philosophy of life and mind does scant justice to the range and sweep of Spencer's philosophy as a whole" - the sentence is overly long and complex, making it difficult to follow
6. [SYNTAX] "He proclaimed 'the gradual growth of all things by natural processes out of natural antecedents'" - the quotation is awkwardly placed within the sentence
7. [SPELLING] "Spencer widened to men's view the scope of scientific explanation" - "widened to" should be "widened men's view"
8. [SYNTAX] "There is here, it may be said, no special reference to the organic and the superorganic" - the parenthetical phrase disrupts the flow
9. [GRAMMAR] "Are we not again and again bidden, now in forecast, now in retrospect, to looked below the surface" - "looked" should be "look"
10. [SPELLING] "existenced" is incorrect; should be "existence"
11. [GRAMMAR] "We can think of Matter only in terms of Mind. We can think of Mind only in terms of Matter." - the capitalization is inconsistent (Matter and Mind should be lowercase unless they are proper nouns)

# Coherence Issues

Looking at the text for logical flow, clarity, and overall structure:

1. [STRUCTURE] The text jumps between different aspects of Spencer's philosophy without clear transitions
2. [LOGIC] The argument about Spencer's philosophy is complex and at times confusing, with multiple ideas introduced without clear connections
3. [CLARITY] Some concepts like "synthetic philosophy" and "mechanical foundations" are referenced without sufficient explanation
4. [TRANSITION] The text moves abruptly from discussing Spencer's social and political views to his philosophical contributions without clear connections
5. [STRUCTURE] The text has a very academic and dense style that makes it difficult to follow the main argument
6. [LOGIC] The passage contains rhetorical questions that don't always contribute to a clear argument
7. [CLARITY] The meaning of "synthetic philosophy" is not clearly defined for readers unfamiliar with the term
8. [STRUCTURE] The text is organized by topic rather than by logical progression of ideas, making it difficult to follow the overall argument
9. [CLARITY] Some phrases like "the instability of the homogeneous and the multiplication of effects" are unclear without additional context
10. [LOGIC] The conclusion about the relationship between matter and mind is introduced abruptly at the end without clear connection to the preceding discussion

Now I'll assign scores based on the evaluation criteria:

For fluency, the text has several grammatical errors, spelling issues, and awkward syntax. However, these don't completely prevent understanding. The text is still generally readable despite these issues.

For coherence, the text is quite dense and complex, with multiple ideas introduced without clear connections. The academic style makes it challenging to follow the overall argument, and the structure is not always logical. However, there is a general topic (Spencer's philosophy) that is being discussed throughout.

Based on these observations:
- Fluency score: I would give it a 3.5. The text has multiple grammatical and syntactic issues that affect readability, but it's still generally understandable.
- Coherence score: I would give it a 3. The text is dense and complex with some logical issues and unclear transitions, but there is a general topic being discussed and it's not completely incoherent.

Let me refine my assessment:

For fluency, while there are multiple issues, the text is still generally readable and the meaning is mostly clear despite the errors. It's not at the level of a score 2 where comprehension is often difficult.

For coherence, the text has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions, but it's not so incoherent that the overall meaning is lost. There is a clear topic (Spencer's philosophy) being discussed throughout.

So I would revise my scores:
- Fluency: 3.5
- Coherence: 3

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent verb tenses in "lead to the elaboration" and "he had striven so strenuously, were not accepted"
- [GRAMMAR] Awkward phrasing in "to have taken a definite and, for all his detractors may say, an honoured position"
- [SPELLING] Inconsistent capitalization of "Spencerian"
- [SYNTAX] Overly complex and long sentences that make the text difficult to follow
- [SPELLING] Error in "Spencer widened to men's view"
- [SYNTAX] Awkward placement of quotes within sentences
- [GRAMMAR] Error in "to looked below the surface"
- [SPELLING] Incorrect word "existenced" instead of "existence"
- [GRAMMAR] Inconsistent capitalization in "Matter" and "Mind"

2) Coherence Issues: - [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between different aspects of Spencer's philosophy
- [LOGIC] Complex argument structure with multiple ideas introduced without clear connections
- [CLARITY] Unexplained terms like "synthetic philosophy" and "mechanical foundations"
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from discussing Spencer's social/political views to his philosophical contributions
- [STRUCTURE] Dense academic style that hinders comprehension
- [LOGIC] Rhetorical questions that don't contribute to a clear argument
- [CLARITY] Unclear phrases like "the instability of the homogeneous and the multiplication of effects"
- [STRUCTURE] Topic-based organization rather than logical progression
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between the final matter/mind conclusion and preceding discussion

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
