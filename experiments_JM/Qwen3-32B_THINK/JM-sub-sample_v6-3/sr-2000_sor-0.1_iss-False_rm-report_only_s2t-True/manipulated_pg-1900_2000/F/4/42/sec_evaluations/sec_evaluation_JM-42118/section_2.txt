Alright, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the provided Likert scale from 1 to 5. The user has given me a current section to evaluate, and a previous context section which I should ignore for evaluation purposes.

First, I'll read through the current section carefully to detect any issues related to fluency and coherence.

**Fluency Issues:**

1. **[GRAMMAR]** - "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry--this enlargement was mostly done by pupils" - The use of em dash here is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and could be clearer.
2. **[SYNTAX]** - "the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' to guide him" - The syntax is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.
3. **[SPELLING]** - I don't see any spelling errors in the text.
4. **[LEXICON]** - "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry" - The term "enlargement" is used in a technical context and is appropriate, but could be clearer.
5. **[GRAMMAR]** - "the State demanding, however, that the artist should work over it sufficiently to signed his name upon it" - The verb form "signed" should be "sign."
6. **[GRAMMAR]** - "the artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement'" - The use of quotation marks is inconsistent with the previous instance of "painting in little."
7. **[SYNTAX]** - "the artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement'" - The sentence is a bit awkwardly structured.
8. **[GRAMMAR]** - "the artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement'" - The semicolon usage is correct, but the sentence could be clearer.
9. **[GRAMMAR]** - "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry" - The phrase "of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry" is a bit awkward.
10. **[GRAMMAR]** - "the State demanding, however, that the artist should work over it sufficiently to signed his name upon it" - The phrase "sufficiently to signed" has a grammatical error.

**Coherence Issues:**

1. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text jumps from one historical figure to another without clear transitions (e.g., from Fragonard to the Director-General of Buildings to Damiens).
2. **[LOGIC]** - The connection between Fragonard's training and the events related to the Director-General and Damiens is not clearly established.
3. **[TRANSITION]** - The transition from Fragonard's training under Boucher to the appointment of the Director-General is abrupt.
4. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text moves from one historical event to another (e.g., from Fragonard's training to the Damiens incident) without clear narrative flow.
5. **[LOGIC]** - The relevance of the Damiens incident to Fragonard's story is not clear.
6. **[CLARITY]** - Some parts of the text are dense with information and could benefit from clearer organization.
7. **[STRUCTURE]** - The text mixes narrative of Fragonard with broader historical events without clear separation.
8. **[LOGIC]** - The connection between the appointment of the Director-General and Fragonard's subsequent career is not clearly established.

Now, I'll assess the scores based on these issues:

**Fluency Score:**
The text has several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing, but it is generally readable. The most serious issues are the grammatical errors in "signed" and the awkward sentence structure. I would rate this as a 3.5 - it's generally readable but has multiple issues that affect flow and clarity.

**Coherence Score:**
The text has some coherence, but the jumps between topics and lack of clear transitions make it difficult to follow the narrative. The connection between Fragonard's story and the broader historical events is not clearly established. I would rate this as a 3 - it's generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions.

Let me double-check my assessment:

Fluency: The text has several grammatical errors (like "signed" instead of "sign") and some awkward phrasing. However, it's generally readable and the meaning is clear. A 3.5 seems appropriate as it has noticeable issues but is still understandable.

Coherence: The text moves between topics without clear transitions and sometimes lacks logical connections between events. The narrative is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts. A 3 seems appropriate as it has coherence issues that affect the reading experience.

Let me finalize my assessment.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "signed his name" should be "sign his name"
- [GRAMMAR] "he was also required to paint an 'enlargement' of the size that the weavers had to make into tapestry"
- [SYNTAX] "the head of the factory keeping custody of the 'painting in little' to guide him"
- [GRAMMAR] "the State demanding, however, that the artist should work over it sufficiently to signed his name upon it"
- [SYNTAX] "the artist painted his picture 'in little'; he was also required to paint an 'enlargement'"

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Fragonard's training to the appointment of the Director-General
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between Fragonard's story and the Damiens incident
- [TRANSITION] Lack of clear transition between different historical events
- [STRUCTURE] Jumps between Fragonard's personal narrative and broader historical context
- [LOGIC] Unclear relevance of the Damiens assassination to Fragonard's story

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
