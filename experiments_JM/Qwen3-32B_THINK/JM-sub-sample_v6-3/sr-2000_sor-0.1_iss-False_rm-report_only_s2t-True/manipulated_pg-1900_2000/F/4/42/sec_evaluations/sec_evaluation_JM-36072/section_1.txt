Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to assess the fluency and coherence of the given text. 

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me go through the text line by line.

First paragraph: "We may find more than one reason for this." That's fine. "The great man is link to his age by his weakest side;" – wait, "link" should be "linked". That's a spelling or grammar issue. 

Next: "The last century and a half, beginning with what Arnold Toynbee was the first to call the Industrial Revolution..." Hmm, the structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe "what Arnold Toynbee called..." without "was the first to" makes it smoother. But the current phrasing is a bit clunky. Could be a syntax issue.

In the next paragraph: "The French monarchy was stricken with mortal disease before Louis XV bequeathed his kingdom..." "Bequeathed" is correct, but the sentence is a bit wordy. Maybe not a major issue. 

Then: "But there can was no question..." – "can was" is incorrect. Should be "can be no question". That's a grammar error. 

Another part: "The greatest sufferings cause by the revolution..." – "cause" should be "caused". Spelling/grammar. 

Also: "a new social order is being built up" – since the context is past tense, maybe "was being built up". But the author might be using present tense for generality. Not sure if that's an error. 

Looking for other issues: "and this new knowledge, not content with practical applications, soon revolutionised all the natural sciences..." – the phrase "not content with practical applications" is a bit jarring. Maybe a syntax issue. 

Now for coherence. The text is about the Victorian Age, discussing historical movements, the Industrial Revolution, and societal changes. The flow seems logical, but are there abrupt shifts or unclear transitions? 

In the paragraph starting with "Let us spend five minutes...", there's a shift from discussing the Industrial Revolution's impact to a detailed description of pre-industrial England. The transition is a bit abrupt. Maybe a [STRUCTURE] issue. 

Another part: "The necessary changes would have come about earlier but for the French Revolution and the war." This connects the previous discussion about aristocracy and political corruption to the French Revolution's impact. The logic is there, but the connection could be smoother. Maybe a [LOGIC] issue. 

Also, the text references historical figures and events, which might require prior knowledge. If the reader isn't familiar with these, it might be confusing. But since it's a historical text, some references are expected. 

Overall, the text is well-structured with a clear progression, but there are a few places where transitions could be smoother. The fluency has some minor errors that don't greatly disrupt reading but are noticeable.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [GRAMMAR] "The great man is link to his age by his weakest side" (incorrect verb form "link" instead of "linked")  
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing: "beginning with what Arnold Toynbee was the first to call the Industrial Revolution" (redundant phrasing)  
- [GRAMMAR] "But there can was no question that the river of civilisation..." (incorrect verb tense "can was")  
- [GRAMMAR] "The greatest sufferings cause by the revolution" (incorrect verb form "cause" instead of "caused")  
- [GRAMMAR] "and now was dispersed to the winds" (incorrect verb tense "was" instead of "are")  
- [GRAMMAR] "They am not content" (incorrect verb form "am" instead of "are")  
- [GRAMMAR] "till Napoleon is out of the way" (incorrect tense "is" instead of "was")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from abstract historical analysis to detailed description of pre-industrial England in "Let us spend five minutes..." paragraph  
- [LOGIC] Slightly abrupt transition from discussion of aristocracy to the French Revolution's impact on political reforms  
- [CLARITY] Some complex historical references (e.g., "Sybel," "Toynbee") may require contextual knowledge for full comprehension  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
