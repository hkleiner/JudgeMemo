Let me analyze the evaluation report to determine appropriate final scores for coherence and fluency.

For FLUENCY:
Section 01 has a score of 3.5 with significant grammar issues, spelling problems, and awkward phrasing. The issues include incorrect verb tenses, word choice problems, and confusing sentence structures.
Section 02 has a slightly better score of 4.0, but still has grammar problems (tense inconsistency, incorrect verb forms), spelling issues, and syntax problems. The complex sentence structure in the hymns passage is specifically noted.

The recurring issues across both sections include:
- Grammar problems with verb tenses and forms
- Spelling inconsistencies
- Awkward or complex sentence structures
- Hyphenation inconsistencies

For COHERENCE:
Section 01 has a score of 3.5 with issues in structure (abrupt transitions, disconnected discussions), logic (unclear explanations and connections), clarity (ambiguous references), and transitions (sudden shifts).
Section 02 has a score of 3.5 with logical confusion in explanations, structural jumps without transitions, and unclear connections between ideas.

The recurring coherence issues across both sections include:
- Abrupt transitions between sections and topics
- Disconnected or disjointed information
- Unclear explanations and logical connections
- Ambiguous or confusing references
- Sudden shifts in discussion topics

Based on these patterns:

For FLUENCY:
The text shows moderate fluency with many grammatical and structural issues that affect readability, but it's generally understandable. The issues are consistent but not so severe as to make the text difficult to follow. A score between 3.5 and 4 would be appropriate. Given that Section 02 is slightly better but still has significant issues, I'll go with a 3.5 as the final fluency score.

For COHERENCE:
The text has noticeable coherence problems with frequent abrupt transitions, disconnected ideas, and unclear explanations. While some parts are understandable, the overall coherence is affected by these issues. The coherence issues are more severe than the fluency issues, so I would rate it slightly lower than the fluency score. A score of 3.0 would be appropriate for coherence.

Wait, I need to reconsider my assessment. Let me look at the scale more carefully:

For FLUENCY:
- Score 3: "Generally readable and mostly fluent, but contains multiple grammatical or structural issues that interrupt the flow or clarity of the text in noticeable ways."
This seems to fit well with the evaluation report showing multiple grammatical and structural issues in both sections.

For COHERENCE:
- Score 3: "Generally coherent, but contains noticeable abrupt shifts, unclear transitions, or confusing segments that are not resolved and affect the reading experience."
The report mentions multiple instances of abrupt transitions, unclear explanations, and confusing segments, which aligns with this description.

So my final assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.0

Actually, let me reconsider once more. The fluency issues in both sections are significant but the text remains generally readable. Section 02 actually has a 4.0 fluency score, which is better than Section 01's 3.5. Given that one section is at the higher end of the 3-4 range, I think a 3.5 is more appropriate for the overall fluency score.

For coherence, both sections are at 3.5, with similar issues across both. The coherence issues are more severe than the fluency issues, but they don't make the text impossible to understand. I think a 3.5 is appropriate for the overall coherence score.

My final assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
