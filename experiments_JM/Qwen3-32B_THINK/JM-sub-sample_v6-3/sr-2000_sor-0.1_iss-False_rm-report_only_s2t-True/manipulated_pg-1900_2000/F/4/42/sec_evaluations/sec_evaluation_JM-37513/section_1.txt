Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of this text. The user provided a long excerpt from a philosophical work discussing Spencer's philosophy of science. First, I need to check for grammatical errors, syntax issues, spelling mistakes, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

Looking through the text, I notice some possible issues. For example, in the sentence "to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave," the structure is a bit awkward. It might be clearer if it were rephrased, but as it stands, the flow is a bit choppy. Also, there's a missing article in "read Tyndall's Discourse on The Scientific Use of the Imagination" â€“ it should be "reading" instead of "read." That's a spelling/grammar issue.

Another point is the use of "prevailed" in "to prevailed." The correct form should be "to prevail," so that's a grammar mistake. There's also a comma splice in "I was a willing slave. And here in one glowing sentence..." which could be fixed with a semicolon or a period. 

Looking at the quote from Tyndall, the line "not alone the more ignoble forms..." has some awkward phrasing. It might be better as "not only the more ignoble..." but the current structure is a bit repetitive. 

In the sentence "Only by shutting one's eyes to the light that had been shed on the world by evolution could one failed to see..." the verb "failed" should be "fail," so that's a spelling error. 

There's also some inconsistent use of quotation marks and punctuation. For instance, the quote from the Westminster Review is followed by a comma, but the structure of the sentences around it could be smoother. 

Now, moving on to coherence. The text is a reflective piece on Spencer's philosophy, and it does follow a logical progression, discussing the author's introduction to Spencer, the ideas of evolution, and the implications. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, the shift from discussing Tyndall to the friend's reaction is smooth, but then the text moves to Herbert Spencer without much transition. 

The coherence is generally good, but there are parts where the connections between ideas could be clearer. For instance, the discussion about the universality of differentiation and its implications jumps between different contexts (biological, societal) without clear transitions. Also, the conclusion about Spencer's contributions feels a bit rushed, especially when moving from his strengths to his limitations. 

Another point is the use of complex sentences that might confuse the reader. For example, the sentence starting with "There is I think a growing consensus..." has a misplaced "I think" and could be restructured for clarity. 

Overall, while there are some minor fluency issues and a few coherence points where transitions could be smoother, the text maintains a logical flow and is mostly understandable. The fluency issues are mostly minor, and the coherence is generally strong, though some sections could benefit from clearer connections between ideas.
