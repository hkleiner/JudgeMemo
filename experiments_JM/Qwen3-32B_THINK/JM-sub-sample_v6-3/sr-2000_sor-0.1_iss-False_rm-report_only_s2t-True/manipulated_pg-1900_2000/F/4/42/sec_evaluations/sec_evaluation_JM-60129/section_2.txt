Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let me start by reading through the current section carefully.

First, for fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation issues. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "build in Chinese style" – should be "built". Then "turn Mongolian wooden cups" – maybe "a few Mongolian wooden cups"? Also, "a certain remedy against sickness" – maybe "a certain protection"? 

Next paragraph: "The clothes were cut in Chinese fashion but usually made of home-spun material." "Home-spun" is correct. "The men wear a Chinese cap with a button, or a Mongolian felt cap, a long coat, or fur coat..." – the list structure is a bit confusing. Maybe missing commas or conjunctions. 

In the women's dress section: "The fur coat worn by both men and women is usually bordered with fur..." – repetition of "fur". "was of better quality" – tense shift from present to past? 

In the head-dress description: "use by the Chinese as thimbles" – missing "used". "Even in the grave it is not all removed..." – maybe "not all of it is removed". 

Moving to the Sarö Yögur section: "The women was busy" – should be "were". "The two latter, hardly to be called masculine occupations, are performed by the men." – awkward phrasing. 

Spelling: "Khirgis" vs. "Kirgiz"? Not sure, but if that's the correct term, it's okay. "tshokh" and "lan" are probably correct as they are terms in the context. 

Now, coherence. The text transitions between different aspects of the houses, clothes, and daily life. The flow is logical, moving from one room to another, then to clothing, then to the Sarö Yögur. However, there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after discussing the head-dress, it jumps to the Sarö Yögur without a clear transition. Also, the mention of the Sarö Yögur's clothing and their lack of holiday attire comes suddenly after the detailed description of head-dresses. 

Some parts are repetitive, like the mention of "home-spun" multiple times. Also, the explanation of the currency (70 tshokh etc.) is a bit jarring in the middle of the description of cloth. 

The text is mostly coherent, but the transitions between sections could be smoother. Some sentences are long and could be broken up for better readability. However, the overall structure is logical and follows a clear progression from one topic to the next, even if there are some minor issues in transitions.
