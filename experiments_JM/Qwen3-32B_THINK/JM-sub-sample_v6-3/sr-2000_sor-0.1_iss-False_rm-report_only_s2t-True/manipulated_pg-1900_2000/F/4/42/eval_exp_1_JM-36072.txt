Alright, let's break down the evaluation report to determine the final scores for Coherence and Fluency.

**Fluency Analysis:**
The report shows that both sections have a score of 3.5 for fluency. Looking at the issues:
- There are multiple grammar issues in both sections, with incorrect verb forms and tenses. Examples include "link" instead of "linked," "can was," and "cause" instead of "caused."
- Spelling errors in section_02 include "well-know" and "waggon-loads."
- Syntax and lexicon issues are present, such as awkward phrasing and cumbersome sentence structures.

These issues are recurring and affect the smooth flow of the text, but they don't make the text entirely unreadable. The score of 3.5 suggests generally readable but with multiple issues that interrupt the flow.

**Coherence Analysis:**
Section_01 has a score of 4.5, while section_02 has a score of 3.5 for coherence. Looking at the issues:
- Section_01 has a sudden shift from abstract historical analysis to detailed description and some abrupt transitions.
- Section_02 has more significant coherence issues with disjointed shifts between topics, unclear references, and sudden jumps in content.

The coherence issues are more pronounced in section_02, with frequent inconsistencies and disconnected ideas. The overall coherence seems to be affected by these problems across both sections.

Based on these observations, I would rate the final scores as follows:

**Coherence:**
The text has noticeable coherence issues, particularly in section_02 with frequent inconsistencies and disjointed shifts. The score is between 3 and 4, with a slight lean towards the lower end due to the significant issues in section_02. I would rate it as 3.5.

**Fluency:**
The text has multiple grammatical and syntax issues in both sections, but it remains generally readable. The score is between 3 and 4, and since both sections scored 3.5, I would maintain that rating for the final fluency score.

Now I'll format the final answer as requested.
