Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. First, I'll read through the current section to get a sense of it. The text is a narrative about Kuei Ping's memories and her internal conflict between family expectations and the ideals she learned at school. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. Let me scan through each sentence.

The first sentence: "This was the memory she conned over most often." The word "conned" is a typo. It should be "coned" or "dwelled on." That's a spelling/word choice issue.

Next: "Kuei Ping had stood first in her class..." The sentence is okay, but "had stolen away into the garden" uses past perfect correctly. Then, "Ever since that day Kuei Ping had worn it next to her heart." The tense here is past perfect, which is correct if referring to a past event from another past event. Maybe okay.

"In memory the fragrant perfume of the la France roses..." The phrase "In memory" might be a bit awkward. Maybe "In her memory" would be better. That's a phrasing issue.

"she recalled the crunching sound Miss Porter’s stiff foreign shoes had made as she came down the path, and the tenseness of the principal’s voice..." The structure here is a bit long, but the commas are used correctly. However, "tenseness" is a bit awkward. Maybe "tense" is more common.

"While they sit in the arbor she had hold Kuei Ping’s hand..." The verb tenses are mixed here. "While they sit" is present tense, but the rest is past. Should be "While they were sitting..." and "had held."

"Kuei Ping thrilled to the memory of that touch more than to the glow of the pearls." The phrasing "thrilled to the memory" is okay, but maybe "thrilled at the memory" is more natural.

"Miss Porter built for the girl who listen at her side that afternoon..." The verb "listen" should be "was listening."

"that connected the road of Kuei Ping’s life with that strange land called the United States..." The phrase "the road of Kuei Ping’s life" is a bit awkward. Maybe "the path of her life."

"For at the spring holidays Madame Yen have told her granddaughter..." The verb "have" should be "had."

"Kuei Ping had know that from the first moment..." "Know" should be "known."

"They awaited her return home and her fulfillment of their plans for her." The phrase "fulfillment of their plans" is correct, but maybe "fulfillment of their plans for her" is better.

"bonds that could not be pushed aside with the brusqueness that made possible the spirit of freedom..." The phrasing here is a bit convoluted. Maybe "could not be pushed aside as brusquely as the spirit of freedom..."

"The latter had been a trifle curt." "The latter" refers to the refusal, which is clear, but the sentence is a bit abrupt.

"Kuei Ping had weep bitter tears over it since..." "Weep" should be "wept."

"The utter futility of attempting to make East and West understand each other had still her lips..." The word "still" is used as a verb here, which is correct but the phrasing is a bit awkward. Maybe "silenced her lips."

"the engagement bracelets in the bureau in her mission school room and the silver honor medal beneath her dress were each sacred things..." The phrase "sacred things that belonged in separate parts of her life" is a bit wordy. Maybe "sacred items that belonged in separate parts of her life."

"Madame Yen reached over now to Kuei Ping for the pearls she had taken from the table..." The phrasing is a bit awkward. Maybe "Madame Yen reached over to Kuei Ping to retrieve the pearls she had taken from the table..."

Overall, there are several grammatical errors (tense, subject-verb agreement), word choice issues, and awkward phrasing. Let me list these under fluency.

Now for coherence. The text is a memory segment, so transitions between ideas and consistency are important. The narrative flows through Kuei Ping's memories, but there are some abrupt shifts. For example, after talking about her time at school and Miss Porter, it jumps to her family's plans for marriage. The connection between these parts is there, but the transition is a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of the engagement bracelets and the silver medal is sudden, which might confuse the reader if they didn't know the context from the previous section. However, since the previous section is provided for context, maybe it's okay. The overall structure is logical, but some parts could be smoother. The internal conflict between family and personal desires is clear, but the flow between the memories and the present situation (with the pearls and Madame Yen) could be better connected. There's a mix of past and present tense in the narrative, which is handled for a memory, but some parts might be confusing. For example, "In memory the fragrant perfume..." starts with a present tense phrase, which is a bit jarring. The use of "In memory" instead of "In her memory" makes it less clear. Also, the ending with the chair-bearers waiting seems a bit disconnected from the rest of the narrative, but that might be part of the context from the previous section. Overall, the coherence is mostly good, but there are some transitions and connections that could be improved.
