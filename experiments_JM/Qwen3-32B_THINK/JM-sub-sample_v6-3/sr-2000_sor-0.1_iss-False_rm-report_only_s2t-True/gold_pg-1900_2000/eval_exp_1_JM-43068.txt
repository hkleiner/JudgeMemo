Let me analyze the evaluation report and determine the final scores for coherence and fluency.

For fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.0 with issues in grammar, punctuation, word choice, and semicolon misuse.
- Section 02 has a score of 4.5 with issues in syntax, lexicon, and transitions.

Overall, both sections are mostly fluent but have some issues. Section 1 has more noticeable problems with grammar and punctuation, while Section 2 has complex syntax and slightly archaic phrasing. The scores average around 4.25, but I should consider the severity of the issues.

For coherence:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.5 with issues in structure, logic, and clarity.
- Section 02 has a score of 4.0 with similar issues in structure, logic, and clarity.

The text appears to have a generally coherent structure but with some noticeable shifts and unclear connections between ideas. The scores average around 4.25 as well.

Based on these evaluations and the scoring criteria:
- Fluency: The text is mostly fluent with some minor issues that don't significantly disrupt readability. I would rate it as 4.0.
- Coherence: The text is generally coherent but has noticeable abrupt shifts and some unclear connections between ideas. I would rate it as 4.0.

Let me finalize my assessment:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
