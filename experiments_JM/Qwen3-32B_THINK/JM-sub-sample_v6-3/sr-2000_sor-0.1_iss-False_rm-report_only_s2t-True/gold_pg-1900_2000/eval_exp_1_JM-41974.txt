Let me carefully analyze the evaluation report to determine the final Coherence and Fluency scores for the entire text.

First, I'll examine the Coherence issues across both sections:

Section 01:
- Sudden shift from Veronese's personality to biographical details without clear transition
- Minor inconsistency in tense ("If his preference *is* for the joyous scenes of life" in a historical narrative)
- Abrupt jump from his early works to the Mantua cathedral commission without contextual linkage

Section 02:
- Smooth transitions between Veronese's collaborations, his move to Venice, and his artistic philosophy
- Final paragraph about Veronese's disregard for historical accuracy is well-integrated
- Descriptions of his style are consistently tied to earlier examples

For Coherence, Section 01 had some issues with structure and transitions, while Section 02 showed strong coherence. The problems in Section 01 were mostly minor or isolated instances rather than pervasive issues. The overall text appears to maintain a logical progression with some minor lapses.

Now for Fluency issues:

Section 01:
- Awkward clause structure in one specific sentence
- Overly complex sentences with nested clauses
- Redundant phrasing
- Missing commas in long descriptive phrases

Section 02:
- Use of archaic terms that may feel outdated but aren't incorrect
- Some long and complex sentences that are grammatically correct
- Overuse of colons and semicolons in descriptive lists that could be simplified but don't hinder readability

Section 01 had more significant fluency issues, including grammar, syntax, and punctuation problems. Section 02 had mostly minor issues that didn't affect readability.

Based on the evaluation, I'll now determine the final scores:

For Coherence:
The text has some minor issues in Section 01 but shows strong coherence in Section 02. The problems in Section 01 are isolated and don't significantly disrupt the overall flow or understanding. I would rate this as "mostly coherent, with a few weak or slightly disconnected parts" which aligns with a score of 4.5.

For Fluency:
Section 01 had several notable issues with grammar, syntax, and punctuation, while Section 02 had mostly minor issues. The overall text has some grammatical and structural issues that interrupt the flow, but they don't make comprehension difficult. This aligns with a score of 4.

So my assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
