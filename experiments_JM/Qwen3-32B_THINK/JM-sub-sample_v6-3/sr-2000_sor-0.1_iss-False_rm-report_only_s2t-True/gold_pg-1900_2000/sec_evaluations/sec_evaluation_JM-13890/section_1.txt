Okay, let's start by looking at the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, and word choice. I need to check for any errors that might disrupt the flow.

First, I notice that the text is quite old and written in a historical style, which might use archaic language. For example, phrases like "It was on April 24, 1538, that a writ of summons was sent forth in the name of Henry VIII., 'To thee, Thomas Becket, some time Archbishop of Canterbury'..." have a formal tone. The use of "some time" instead of "former" might be archaic but not incorrect. 

Looking for spelling errors, I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "contumacy" and "iconoclasm" are correctly spelled. The punctuation seems correct, though there are some long sentences that might be a bit complex, but they don't necessarily hinder fluency.

Grammar-wise, the sentences are structured correctly. For example, "But the days passed, and no spirit having stirred the venerated bones of the wonder-working saint..." uses a participle correctly. However, there's a possible issue with the phrase "the shrine once destroyed ended for ever this first phase..." which might be a dangling modifier. It should be "Once the shrine was destroyed, it ended..." but the current structure could be confusing.

In terms of syntax, some sentences are quite long and complex, which might make them a bit hard to follow, but they don't contain errors. For example, "Now, I do not disguise the fact that many of the twentieth-century pilgrims are not possessed of the true spirit of the devotee, and instead of approaching the object of their journey by the old-time way, along the beautiful hills of Surrey and Kent, they use the iron road which rushes them all unprepared into the city of the saint-martyr." This is a long sentence, but the structure is correct.

Word choice is generally appropriate, though some archaic terms like "cosmopolitan groups of travel-soiled men and women" might be less common but are used correctly.

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a chapter from a book, so it's expected to have a clear progression of ideas. 

The first chapter starts with the historical event of Thomas Becket's shrine being destroyed and then moves to the current state of pilgrimage. The transition is smooth, with the author addressing modern pilgrims and comparing them to medieval ones. The second chapter discusses the history of Canterbury, starting from prehistoric times through Roman and Saxon periods. The structure here is logical, moving chronologically.

However, there are a few points where the flow could be slightly disrupted. For example, in the first chapter, the sentence "The lukewarm pilgrim should therefore remember that he will add vastly to the richness of his impressions if he deserts his train at Selling or Chartham and walks the rest of the way over Harbledown..." introduces a recommendation that might feel a bit abrupt after discussing the modern vs. medieval pilgrims. The transition from discussing the lack of true spirit in modern pilgrims to suggesting an alternative route is a bit sudden.

In the second chapter, the discussion of the Roman period and the transition to the Saxon period is logical, but the mention of the Dane John and the Roman roads is detailed and might be dense for some readers. However, the author does provide explanations, so it's not necessarily a coherence issue.

Another point is the use of terms like "the first view of the Cathedral city set in the midst of soft-swelling eocene hills..." The term "eocene" refers to a geological period, which might be a bit technical, but the context explains it through description, so it doesn't hinder coherence.

Overall, the text is well-structured, with clear sections and logical progression. The main issues are minor and don't significantly disrupt the flow. For fluency, the main problem is the possible dangling modifier in the shrine sentence. For coherence, the abrupt transition in the first chapter and the dense information in the second chapter are the main issues. 

Considering the fluency scale, the text has a few minor issues but is mostly fluent. I'd rate fluency around 4.5. For coherence, the logical structure is maintained despite the minor transitions, so a 4.5 as well.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "the shrine once destroyed ended for ever this first phase..." (dangling participle construction)  
- [LEXICON] "cosmopolitan groups of travel-soiled men and women" (archaic/ambiguous phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em-dashes and long sentences without clear breaks  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from medieval pilgrims to modern pilgrimage route suggestions in Chapter I  
- [STRUCTURE] Dense historical detail in Chapter II without clear thematic connections between paragraphs  
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of "the first view of the Cathedral city" in Chapter I without prior context
