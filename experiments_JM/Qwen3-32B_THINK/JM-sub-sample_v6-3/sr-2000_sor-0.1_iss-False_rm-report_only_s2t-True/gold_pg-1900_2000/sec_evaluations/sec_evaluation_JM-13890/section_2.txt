Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

## Fluency Analysis:

I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling issues, and other fluency problems.

1. "It was probably not until Ethelbert had begun to reign in 561 that Canterbury became the most important place in Kent, and at that time the site of the Cathedral was outside the town walls."
   - [GRAMMAR] "It was probably not until Ethelbert had begun to reign" is awkward phrasing. It would be more natural to say "It was probably not until Ethelbert began to reign."

2. "This title reveals the fact that the new settlers had by this time fixed their limits in Kent..."
   - [REDUNDANCY] "Reveals the fact that" is redundant; "reveals that" would be sufficient.

3. "He even provided them with quarters in Canterbury, and in the old church of St. Martin outside the city..."
   - [PUNCTUATION] The comma splice between "quarters in Canterbury" and "in the old church" is a minor issue.

4. "It seems unlikely that the influence of the queen and her good chaplain should have been entirely without results..."
   - [WORD CHOICE] "Should have been" is slightly archaic and could be simplified to "was."

5. "Bishop Luidhard, whose name should always be linked with that of St. Augustine, appears to have died soon after the arrival of Pope Gregory's mission..."
   - [WORD CHOICE] "Should always be linked" is a bit awkward; "is always associated" would be more natural.

6. "It took England nearly nine centuries to make up its mind to rid itself of the stultifying authority of the Bishop of Rome and to shake itself free from monasticism and the various forms of idolatrous worship which grew up in the sultry atmosphere of the Papal Church;"
   - [PUNCTUATION] The semicolon at the end of this long sentence is inappropriate and should be a period.

7. "The zeal and enthusiasm of the band of missionaries began to bring in many converts."
   - [WORD CHOICE] "Band of missionaries" is a bit awkward; "group of missionaries" would be more natural.

8. "And the imminence of further change carries with it no danger of any break in this long association of Canterbury with ecclesiastical control..."
   - [WORD CHOICE] "Imminence" is an awkward word choice; "possibility" or "prospect" would be more natural.

9. "As the first church mentioned in history associated with Christian worship St. Martin's occupies a unique position..."
   - [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "worship" before the proper noun "St. Martin's."

10. "Cautious archæologists, represented by Mr. J. T. Micklethwaite, regard the earliest work in St. Martin's as belonging to the Saxon period..."
   - [SPELLING] "Archæologists" has an unusual archaic spelling; "archaeologists" is more standard.

Overall, the text has several minor issues that affect fluency but is generally well-written and readable.

## Coherence Analysis:

I'll look at the logical flow, structure, and overall coherence of the text.

1. "Ethelbert, it should be mentioned, had extended his power so far beyond the confines of Kent..."
   - [STYLE] This parenthetical insertion is somewhat jarring and disrupts the flow.

2. "He even provided them with quarters in Canterbury, and in the old church of St. Martin outside the city, where Queen Bertha had been in the habit of worshipping with her chaplain, Augustine and his monks began to preach and instruct all who cared to listen."
   - [COMPLEXITY] This is a very long and complex sentence that would be clearer if broken into shorter sentences.

3. "It seems unlikely that the influence of the queen and her good chaplain should have been entirely without results, and it is quite possible that Augustine found the ground prepared for the seed he diligently began to sow."
   - [ABSTRACTION] The metaphor "seed he diligently began to sow" is somewhat abstract and could be clearer.

4. The text jumps from discussing Ethelbert and Augustine to the historical development of St. Martin's church without a clear transition.
   - [TRANSITION] The shift from the religious conversion narrative to the architectural history of St. Martin's is abrupt.

5. The final paragraphs discuss the future of Canterbury as a religious center and the uncertainty about St. Martin's origins, which seems to be a new topic introduced without clear connection to the previous content.
   - [STRUCTURE] The text introduces a new topic without a clear transition or introduction.

6. The text mixes different time periods (Roman, Saxon, modern) without always making it clear which time period is being discussed.
   - [TIME FRAME] The temporal context is sometimes unclear.

Overall, the text has a logical progression through much of the content, but there are some abrupt transitions and shifts in focus that affect coherence.

## Final Scores:

For Fluency:
The text has several minor issues but is generally well-written and readable. I would rate it a 4.5, as the issues are mostly minor and do not significantly disrupt comprehension.

For Coherence:
The text has a logical progression through most of its content but has some abrupt transitions and shifts in focus that affect the overall flow. I would rate it a 4.0, as the issues are noticeable but do not significantly disrupt understanding.
