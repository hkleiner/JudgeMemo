Alright, I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence. Let's start with fluency. The text is quite long, so I'll need to scan through it carefully. 

First, checking for grammar and syntax. The sentences are complex, which is common in literary prose, but I need to see if there are any errors. For example, "The teacher had sometimes a brief season of apathy on hot afternoons..." uses an archaic structure. "Had sometimes" might be better as "sometimes had" for modern fluency. That's a minor issue. 

Looking for spelling errors. I don't notice any obvious misspellings. Words like "congress" shoe might be a typo, but in context, it's likely referring to the shoe's design, so maybe intentional. 

Punctuation seems correct, but there are some long sentences that might be hard to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "He was one incarnate Why and How..." is a run-on but still understandable. 

Word choice and phrasing: Some phrases are a bit archaic or poetic, like "dark close, sultry spot" which is okay for style but might be considered awkward by some readers. However, since the text is literary, these choices might be intentional rather than errors. 

Now for coherence. The text transitions from Anthony's childhood antics to his laziness in school, then to his curiosity and self-education. The flow seems logical. However, there's a shift from his school days to his mother's perspective and his knowledge of plants. The connection between his laziness and his curiosity is clear, but the transition to discussing his mother's view might be abrupt. 

There's a mention of Edgewood and his mother's doubts, which ties back to his self-education. The examples of plants he knows support his inquisitive nature. The overall structure is coherent, but the jump from the teacher's desk to his mother's perspective could be a minor issue. 

Looking for abrupt shifts or unclear transitions. The part where he's under the teacher's desk and then suddenly the text moves to his mother's viewpoint might need a smoother transition, but it's not too jarring. 

In terms of consistency, the narrative maintains a focus on Anthony's character and his traits. The questions he asks about nature and existence tie into his inquisitive nature. 

Overall, fluency has minor issues with archaic phrasing and some long sentences, but they don't hinder understanding. Coherence is mostly smooth, with a few transitions that could be clearer but don't disrupt the overall flow. 

For fluency, I'd say a 4.5. The text is mostly fluent with some minor issues. For coherence, a 4.5 as well, since it's mostly coherent with a few minor transitions that could be smoother.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "The teacher had sometimes a brief season of apathy" (archaic/awkward word order).  
- [LEXICON] "dark close, sultry spot" (ambiguous phrasing; "close" could mean "enclosed" or "near").  
- [SYNTAX] Long, complex sentences (e.g., "He was one incarnate Why and How...") may strain readability.  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing commas in compound sentences (e.g., "He could also fashion an interesting musical instrument in his desk by means of spools and catgut and bits of broken glass").  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Sudden shift from Anthony’s school behavior to his mother’s perspective ("His mother, who owned him...") lacks smooth connection.  
- [CLARITY] "the triangle of black elastic in the teacher’s ‘congress’ shoe" (vague reference to an object).  
- [LOGIC] Jump from Anthony’s philosophical musings to his mother’s doubts about his "useless information" feels abrupt.  
- [STRUCTURE] Repetition of "Why" questions dilutes narrative momentum.  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
