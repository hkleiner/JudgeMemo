Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The text is quite long and complex, so I need to look for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice.

First, I'll scan through the sentences. The first paragraph seems okay. The sentence structure is complex but correct. Words like "insistent factor" and "reluctant recognition" are a bit formal but not incorrect. 

Looking at the next part: "Beyond the attention that religion, as formally conceived, has begun to command is a widespread revival of spiritual search." The structure here is a bit inverted, but it's a stylistic choice and not grammatically wrong. 

In the sentence about the search for justice and international peace, the phrasing "tend to have the effect of also arousing new perceptions" is a bit wordy, but it's still understandable. 

The part about "movements like environmentalism and feminism induce a re-examination..." has a clear structure. 

The sentence about the acceleration of migration in religious communities is a bit long but still coherent. 

The mention of "extraterrestrial sightings, 'self-discovery' regimens, wilderness retreats..." has a list that's well-structured. 

The reference to the Bahá'í and the tale of Majnún is a bit complex, but the sentence is grammatically correct. 

The next chapter starts with a clear statement. The following paragraphs discuss historical forces and materialist enterprise. The sentences are complex but correct. 

Looking for any spelling errors: I don't see any. Words like "Bahá'í" and "Bahá'u'lláh" are correctly spelled with the accents. 

Punctuation seems appropriate. Commas are used correctly in complex sentences. 

Word choice is formal and academic, which fits the context. There's no jargon that's unclear. 

Now, checking for coherence. The text discusses the revival of spiritual search and its various manifestations. The transition from the first paragraph to the second is smooth, discussing the effects of the spiritual search. 

The mention of environmentalism and feminism as examples of movements that induce self-examination is logical. 

The shift to the acceleration of migration in religious communities is a bit abrupt but still follows the theme of spiritual search. 

The part about extraterrestrial sightings and New Age practices is a bit of a jump, but it's presented as examples of the broader phenomenon. 

The reference to the Bahá'í and the ancient tale of Majnún ties back to the theme, showing a connection. 

The next chapter discusses the historical forces leading to the reawakened interest in religion. The transition is smooth, discussing the bankruptcy of materialism. 

The explanation of the materialist enterprise and its consequences is logical. The mention of totalitarian regimes and their collapse is a coherent argument. 

The part about other social systems and the evidence of social pathologies follows logically. 

The conclusion that the fate of development has left no doubt is a clear statement. 

Overall, the text flows logically from one idea to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one. The ideas are connected and support the main thesis. 

For fluency, there are no major errors. The text is well-written, with complex sentences that are still clear. 

For coherence, the structure is logical, with each section following the previous one. The examples provided are relevant and support the argument. There are no abrupt shifts or confusing transitions. 

So, the fluency score would be a 5, as there are minimal issues. The coherence score would also be a 5, as the text is highly coherent with a clear progression.
