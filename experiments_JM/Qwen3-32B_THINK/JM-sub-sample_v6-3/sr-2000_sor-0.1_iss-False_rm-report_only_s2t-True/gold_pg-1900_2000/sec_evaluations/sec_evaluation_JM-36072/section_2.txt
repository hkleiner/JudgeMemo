Let me evaluate the provided text on the two metrics of fluency and coherence.

First, I'll analyze for fluency issues (grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation):

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "We however who have witnessed..." - This sentence has a misplaced modifier that makes it confusing.
- [SYNTAX] "It had the double effect of pauperising the rural labourer and of putting an artificial premium on large families--the children who were carted off in waggon-loads to feed the factories." - This sentence is long and complex, making it difficult to follow.
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" - This appears to be a spelling error (should be "wagon-loads").
- [SYNTAX] "The dominions beyond the seas were being peopled up and consolidated." - "Peopled up" is an awkward phrasing.
- [SYNTAX] "The country was, in vulgar language, a going concern, as it never was before and has not been since." - This sentence is somewhat awkwardly constructed.
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" - This appears to be a spelling error (should be "wagon-loads").
- [PUNCTUATION] "In Ireland the barbarous and illiterate peasantry multiplied till the population exceeded eight millions, when the inevitable famine illustrated nature's method of dealing with recklessness." - This sentence could use a semicolon or a period to separate the two independent clauses.
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" - This appears to be a spelling error (should be "wagon-loads").

Now, I'll analyze for coherence issues (logical progression, connection of ideas, clarity, and structure):

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] The text jumps from discussing the war's impact on intellectual life to the condition of the working class, then to overpopulation, then to progress in the first half of the reign. These shifts in topic are abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The text lacks clear transitions between different topics and ideas, making it difficult to follow the overall argument.
- [CLARITY] Some concepts are presented without sufficient context or explanation, making them harder to understand.
- [LOGIC] The discussion of overpopulation is introduced abruptly after discussing the war and its effects.
- [LOGIC] The text shifts from discussing economic conditions to discussing progress and complacency without clear transitions.
- [STRUCTURE] The flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed, with multiple topics being discussed in a somewhat random order.
- [LOGIC] The text moves from discussing economic conditions to discussing family size and social ambitions, then to progress in the first half of the reign, without clear connections between these topics.
- [CLARITY] The text occasionally uses complex or archaic language that may be difficult for some readers to understand.
- [LOGIC] The text discusses various economic and social conditions but doesn't clearly connect them to form a cohesive argument.

Now, I'll assign scores:

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
The text has some logical progression and does connect related ideas, but there are noticeable abrupt shifts in topic and lack of clear transitions between ideas. The discussion jumps from the war's impact on intellectual life to the working class, then to overpopulation, then to progress, without sufficient connections between these topics. While the text does cover related themes (economic conditions, social change), the flow is somewhat disjointed.

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
The text is mostly fluent and well-structured, though it contains some minor issues in grammar and phrasing. There are a few awkward or complex sentences that could be clearer, and there's one spelling error ("waggon-loads" instead of "wagon-loads"). However, these issues are relatively minor and do not significantly disrupt the overall readability of the text.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] Misplaced modifier in "We however who have witnessed..."
- [SYNTAX] Long and complex sentence about the double effect on rural labourers
- [SPELLING] "waggon-loads" appears to be a spelling error
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing "peopled up"
- [SYNTAX] Awkward construction in "The country was, in vulgar language..."
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing appropriate punctuation between independent clauses
- [SPELLING] Repeated "waggon-loads" spelling error

2) Coherence Issues:
- [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between topics (war impact, working class, overpopulation, progress)
- [STRUCTURE] Lack of clear transitions between different sections
- [CLARITY] Some concepts presented without sufficient context
- [LOGIC] Sudden introduction of overpopulation discussion
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed flow of ideas across multiple topics
- [LOGIC] Unclear connections between economic conditions and social topics
- [CLARITY] Use of complex/archaic language in some passages
- [LOGIC] Disconnected discussion of economic conditions and progress

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
