Alright, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency looks at grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll go through the text and check for any issues.

First, I notice there's a typo in "Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia." The possessive apostrophe is correct, but the abbreviation "Gen." is used here. That's acceptable in historical texts. Next, there's a sentence that says "So far not one had succeeded in destroying Lee’s army or in capturing Richmond." The word "So far" at the beginning might be a bit abrupt, but it's not a major issue. 

Looking further, in the section about the Union Movements and Confederate Movements, there's a list of battles and dates. The formatting here is a bit inconsistent. The dates are written in different formats: "MAY 5-7, 1864" versus "JUNE 1864-APRIL 1865." Also, the list items are not properly formatted as bullet points or separated with proper punctuation. This could be a formatting issue rather than a fluency problem, but it might affect readability. 

In the chapter "UNION STRATEGY 1864," the sentence "It was the upper arm of the movement which was directly concerned with Richmond and Petersburg." The phrase "upper arm" is a bit confusing. It might be a metaphor, but it's not commonly used, which could lead to ambiguity. 

Another part that stands out is "the advance was begun. City Point, located at the junction of the James and Appomattox Rivers and soon to be the supply center for the attack on Petersburg, was captured on May 4, 1864." The transition here is a bit abrupt. The phrase "the advance was begun" is passive voice and might be better in active voice for clarity. 

In the section about the Battle of the Wilderness, there's a sentence: "Here Meade’s Army of the Potomac, numbering approximately 118,000 troops, fought the Confederate defenders of Richmond." The word "Here" at the beginning is a bit vague since it's not immediately clear where "here" refers to. It would be better to specify the location after mentioning the battle. 

There's also a sentence: "Lee had about 62,000 men with him, while an additional 30,000 under Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard held the Richmond-Petersburg area." The use of "while" here is correct, but the sentence structure is a bit long and could be split for better readability. 

In the chapter "STRATEGIC PETERSBURG," the sentence: "Through it passed a constant stream of war materials and necessities of life from the South to sustain the straining war effort." The phrase "straining war effort" is a bit awkward. A more natural phrasing might be "the strained war effort" or "the war effort under strain." 

Overall, the text is mostly fluent. There are some minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasings, but they don't significantly disrupt the readability. The historical context and the use of military terminology are appropriate, and the overall structure is clear. 

Now, moving on to coherence. Coherence looks at how the text flows logically, the transitions between ideas, and the overall structure. 

The text is divided into chapters, which is a good organizational structure. However, the transition between the "PROLOGUE" chapter and the "UNION STRATEGY 1864" chapter could be smoother. The "PROLOGUE" sets up the context of the war up to 1864, but the transition to the specific strategy is a bit abrupt. A sentence or two to bridge the two chapters would help. 

In the "UNION STRATEGY 1864" chapter, the text mentions the two-pronged attack involving William T. Sherman and the Army of the Potomac. The explanation of the "upper arm" of the movement is a bit confusing. It's not immediately clear what the "upper arm" refers to, and it might be better to use a more explicit term like "northern front" or "main thrust." 

The section about the Army of the James is briefly told, but the transition to the Battle of the Wilderness is a bit abrupt. The reader might need a clearer connection between the two events. 

In the section about the Battle of Cold Harbor, the quote from Grant is relevant but comes after a detailed description of the battle. The placement of the quote might be a bit late, and it could be introduced earlier to set the context for the battle's outcome. 

In the "STRATEGIC PETERSBURG" chapter, the explanation of Petersburg's strategic importance is clear, but the transition from the general description of the city to its role in the war is a bit abrupt. A sentence linking the city's geography to its strategic value would help. 

Overall, the text is coherent, with a logical progression from the prologue to the specific strategies and battles. However, there are some minor issues with transitions between sections and the use of certain terms that could be clarified. The structure is mostly clear, and the ideas flow logically, but a few smoother transitions would enhance the coherence.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "The advance was begun" (passive voice weakens clarity)  
- [STRUCTURE] Inconsistent date formatting in battle list (e.g., "MAY 5-7, 1864" vs. "JUNE 1864-APRIL 1865")  
- [LEXICON] Ambiguous phrasing: "upper arm of the movement" (unclear metaphor)  
- [CLARITY] "straining war effort" (awkward word order)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from "PROLOGUE" to "UNION STRATEGY 1864" without bridging context  
- [LOGIC] Unclear explanation of "upper arm" (confuses reader about strategic focus)  
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden transition from Army of the James to Battle of the Wilderness (lacks linkage)  
- [CLARITY] Quote from Grant placed after battle details (contextual timing mismatch)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
