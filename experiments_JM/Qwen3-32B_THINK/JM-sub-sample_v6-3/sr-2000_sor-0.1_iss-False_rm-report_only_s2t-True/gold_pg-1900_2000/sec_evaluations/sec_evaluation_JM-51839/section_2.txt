Alright, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. First, I need to assess the fluency and coherence of the current section provided. 

Starting with **Fluency**. The text is quite lengthy, so I'll scan through for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. The sentences are mostly well-structured, but I notice some places where the phrasing could be smoother. For example, "in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and bewildered followers" â€“ "harassed and bewildered followers" might be a bit of a mouthful, but it's clear. There's also "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity, somewhere between the Sabine and Red rivers." The phrase "shadowy, uncertain quantity" is a bit unusual but not incorrect. I don't see any major grammar issues or spelling mistakes. There are some complex sentences, but they don't hinder understanding. Maybe a few instances where the syntax is a bit heavy, but overall, the fluency is strong. I might deduct a half point for minor awkward phrasing in a couple of places.

Moving on to **Coherence**. The text is a historical narrative, so coherence would depend on how logically the ideas flow and how well the transitions are made. The section starts by discussing the founding of Nacogdoches as a civic corporation, then moves to Ybarbo's role, the construction of the Stone House, his governance, the population growth, the investigation leading to his removal, and then shifts to the Philip Nolan chapter. The transition from the first chapter to the second is marked by a new chapter heading, which is standard. However, the connection between the two chapters isn't immediately clear from the text itself. The first chapter ends with "Nacogdoches was at that time the second largest town in Texas." The next chapter starts with "In 1800 Nacogdoches was a loyal Spanish town..." There's a time jump from the 18th century to 1800, which is logical, but the transition could be smoother. Also, the mention of the Philip Nolan expedition and its suppression by the town is a new topic that might not be directly linked to the previous discussion of Ybarbo's governance. However, since it's a new chapter, it's expected to have a new focus. There's a clear progression within each chapter, but the shift between chapters might be abrupt without the context of the chapter headings. The internal coherence within each chapter is good, but the overall structure between the two chapters could be slightly disjointed. This might warrant a minor deduction for a slight lack of transition between the chapters, but since the chapters are separate, maybe that's acceptable. I'd say the coherence is mostly good with a few minor issues in transitions between sections.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and bewildered followers"
- [LEXICON] Unusual phrase "shadowy, uncertain quantity" could be clearer
- [SYNTAX] Complex sentence structure in "The eastern boundary of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity..."

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift between chapters without transitional sentences
- [LOGIC] Jump from Ybarbo's governance to Philip Nolan's expedition feels abrupt
- [TRANSITION] Weak connection between final sentence of first chapter and opening of second chapter

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
