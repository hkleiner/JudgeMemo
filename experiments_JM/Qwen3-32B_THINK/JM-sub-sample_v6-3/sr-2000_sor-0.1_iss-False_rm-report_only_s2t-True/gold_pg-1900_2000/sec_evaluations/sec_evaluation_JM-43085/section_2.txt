Alright, let's start by reading through the current section carefully. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of this text, which is a continuation of a story about Meissonier's early career. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or issues with word choice. Let me scan the text. 

I notice some parts where the sentence structure is a bit complex, like "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers in republican uniform, dragoons, artillerymen and their horses." This sentence is a bit long and the clauses are connected without clear punctuation, making it a bit confusing. That's a syntax issue. 

There's also a phrase like "He passed his days in an enclosure adjoining the studio, where the master was engaged upon his ceiling painting for the Louvre, the Expedition into Egypt, and hired by the day soldiers..." Here, "hired by the day soldiers" might be a syntax problem because it's unclear if the soldiers were hired by the master or by someone else. Maybe it's supposed to be "hired soldiers by the day," but the structure is awkward. That's another syntax issue.

Looking at other parts, "He was unable to enter the classes of Paul Delaroche, the monthly charge for admission to the studio from which The Princes in the Tower had issued reaching the exorbitant sum of twenty francs!" The structure here is a bit off. The main clause is "He was unable to enter," followed by a non-restrictive clause, but the way it's phrased with "reaching the exorbitant sum" is a bit confusing. It might need a comma or rephrasing. That's a syntax issue again.

For coherence, I need to check if the ideas flow logically and transitions are smooth. The text starts with Meissonier overcoming his father's opposition, then moves to his time at different studios, his financial struggles, and his early exhibitions. The transitions between these events are generally smooth, but there are a few places where the flow could be better. 

For example, after talking about his financial struggles, the text jumps to him exhibiting at the Salon. The transition from his poverty to his first exhibition is a bit abrupt. It might benefit from a sentence connecting these two events, but since it's a single paragraph, it's acceptable. 

Another point is the mention of his collaboration with Daubigny to manufacture canvases for export. The text moves from his financial struggles to this collaboration, then back to his attempts to get into Delaroche's class. The shift between these events is a bit sudden, which could be a coherence issue. Maybe a transition word would help, but without it, the flow is slightly disrupted. 

Also, the part where the publisher initially rejects his illustrations but then the conversation about life-masks leads to a providential turn is a bit abrupt. The connection between the rejection and the life-masks isn't clearly explained, making the transition a bit confusing. That's a coherence issue related to transitions. 

Now, considering the scale for fluency. The text has a few syntax issues and some awkward phrasing, but overall, it's readable. The errors don't severely hinder understanding, so maybe a 4. For coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions and a lack of clear connections between some events. However, the overall structure is logical. I'd say a 4 as well, since the problems are minor and don't significantly disrupt the flow.
