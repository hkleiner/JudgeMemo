Let me evaluate the text based on the two metrics: fluency and coherence.

## FLUENCY ASSESSMENT

Looking at the text, I'll identify any issues with syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation.

- [GRAMMAR] "It was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement without precedent in the history of the world" - This is an unusual phrasing and slightly awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "The incidents concurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement" - The phrasing is awkward and the grammar is convoluted.
- [SPELLING] I don't see any obvious spelling errors.
- [SYNTAX] "The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will prove to be pregnant with interest" - The phrase "prove to be pregnant with interest" is awkward and somewhat archaic.
- [PUNCTUATION] "The ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just fallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth meridian" - The punctuation is correct but the sentence is long and complex.
- [PUNCTUATION] "We passed on and as their fountains of spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his wonted devotion before the shrine of night" - This sentence is long and could be split for clarity.
- [LEXICON] "The United States Army Transport 'Thomas' swung out into the middle of the bay" - The word "swung" might be better replaced with "steered" or "moved."
- [GRAMMAR] "Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of the Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of teachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment" - The phrasing is awkward and the sentence is long.
- [GRAMMAR] "We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming morn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the nearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the town" - This is a very long sentence with complex structure.
- [GRAMMAR] "There are royal documents to prove that more than one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old idol" - The phrasing is awkward.
- [GRAMMAR] "The feathers of which this strange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color" - The phrasing is awkward and could be simplified.
- [GRAMMAR] "The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this royal robe" - This is a passive construction that could be more direct.
- [PUNCTUATION] "The wind which always blows in tropical countries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a mountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force" - This is a long sentence that could be split.
- [GRAMMAR] "The value of the robe is over three hundred thousand dollars" - This is clear but the context suggests it might be an overstatement.

Overall, the text has some grammatical awkwardness and complex sentence structures, but it's generally readable and understandable. I would rate the fluency as a 4 - mostly fluent with some minor issues in grammar and phrasing.

## COHERENCE ASSESSMENT

Now I'll assess the coherence of the text, looking at logical sequencing, connected ideas, clear progression, and overall structure.

- [LOGIC] The text jumps abruptly from the preface to the historical event of 1901, then to the departure of the ship, then to Hawaii, then to various museums and cultural practices, then to the International Date Line, and finally to Manila. The transitions between these topics are abrupt.
- [STRUCTURE] The narrative structure is disjointed, with many different topics covered without clear connections between them.
- [CLARITY] The text is descriptive but lacks a clear narrative thread or purpose that connects all the different elements.
- [TRANSITION] There are few transitional phrases to help the reader follow the shifts in topic and location.
- [LOGIC] The text mentions the International Date Line and the "Revels of Neptune" in a historical context, but these seem disconnected from the main narrative about the teachers going to the Philippines.
- [STRUCTURE] The text moves from the departure of the ship to the history of Hawaii to cultural practices to the date line to Manila, without a clear narrative progression.
- [CLARITY] The text includes many descriptive passages that are interesting in themselves but don't contribute to an overall coherent narrative.

The text is descriptive and detailed, but it lacks a clear narrative structure or logical progression that would make the different elements cohere into a unified whole. The transitions between topics are often abrupt, and the overall structure is somewhat disjointed.

I would rate the coherence as a 3 - generally coherent but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear transitions that affect the reading experience.
