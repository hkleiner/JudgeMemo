Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the current section. The user wants me to look for issues in syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. 

First, I'll go through the text line by line. The first sentence is "This was the memory she conned over most often." The word "conned" here might be a typo. It should probably be "coned" or "consoled," but "conned" is a verb meaning to deceive, which doesn't fit. So that's a spelling/word choice error.

Next, "Ever since that day Kuei Ping had worn it next to her heart." The pronoun "it" refers to the "small remembrance reward," which is clear, but maybe the sentence could be more concise. However, that's more about style than fluency. 

Looking at "In memory the fragrant perfume of the la France roses at the end of the walk drifted out to her again," the structure here is a bit awkward. "In memory" is a prepositional phrase that could be rephrased for smoother flow. Maybe "The fragrant perfume of the la France roses drifted out to her again in memory." That's a syntax issue.

Then, "she recalled the crunching sound Miss Porter’s stiff foreign shoes had made as she came down the path," the use of "foreign" here might be redundant since "stiff foreign shoes" is clear. Not a major issue. 

Moving on, "Kuei Ping thrilled to the memory of that touch more than to the glow of the pearls." The phrase "thrilled to the memory" is okay, but the comparison with "glow of the pearls" is a bit unclear. Maybe "thrilled more than to the pearls' glow." But it's not a major fluency problem.

In the sentence "Miss Porter built for the girl who listened at her side that afternoon, a dream bridge of words that connected the road of Kuei Ping’s life with that strange land called the United States," the comma placement after "afternoon" is correct, but the sentence is a bit long. However, it's not a grammar error. 

The phrase "the Chinese girl with her brilliant mind trained to new ways might return to give service to her own country women." The use of "trained to new ways" is a bit awkward. Maybe "trained in new ways" would be better. That's a phrasing issue.

In "Kuei Ping had held her breath lest she lose a word while Miss Porter talked, quiet at first, carried away by the marvel of the opportunity, then very still because she knew its impossibility." The structure here is a bit convoluted, but it's more about clarity than fluency. 

"Her family loved her. Kuei Ping had known that from the first moment she opened her eyes and smiled into her mother’s face." The transition between these sentences is smooth, but the use of "Kuei Ping had known that from the first moment..." might be better as "Kuei Ping had known that from the first moment she opened her eyes and smiled into her mother's face." The repetition of "had" is correct.

The sentence "There were ties that bound her a part of the whole which made up the unit of her family, bonds that could not be pushed aside with the brusqueness that made possible the spirit of freedom that lit the eyes of the American girl." This is a complex sentence with multiple clauses. The structure is a bit heavy, but it's grammatically correct. The phrase "bound her a part of the whole" is a bit awkward. Maybe "bound her as part of the whole" would be better. That's a syntax issue.

"Kuei Ping had wept bitter tears over it since, because she had failed the person she admired most in all the world." The placement of "since" might be better as "since then" for clarity. However, it's not a major error.

Overall, the main fluency issues are the spelling/word choice error with "conned" and some awkward phrasing. There are a few instances where the sentence structure could be smoother, but they don't severely impact readability. So for fluency, I'd say it's mostly fluent with minor issues, so a 4.

Now for coherence. The text is a continuation of the previous section, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if there are any abrupt shifts or unclear transitions.

The current section starts with "This was the memory she conned over most often," which is a bit confusing if "conned" is a typo. If it's "coned" or "consoled," it's still a bit unclear. The transition from the previous section, which ended with "It was graduation day," to this section is okay, but the first sentence is a bit abrupt.

The narrative continues with Kuei Ping's memory of her graduation and the subsequent events. The flow from the memory to the present (with Madame Yen and the pearls) is handled through the narrative, but the shift from the memory to the present might be a bit abrupt. However, the text uses "Madame Yen reached over now to Kuei Ping..." to indicate the return to the present. That's a good transition.

The internal conflict Kuei Ping faces is presented clearly, with her thoughts on her family's expectations versus the freedom she admired in Miss Porter. The cause and effect are logical. The mention of the engagement bracelets and the medal as sacred things is clear in the context.

However, there's a part where it says "The latter had been a trifle curt." The "latter" refers to Miss Porter's response, which is clear, but the transition from Kuei Ping's decision to the curt response is a bit abrupt. It might be better to have a sentence connecting the decision to the response.

Another point is the mention of the engagement bracelets and the medal as sacred things in separate parts of her life. This is clear, but the connection between the two is not explicitly made, which could be a minor coherence issue. However, given the context, it's understandable.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a few minor issues in transitions. The main ideas are connected logically, and the narrative flows from the memory to the present. So for coherence, I'd give a 4.5, as there are a few minor issues but the overall structure is clear.
