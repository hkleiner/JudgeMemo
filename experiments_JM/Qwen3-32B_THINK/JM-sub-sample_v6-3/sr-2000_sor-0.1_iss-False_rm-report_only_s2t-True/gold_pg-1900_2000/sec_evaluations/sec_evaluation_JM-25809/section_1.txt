Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of this text. The passage is a chapter from a story, so I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation issues.

First, I'll look for any obvious grammatical errors. The sentence structure seems mostly correct, but there are a few places where the syntax might be a bit awkward. For example, "He looked at the hollow of the gulch and cursed it manfully and bitterly." The use of "manfully" here is a bit old-fashioned but not incorrect. 

Next, there's a line: "The gold should be there--Jim had figured it all out." The em dash here is correct, but sometimes em dashes can be overused. However, in this case, it's used appropriately to introduce a parenthetical statement. 

Another part that stands out is the letter from Anne. The dialogue is in italics or quotes, but since the text is in a narrative style, the formatting might not be crucial. However, the line "Dearest Jim--And again I must say 'no.'" The use of an em dash here is correct for a sudden shift in thought. 

Looking at word choice, there are some archaic terms like "manfully" and "owly," which might be intentional for the story's setting or style, so they don't count as errors. 

I notice a few commas missing in some places. For example, in "He could not call her mercenary. He knew better." These are two separate sentences and are correctly separated by a period. 

There's a sentence: "You may rest your soul in peace on one point." The phrase "rest your soul in peace" is a bit unusual, but it's a literary expression and not a grammatical error. 

Overall, the text is quite fluent. There are minor issues with some word choices and punctuation, but they don't disrupt the flow significantly. The narrative is well-structured, and the sentences are clear. I would rate the fluency a 4.5, as there are a few minor issues but nothing that hinders understanding.

Now, moving on to coherence. The passage is a chapter from a story, so I need to check how well the ideas are connected and the logical flow.

The chapter starts by describing the gulch and Jim's situation. The transition to the letter from Anne is a bit abrupt, but since it's a narrative device, it's acceptable. The letter itself is a coherent part of the story, explaining Anne's reasons for rejecting Jim's proposal. 

There's a shift in perspective from the external description of the gulch to Jim's internal thoughts and then to the letter. This shift is handled well, but there could be a smoother transition between the letter and the subsequent actions of Jim. 

The dialogue with Bud at the end introduces a new element, but it's well integrated into the narrative. The conversation flows naturally, and the characters' interactions are coherent. 

However, the line "You call for what you want, and the cashier will make good." is a bit confusing in context. It seems like Bud is telling Jim to take what he wants, but the meaning is a bit unclear. This might be a minor issue in clarity. 

The overall structure of the chapter is logical. The problem of the gulch, Jim's frustration, the letter, and the interaction with Bud all contribute to the narrative. There are no major inconsistencies or abrupt shifts that disrupt the coherence. 

I would rate the coherence a 4.5 as well. The story is well-structured, but there are a couple of minor points where the flow could be smoother, especially in the transition between the letter and the dialogue with Bud.
