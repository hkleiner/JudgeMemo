Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the given text for fluency and coherence using the Likert scale from 1 to 5, including half points. The user provided a detailed text about Joshua Reynolds and the evaluation criteria. 

First, I'll tackle the fluency issues. The text is quite long, so I need to scan through it for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or spelling mistakes. Let me read through it carefully.

Looking at the first paragraph: "They are strangers to doubt and uncertainty; they disarm Fortune by claiming freely as a right what she is accustomed to grant grudgingly as a favour--"they ride Life's lists as a knight might ride." The em dash and the quotation marks here might be a bit inconsistent. Maybe the em dash should be a colon or a semicolon? Also, the phrase "Life's lists" is a bit unclear. 

Next, "One feels that these fortunate few are destined for success just as the majority are doomed to failure, that nothing save a long series of mishaps can keep them from the goal of their ambition." The structure here is a bit complex. The use of "save" might be archaic, which could be a style choice but might affect fluency for some readers.

In the section about Reynolds: "Such gifts, if they do not always create a genius, may enable their possessor to achieve work that has certain affinities with the masterpieces of the immortals." The phrase "affinities with the masterpieces of the immortals" is a bit abstract and might be confusing. 

Looking further: "The painter may be said to have owed his first success to Commodore Keppel, who took him on a cruise in the Mediterranean and helped him to come into touch with the great masterpieces that will probably stimulate artists for all time." The phrase "come into touch" is a bit awkward. Maybe "come into contact" would be better. Also, "will probably stimulate" uses future tense in a historical context, which might not be correct.

In the paragraph about Italy: "Art will not yield to inspiration alone. The musician, or the literary man, with very simple education may be able to achieve wonders, but the artist who looks to brushes and colours for his medium must sacrifice diligently for many years at the shrine of technique before his hand can express what is in his brain." The structure here is a bit long and complex. The phrase "sacrifice diligently" might be better as "diligently sacrifice" for smoother flow.

Moving to the section about Reynolds' early life: "Before the time of apprenticeship had expired Reynolds had quarrelled with his master and gone back to Devonshire, where he painted work that was of no great importance, under the patronage of the first Lord Edgcumbe." The sentence is a run-on. It might be better to split into two sentences for clarity.

In the part about Michelangelo: "In later days he never lost an opportunity of advising students to sit at the feet of the great master, and the influence of the work in the Sistine Chapel may be noted in the famous picture of Mrs. Siddons, now to be seen in the Dulwich Gallery." The phrase "now to be seen" is a bit awkward. Maybe "now on display" would be smoother.

Looking at the paragraph about the discourses: "A musican knows that the laws of harmony and counterpoint are not fixed, that the musical horizon widens year by year..." The misspelling of "musician" as "musican" is a spelling error. Also, the sentence structure is a bit convoluted, making it hard to follow.

Finally, the paragraph about Reynolds' return to England: "While his sojourn abroad had been productive of so much that had been invaluable to him, he had met with two unfortunate accidents." The phrase "productive of so much" is a bit wordy. Maybe "yielded much" would be better.

Now for coherence. The text is a biographical essay, so it should have a logical flow. Let's check the structure. The introduction talks about men destined for success, then introduces Reynolds. The next paragraphs discuss his qualities, his influence, his education, and his career. The flow seems logical. However, some transitions between paragraphs might be abrupt. For example, after discussing his Italian journey, the text jumps to his return to England and health issues. There's also a mention of Sir Walter Armstrong's opinions, which might be a bit out of place. The section about the discourses and his teaching methods is a bit dense and could be clearer. The overall structure is coherent, but some parts could have smoother transitions or more logical sequencing.

Putting it all together, the fluency issues are mostly minor but present in several places, affecting the flow. The coherence is mostly good but has some areas where the transitions or structure could be improved.
