Okay, let's start evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency. I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite long, but I'll go through it carefully. 

I notice some commas used where they might not be necessary, like in "I was ready to go out into the world with a college diploma, but was unprepared for a definite position." The comma after "diploma" is a serial comma, which is acceptable, but maybe a semicolon would be better. However, it's not a major issue.

Another spot: "I must not accept just a mere job, and to escape that humiliation I became a teacher." The phrase "just a mere job" has redundancy. "Mere" and "just" are both used, which is repetitive. Also, the comma before "and" here might be a problem. It's a comma splice. 

Looking at "The situation that confronted me after deciding to become a teacher temporarily, and two ways of meeting it, can be illustrated..." The comma after "temporarily" might be a problem. The sentence structure here is a bit awkward. It should probably be two separate sentences or use a semicolon. 

In the part about the janitor arranging seats: "He said he didn't know just which way the desks should face, as no one had told him, but he remembered that the pupils needed plenty of light..." The comma usage here is okay, but the sentence is a bit long. Maybe breaking it into two sentences would improve readability. 

The text also has some awkward phrasing, like "I made no comment, as remarks were unnecessary." It's a bit redundant. "Remarks were unnecessary" could be rephrased for clarity. 

Moving on to coherence. The text is a narrative with two main stories about two different men. The transition between the two stories is a bit abrupt. After describing the first man's experience, the text jumps to the second man without a clear transition. The reader might need a smoother connection between the two examples. 

The structure of the text is generally logical, with each chapter addressing a different aspect of entering the teaching profession. However, within the first chapter, the shift from the author's personal experience to the two examples could be more clearly introduced. The examples are used to illustrate the point, but the connection between the author's initial reluctance and the two men's experiences could be clearer. 

There's also a part where the author discusses the second young man's actions in fixing the classroom seats. The explanation about seat distances and how it solved the "teacher problem" is a bit technical and might be confusing if not clearly connected to the previous points. The reader might need more context on why seat distance affects order in the classroom. 

Another point is the mention of the 1916 meeting in Detroit. Since the text is about entering the teaching profession, this specific date might be a detail that's not essential and could be a bit of a distraction. However, it's part of the narrative to show the young man's career progression. 

Overall, the text is coherent in its main message about teaching being a profession versus a job, but the transitions between examples and the structure of the narrative could be smoother. The flow is mostly logical, but some parts are a bit disjointed.
