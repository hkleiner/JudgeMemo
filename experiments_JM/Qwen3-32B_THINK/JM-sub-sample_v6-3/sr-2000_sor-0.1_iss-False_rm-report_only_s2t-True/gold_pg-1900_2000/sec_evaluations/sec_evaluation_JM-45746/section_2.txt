Let me analyze the current section to evaluate fluency and coherence.

## Fluency Analysis:

I'll look for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, word choice issues, and punctuation problems.

1. "The time is rapidly drawing to a close when mediocre preparation will be accepted in the field of education." - This sentence is a bit awkward in phrasing, but still understandable. It's a somewhat complex structure that could be simplified.

2. "One of the chief weaknesses of such teachers has usually been found to be in English." - This sentence is grammatically correct but could be more direct.

3. "In reading applications I have often noticed statements of this character given by one of the references..." - This sentence is a bit wordy and could be more direct.

4. "To do so means a narrowing of his viewpoint and the power of associating his special subject with the larger field of education." - The phrase "the power of associating" is a bit awkward.

5. "It is always well for an applicant to secure the permission of the people chosen as references before using their names." - This is grammatically correct but a bit wordy.

6. "When the motive is understood, he is in a better position to serve the applicant as well as the officials to whom the applicant has applied." - This sentence is grammatically correct but a bit complex.

Overall, the text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly disrupt readability.

## Coherence Analysis:

I'll look for logical sequencing, smooth transitions between ideas, clarity of progression, and overall organization.

1. The text jumps from discussing dress sense to preparation to application processes to a specific young man's motivation, then to a young woman's specialization. These transitions are somewhat abrupt.

2. The text mentions "a young man" and "a young woman" but doesn't clearly establish their relationship to the previous discussion about teaching qualifications.

3. The text seems to be a collection of different ideas about teaching qualifications without a clear unifying thread or logical progression.

4. The contrast between the young man and young woman is mentioned but not clearly explained in the context of the previous discussion.

5. The text discusses several different topics (dress, preparation, applications, motivation) without clearly connecting them to a central theme.

Overall, the text has some coherence but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections between ideas.

Based on my analysis:

For Fluency: I would rate this as a 4. The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues that don't significantly disrupt readability. The language is professional and well-structured, with only occasional awkward phrasing.

For Coherence: I would rate this as a 3. The text has some coherence but with noticeable abrupt shifts and unclear connections between ideas. The organization is somewhat disjointed, with the text jumping between different topics without clear transitions.
