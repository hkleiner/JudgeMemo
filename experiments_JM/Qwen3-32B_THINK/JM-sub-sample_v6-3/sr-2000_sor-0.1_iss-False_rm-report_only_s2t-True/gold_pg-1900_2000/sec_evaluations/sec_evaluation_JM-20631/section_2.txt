Okay, let's start by looking at the current section to evaluate. The user wants me to assess both fluency and coherence on a scale from 1 to 5, using half points if needed. 

First, for fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text is quite dense with historical and religious references. Let me scan through each sentence. 

I notice some sentences are a bit long and complex, which might affect readability. For example, "David, who is promised of God that his seed shall be enthroned for ever, slew surrendered Moabites in cold blood..." Here, the structure is correct, but the sentence is a bit clunky. Also, the phrase "promised of God" is a bit archaic; maybe "promised by God" would be more standard, but it's still grammatically acceptable. 

There are some instances where the syntax is a bit awkward. For example, "The prophet Isaiah pictures the wealth of nations--the phrase is his, not Adam Smith's--streaming to Zion by argosy and caravan." The use of em dashes here is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and the interruption might make it less fluent. 

Looking for spelling errors: I don't see any obvious misspellings. Words like "Maccabæus" with the æ ligature might be a stylistic choice rather than an error. Punctuation seems mostly correct, though some sentences could use commas for clarity. 

Now, for coherence. The text moves through different examples and quotes, connecting them to the theme of chosen people and vengeance. The flow is mostly logical, moving from biblical examples to modern interpretations. However, there are some jumps between ideas. For instance, after discussing Judas Maccabaeus, the text shifts to Isaiah's prophecy, then to the Psalms, and later to modern examples like the Englishwoman. These transitions are abrupt and might make the argument feel disjointed. 

Also, the mention of "CHAPTER: II" seems out of place and disrupts the flow. The section starts with a discussion of historical events and then transitions into mitigating factors, which is a logical progression but the shift from examples to analysis is handled smoothly. However, the examples from different time periods and contexts (ancient, medieval, modern) are presented without clear transitions, which might confuse the reader about how they connect to the main argument. 

In the latter part, when discussing the absurdity of judging the Bible outside its context, the text introduces quotes from Hinton and Maimonides. This part is a bit dense and the connection between the examples and the conclusion might not be immediately clear. The final sentence about Maimonides being confusing could be a coherence issue if the reader isn't following the argument closely.

Putting it all together for fluency: a few awkward phrasings and complex sentences, but no major errors. So maybe a 4. Coherence has some abrupt transitions and dense sections, but the overall structure is logical. So a 4 as well.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in long, complex sentences. - [LEXICON] Archaic or archaic-sounding word choice ("enthroned for ever," "slew surrendered"). - [PUNCTUATION] Overuse of em-dashes and parentheticals disrupting flow. - [STRUCTURE] Repetitive sentence structures in historical example listings.
2) Coherence Issues: - [LOGIC] Abrupt shifts between historical examples and modern comparisons. - [TRANSITION] Unclear connections between biblical citations and contemporary relevance. - [CLARITY] Dense academic tone makes thematic progression harder to follow. - [STRUCTURE] Sudden insertion of "CHAPTER: II" header disrupts narrative flow.
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
