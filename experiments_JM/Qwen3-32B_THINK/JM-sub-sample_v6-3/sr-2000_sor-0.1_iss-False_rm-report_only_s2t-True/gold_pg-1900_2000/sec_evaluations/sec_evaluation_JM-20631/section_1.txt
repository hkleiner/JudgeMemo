Okay, let's start by evaluating the fluency of the text. Fluency is about how smoothly the text reads, focusing on grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. 

First, I'll look for any grammatical errors. The text is quite old and formal, so some archaic structures might be present, but they shouldn't be errors. For example, the first sentence: "Mr. Arthur Davis, in whose memory has been founded the series of Lectures..." uses a passive construction which is correct. 

Next, checking for spelling. I don't notice any obvious misspellings. Words like "Hebraic," "prolific," "recondite," and "liturgy" are all spelled correctly. 

Looking at syntax and sentence structure. The sentences are generally well-structured, though some are quite long and complex. For example, the sentence starting "We see before our eyes Welsh and Irish..." is a long sentence but still clear. However, in the line "He was able to put his learning to good use. He observed the wise maxim of Leonardo da Vinci, 'Avoid studies of which the result dies with the worker.' He was not one of those learned men..." the structure is a bit repetitive and could be smoother, but it's not a major issue.

Word choice and phrasing seem appropriate for the formal tone. Phrases like "wisdom of Leonardo da Vinci" and "recondite subject" are correctly used. There are some idiomatic expressions like "put his learning to good use" which are clear.

Punctuation seems correct. Commas are used appropriately in lists and to separate clauses. The use of quotation marks around the quote from da Vinci is correct. The em dash in "Hebrew is one example among many of a language outliving for purposes of ritual its use in ordinary speech." might be better as a comma or a semicolon, but it's still understandable.

Now, checking for any awkward phrasing or redundancy. The phrase "He was not one of those learned men, of whom there are many examples--a recent and conspicuous instance was the late Lord Acton--whose minds are so choked..." uses an em dash which is correct, but the sentence is a bit long and could be clearer. However, it's still readable.

Overall, the text is very fluent. There are a few minor issues with sentence structure and punctuation, but they don't significantly impact readability. So, fluency score would be a 4 or maybe 4.5 if the issues are very minor.

Now moving on to coherence. Coherence is about the logical flow and structure of the text. The text is a foreword and the first chapter of a book, so it should present ideas in a logical order and maintain a clear progression.

The foreword introduces Arthur Davis and his contributions, then discusses the revival of Hebrew and other ritual languages, and ends with a call to action. The transition to Chapter I about the Jewish claim as a chosen people is a bit abrupt. The foreword ends with Herbert Samuel's name, and then Chapter I starts with a different topic. There's no clear transition between the two sections, which might confuse the reader.

Within the foreword, the flow is logical. It starts with Davis's background, his work, the legacy, and then moves to the broader context of Hebrew's revival and ritual languages. Each paragraph builds on the previous one. However, when discussing other examples like Roman temples and Church Slavonic, the text jumps between different examples without smooth transitions. This could make the argument a bit disjointed.

In Chapter I, the text starts with the claim about the Jews being a chosen people, then references historical figures and modern critics. The flow is logical here, moving from historical to modern examples. However, the mention of Germany and the quote from Von Tirpitz might not be as clearly connected to the main argument about Jewish election. The comparison to Germanism's doctrine is relevant, but the transition could be smoother.

There are some abrupt shifts in the text. For example, the foreword ends with Herbert Samuel's name, and the next chapter starts with the claim about the Jews irritating Gentiles. Without a transition, this could be confusing. Also, the use of quotes from different sources without clear signposting might disrupt the flow.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent, but there are a few places where transitions are missing or abrupt. The examples provided are relevant but could be better connected. The score would be a 3.5 or 4, depending on how noticeable these issues are.
