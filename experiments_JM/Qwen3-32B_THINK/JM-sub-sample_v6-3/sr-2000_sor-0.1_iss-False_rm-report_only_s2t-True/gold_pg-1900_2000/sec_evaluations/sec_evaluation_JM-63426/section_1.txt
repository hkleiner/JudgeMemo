Okay, I'm going to evaluate the provided text based on the criteria of Fluency and Coherence. Let me start by understanding what each of these metrics means according to the instructions.

For Fluency, I need to look at how the text reads sentence by sentence. I'll check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. If there are any awkward phrasings, errors in grammar or spelling, or if the sentences don't flow smoothly, those would be fluency issues.

For Coherence, I need to assess how well the ideas flow together as a whole. Is there a logical progression of ideas? Are there smooth transitions between paragraphs and sentences? Are there any abrupt shifts or confusing segments?

Let me now examine the text carefully.

Starting with Fluency:

1. I notice a few punctuation issues. For example, in the sentence "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free," there's a missing comma after "free" to separate the clauses properly.
2. There are some instances where the sentence structure could be clearer. For example, "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye." The phrase "stir in its sleep" is a bit awkward.
3. I see a few instances of potential word choice issues. For example, "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?" The use of "whose" here is slightly awkward and might be better as "whose hasn't anyone else had?" but the author's choice is still understandable.
4. There are some complex sentences that might be difficult to follow at times, but they don't significantly disrupt the flow.

For Coherence:

1. The text appears to be a biography of Will Bradley, and it flows chronologically from his early life to his career. The narrative is generally well-structured.
2. There are some transitions between paragraphs that could be smoother. For example, the shift from discussing Bradley's work in the 1890s to his early life in the next chapter could be more clearly indicated.
3. The second chapter, "The Boy Printer of Ishpeming," is a chronological account of Bradley's childhood, but the transitions between different time points (e.g., moving from Boston to Swampscott to Boston again) could be more clearly marked.
4. Overall, the text maintains a clear focus on Will Bradley's life and career, with each paragraph building on the previous one in a logical manner.

Now, let me evaluate each metric:

For Fluency:
- I found a few punctuation and sentence structure issues, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall readability.
- The text is generally well-written with clear, natural phrasing.
- The issues I found are relatively minor and don't distract from the overall message.

For Coherence:
- The text has a clear narrative structure with a logical progression of ideas.
- The transitions between paragraphs are mostly smooth, though there are a few places where the flow could be improved.
- The narrative is consistent and well-organized throughout.

Based on my assessment:

Fluency Score: 4.5
- The text is mostly fluent with only minor issues in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.
- The language flows naturally with clear phrasing.
- The few issues I found don't significantly impact readability.

Coherence Score: 4
- The text is generally coherent with a clear narrative structure.
- There are a few places where transitions could be smoother, but they don't significantly disrupt the overall coherence.
- The narrative is well-organized and maintains a consistent focus throughout.

Let me now formalize my findings in the requested format.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing comma after "free" in "He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free," 
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the American public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye."
- [WORD CHOICE] Slightly awkward use of "whose hasn’t" in "There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose hasn’t?"
- [STRUCTURE] Some complex sentences could be simplified for clarity

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt shift from discussing Bradley's impact to his childhood in the second chapter 
- [LOGIC] Sudden jumps between different time periods in the second chapter without clear markers 
- [STRUCTURE] Some chronological elements in the second chapter lack smooth transitions 
- [CLARITY] A few sentences reference events without sufficient context (e.g., "Your father is ill, an aftermath of the Civil War")

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
