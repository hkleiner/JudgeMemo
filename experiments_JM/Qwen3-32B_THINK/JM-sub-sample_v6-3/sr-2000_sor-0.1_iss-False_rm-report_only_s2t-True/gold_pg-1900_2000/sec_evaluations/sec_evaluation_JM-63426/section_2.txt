Okay, let's start evaluating this text for fluency and coherence. 

First, **fluency**. I need to check for grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. 

Looking at the first part: "Teacher says, “Take your books and go home, Willie, and remain until you have the correct answer.”" The sentence structure here is a bit awkward. The use of "and remain until" after "go home" feels a bit forced. Maybe a better phrasing could be "and remain there until," but as it is, it's not incorrect, just slightly clunky.

Next line: "You don’t like arithmetic, anyway." The placement of "anyway" at the end is a bit informal but acceptable in dialogue. No major issues here.

Then, "Your mother is troubled. Finally she says, “Perhaps it will be for the best.”" The shift from "Your mother" to "she" is clear, so that's fine. The sentence is straightforward.

Moving on to the part about the Iron Agitator and George A. Newett: "This is the George A." That seems like a fragment. It should probably be "This is the George A. Newett..." to make the sentence complete. That's a grammar issue.

Another part: "The two jobbers are kicked." The verb "kicked" is a bit unclear here. It might be a typo for "kicked out" or "kicked in," but without more context, it's hard to tell. This could be a syntax issue affecting clarity.

"Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside the window..." The structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe "You have half an hour of leisure and learn..." would be clearer. The original sentence uses a misplaced modifier, making it a syntax problem.

"Country newspaper shops train and use local help for straight matter." The term "straight matter" is a bit unclear. It might be a jargon term, but if the reader isn't familiar, it could be confusing. This is a lexicon issue.

"For job work, ads and presswork they depend upon itinerant job printers..." The repetition of "job" might be redundant. Also, "depend upon" could be simplified to "rely on." This is a minor syntax issue.

"When the Iron Ore job printer leaves you are sorry." The sentence is missing a comma after "leaves," making it a comma splice. It should be "When the Iron Ore job printer leaves, you are sorry." That's a punctuation issue.

"At this early date the print shop is above a saloon and in one corner of a big barn of a room that had been a lodge hall." The phrase "big barn of a room" is a bit awkward. Maybe "a large barn-like room" would be better. It's a syntax/lexicon issue.

"He offers you eight dollars a week. You are not that important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to begin saving after paying board and buying your clothes." The use of an em dash here is correct, but the sentence could be split for clarity. However, it's still understandable.

Other parts like "the acknowledged position of job printer" and "you go out on the street and employ off-shift miners to operate the press by means of a crank attached to the flywheel" are a bit wordy but grammatically correct. 

Now, checking for coherence. The text is a narrative of a young person's experiences in a print shop. The flow seems logical, moving through time and detailing different jobs and responsibilities. 

The transition from the initial problem of getting an art education to working at the newspaper is smooth. The events are in chronological order, which helps with coherence. 

However, there's a part where the text mentions "the George A." which is a fragment and might confuse the reader. Also, the mention of a faker selling soap with a guitar and kerosene flare at the end seems a bit out of place. It introduces a new event without clear connection to the previous narrative about the print shop. That could be a coherence issue due to an abrupt shift in context. 

Another point is the sudden jump to the editor’s sanctum and the scene with the faker. This part feels like a separate anecdote that's tacked on without much transition. It might disrupt the flow of the main narrative about the protagonist's work and growth in the print shop. 

The text also has a lot of specific details about the print shop setup and the protagonist's roles, which are well-integrated but could be overwhelming if not structured properly. However, they are presented in a chronological manner, which helps maintain coherence.

Overall, the text is mostly coherent with a logical progression. The main issues are the fragment in "This is the George A." and the abrupt shift to the faker scene at the end. These might cause minor confusion but don't completely disrupt the narrative.

For fluency, the main issues are the fragment, some awkward phrasing, and a few syntax problems. For coherence, the main issues are the abrupt shift and a minor fragment affecting flow. 

I would rate fluency as 4 because there are some minor issues but the text is generally clear and readable. Coherence is also a 4, as the narrative is mostly logical but has a couple of points where the flow is slightly disrupted.
