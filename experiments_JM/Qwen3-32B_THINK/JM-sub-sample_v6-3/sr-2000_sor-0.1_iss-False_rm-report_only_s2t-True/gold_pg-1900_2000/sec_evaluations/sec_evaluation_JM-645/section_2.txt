Alright, let me go through the text and look for any issues in fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. The text is quite long and has a lot of dialogue. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. 

First, I notice some commas that might be missing or misplaced. For example, in the sentence "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." The comma after "him" is correct, but the structure is a bit complex. 

Next, there's a part where it says "He’d take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress." The phrase "on going to dress" might be a bit awkward. Maybe "when going to dress" would be smoother. 

Then, "I did give her pleasure, I judged, but perhaps not quite so much as I had expected." The placement of "I judged" here is a bit jarring. It might read better as "I judged I did give her pleasure..." 

Looking at the dialogue: "Oh, it’s all right—the usual twaddle!” The em dash is used here, which is correct, but maybe a comma would be better for flow. Also, the sentence "He enquired, artless body, what he thought of Lady Jane’s 'panegyric'" has "artless body" which might be a typo or a misplaced modifier. Maybe it's supposed to be "artless as a body" or "artless, body"? The punctuation here is confusing. 

Another part: "Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth." "Half across the cloth" is a bit awkward. Maybe "halfway across the cloth" would be better. 

In the sentence "But a dish was at this point passed over his shoulder, and we had to wait while he helped himself." The passive voice might be a bit clunky. Active voice could make it clearer. 

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative with a lot of dialogue and character interactions. I need to check if the ideas are logically sequenced and if the transitions are smooth. 

The story starts with Lady Jane showing the article to others, then Vereker's reaction, and then the dinner scene. The flow seems okay, but there's a jump when the setting shifts from the earlier part to the dinner. However, since this is a current section, maybe the context is provided enough. 

In the dinner scene, the dialogue between Vereker and Miss Poyle is a bit confusing. The mention of "the usual twaddle" and the subsequent exchange might not clearly convey the intended meaning. The reader might need more context about why Vereker is being critical. 

The sentence "Miss Poyle’s surprise was a fortunate cover for my own." The transition here is a bit abrupt. It connects to the previous dialogue but the reason for the "fortunate cover" isn't clear without more context. 

There's also a part where the author mentions "the most extraordinary drops" referring to Lady Jane. This might be a bit vague without prior knowledge of her character. 

The ending dialogue between Miss Poyle and Vereker is a bit confusing. The phrase "Doesn’t see anything" might be a bit abrupt and not clearly tied to the previous context. 

Overall, the fluency has some minor issues with sentence structure and word choice, but nothing too distracting. Coherence is mostly there, but some parts could be smoother with better transitions and clearer dialogue.
