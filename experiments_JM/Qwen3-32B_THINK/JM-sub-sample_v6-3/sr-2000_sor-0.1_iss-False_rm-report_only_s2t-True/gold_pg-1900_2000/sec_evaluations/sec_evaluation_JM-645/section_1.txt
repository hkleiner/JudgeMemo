Alright, let me start by looking at the fluency and coherence of the provided text. 

First, for fluency, I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text is a chapter from a novel, so it's in a literary style. I'll scan through each sentence for any errors. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "I HAD done a few things and earned a few pence—I had perhaps even had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the patronising; but when I take the little measure of my course (a fidgety habit, for it’s none of the longest yet) I count my real start from the evening George Corvick, breathless and worried, came in to ask me a service." The sentence is quite long, but the structure is complex, which is common in literary prose. The use of em dashes and parentheses is correct. The word "patronising" is missing an apostrophe (should be "patronising"), but that might be a typo. The sentence is a bit convoluted but grammatically correct.

Next, "He had done more things than I, and earned more pence, though there were chances for cleverness I thought he sometimes missed." The structure is okay, but "pence" is repeated. Not a major issue. 

"I could only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for kindness." The placement of "however" is a bit awkward. Maybe "I could only, however, that evening declare..." would be smoother. 

"What explanation could be more to the point than my obvious fitness for the task?" The phrasing is a bit wordy but still clear. 

"I had written on Hugh Vereker, but never a word in _The Middle_, where my dealings were mainly with the ladies and the minor poets." The use of italics is correct for the periodical name. 

"This was his new novel, an advance copy, and whatever much or little it should do for his reputation I was clear on the spot as to what it should do for mine." The phrase "whatever much or little" is a bit awkward. Maybe "whether it did much or little" would be better. 

"Moreover if I always read him as soon as I could get hold of him I had a particular reason for wishing to read him now..." The structure is a bit long and the "if" clause is a bit confusing. 

"Corvick, who had promised a review of it, had not even had time to read it; he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiring—as on precipitate reflexion he judged—that he should catch the night-mail to Paris." The use of em dash is correct, but the sentence is very long. 

"He had had a telegram from Gwendolen Erme in answer to his letter offering to fly to her aid." The repetition of "had" is correct for past perfect tense. 

"I knew already about Gwendolen Erme; I had never seen her, but I had my ideas..." The structure is okay. 

"He appreciated my present eagerness and undertook that the periodical in question should do no less; then at the last, with his hand on the door, he said to me: “Of course you’ll be all right, you know.”" The dialogue punctuation is correct. 

"I wondered an instant. “The sense, pray, of want?”" The dialogue is properly enclosed in quotes. 

"I didn’t allude to the lot, however; I flattered myself that I emerged on this occasion from the infant of art." "Infant" should be "infancy." That's a spelling error. 

"“It’s all right,” they declared vividly at the office;" The adverb "vividly" is used with a verb that doesn't typically take an adverb. It should be "vividly declared." But that might be a style choice. 

Overall, there are a few minor issues like the missing apostrophe in "patronising" and the misspelling of "infant" instead of "infancy," but the rest seems to be grammatically correct and flows well. The sentences are complex but not confusing. So for fluency, maybe a 4.5 or 4.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative from a novel, so coherence would depend on logical progression, transitions, and clarity. 

The first chapter introduces the narrator's relationship with George Corvick and the setup of the story involving Hugh Vereker and Gwendolen Erme. The second chapter continues the narrative with the narrator's visit to Bridges and interactions with Vereker. 

The transition between chapters is smooth, and the narrative progresses logically. The introduction of characters and their motivations is clear. The narrator's internal thoughts and the interactions with other characters are well-connected. 

However, there's a bit of confusion in the first chapter when the narrator mentions "the infancy of art" and later corrects it to "infant of art," which should be "infancy." That might cause a slight hiccup in understanding. 

The dialogue and internal monologue are well-integrated, and the cause-effect relationships (e.g., Corvick needing the narrator to write the review) are clear. The second chapter continues the story without abrupt shifts. 

There's a mention of "The Middle," which is a periodical, and the context is clear from the narrative. The progression from the narrator writing the review to the visit to Bridges is logical. 

Overall, the text is coherent with a clear narrative flow. There are no major logical inconsistencies or abrupt transitions. So the coherence score would be a 4.5 or 5.

Putting it all together, the fluency has a few minor issues but is mostly fluent. Coherence is strong with logical progression. So final scores would be Fluency 4.5 and Coherence 4.5.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: - [GRAMMAR] "I could only however that evening declare..." (awkward clause structure) - [SPELLING] "the infant of art" (should be "infancy") - [SYNTAX] "whatever much or little it should do for his reputation" (awkward phrasing)
2) Coherence Issues: - [CLARITY] "the infancy of art" (ambiguous reference to artistic development) - [LOGIC] Sudden shift from Corvick's urgency to narrator's internal monologue about Vereker - [TRANSITION] "I didn’t allude to the lot, however..." (abrupt transition from previous paragraph)
3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4
