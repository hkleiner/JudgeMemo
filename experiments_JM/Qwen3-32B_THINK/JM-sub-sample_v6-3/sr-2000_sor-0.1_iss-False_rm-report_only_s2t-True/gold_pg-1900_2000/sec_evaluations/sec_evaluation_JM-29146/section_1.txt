Alright, let's start by evaluating the text for fluency and coherence. 

First, fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Scanning through the text, I notice some repeated letters in words like "ith" instead of "is", "alwayth" instead of "always", and "thith" instead of "this". These are spelling errors. There are also some awkward phrasings, like "You make joketh. Well, nevertheleth, you have no ship." The use of "joketh" and "nevertheleth" is archaic and might be intentional for the character's lisp, but it could still be considered a syntax issue. Also, some sentences are a bit run-on or could be split for clarity, but they aren't too disruptive.

Next, coherence. The story is about Jason Ramsey dealing with Irwadian authorities. The flow seems logical; each paragraph follows the previous one. There are some transitions between characters and settings, like moving from Ramsey to Chind Ramar, then to Englander. The context is clear, and the cause-effect relationships (like the planetarization of the Transfer Service) are explained. However, there's a jump when the Earthgirl leaves the Polaris, which might be a bit abrupt. Also, the shift to Sally Englander's line in the kitchen is a bit sudden, but since it's part of the dialogue, it might be acceptable. The overall structure is coherent, but there are a few places where the transitions could be smoother.

For fluency, the main issues are spelling and some syntax. The spelling errors are noticeable but not too frequent. For coherence, the main issue is the abrupt transition with the Earthgirl. 

Fluency score: The text has some spelling issues but is generally readable. I'd say a 4, as the errors are minor and don't hinder understanding much. 

Coherence score: The story flows well with a few minor transitions. I'd give it a 4.5, as it's mostly coherent with only slight hiccups.
