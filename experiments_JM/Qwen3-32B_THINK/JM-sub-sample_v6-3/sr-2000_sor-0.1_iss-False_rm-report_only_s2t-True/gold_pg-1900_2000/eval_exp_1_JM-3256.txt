Alright, let's analyze this evaluation report to determine the final scores for fluency and coherence.

First, let me look at the fluency scores and issues:

Section 01:
- Fluency: 5.0
- Issues: Complex sentences may be challenging to follow

Section 02:
- Fluency: 4.0
- Issues: 
  - Complex sentence structures may slightly hinder readability
  - Some archaic phrasing could confuse modern readers
  - Ellipses and em-dashes used liberally, occasionally disrupting flow

For fluency, the first section is perfect with no issues, while the second section has three issues. The main problems are complex sentences (which were also mentioned in section 1), archaic phrasing, and punctuation issues with ellipses and em-dashes. These are mostly minor issues that affect readability but don't make the text difficult to understand.

Now for coherence:

Section 01:
- Coherence: 4.5
- Issues: Sudden transition between library anecdote and bushman story

Section 02:
- Coherence: 4.5
- Issues:
  - Sudden shift from character dialogue to abstract literary critique without clear transition
  - Dense metaphors require reader effort to follow connections
  - Jump from French critic's quote to cathedral metaphor lacks explicit linkage

For coherence, both sections have 4.5 scores, with issues related to transitions and dense metaphors that require more reader effort. The main problems are the sudden shifts and the need for readers to work to understand connections between ideas.

Looking at the fluency scale:
- 5: Highly fluent with minimal issues
- 4: Mostly fluent with minor issues
- 3: Generally readable but with multiple issues
- 2: Frequent errors making comprehension difficult
- 1: Largely unintelligible

The text has some complex sentences and archaic phrasing, but these are minor issues rather than major problems. The punctuation issues with ellipses and em-dashes also don't appear to be severe. Overall, the text is mostly fluent with some minor readability concerns. I would rate this as a 4.0 for fluency.

For coherence:
- 5: Highly coherent with clear progression
- 4: Mostly coherent with a few weak parts
- 3: Generally coherent but with noticeable issues
- 2: Frequently inconsistent or disconnected
- 1: Largely incoherent

The text has some issues with transitions between ideas and sections, and the metaphors sometimes require more effort to follow. These are noticeable but don't make the text incoherent. The overall structure seems to be mostly coherent with a few weak transitions. I would rate this as a 4.0 for coherence as well.

So my final assessment is:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.0
