Let me analyze the evaluation report to determine the final fluency and coherence scores for the text.

For fluency:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.5 with issues in syntax (awkward phrasing), lexicon (uncommon term), and punctuation (excessive em-dashes, inconsistent quotation marks).
- Section 02 has a score of 4.5 with a syntax issue (comma splice).

Across both sections, the fluency issues are mostly minor:
- Some awkward phrasing
- One uncommon term without explanation
- Issues with punctuation (em-dashes and quotation marks)
- One comma splice

These issues are relatively minor and don't significantly disrupt readability. Both sections maintain high fluency scores (4.5). I would rate the overall fluency as 4.5 since the issues are mostly minor and consistent across both sections.

For coherence:
- Section 01 has a score of 4.5 with issues in transitions (sudden shifts), logic (timeline inconsistency), clarity (confusing references), and structure (disconnected tracking scene).
- Section 02 has a score of 4.5 with a logic issue (abrupt shift at the end).

The coherence issues include:
- Sudden shifts between topics
- Timeline inconsistencies
- Confusing references
- Disconnected scenes

These are more significant than the fluency issues as they affect the logical flow and reader's understanding. However, the issues are still relatively minor and don't completely disrupt the overall coherence. Both sections maintain high coherence scores (4.5). I would rate the overall coherence as 4.5 as well.

Based on my analysis, I'll provide the final scores:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5

Evaluation Form:
1) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.5
2) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
