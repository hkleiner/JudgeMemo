Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Complex sentence structures may slightly hinder readability (e.g., long sentences with multiple clauses).
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Some archaic phrasing ("it gives one bookman whom I know the keenest pleasure") could confuse modern readers.
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Ellipses and em-dashes used liberally, occasionally disrupting flow.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from character dialogue to abstract literary critique without clear transition.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Dense metaphors (e.g., books as houses/cathedrals) require reader effort to follow connections.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Jump from French critic's quote to cathedral metaphor lacks explicit linkage.
