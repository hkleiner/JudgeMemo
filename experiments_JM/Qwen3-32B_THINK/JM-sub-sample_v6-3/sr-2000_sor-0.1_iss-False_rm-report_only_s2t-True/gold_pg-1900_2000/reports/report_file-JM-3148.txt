Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Inconsistent use of em-dashes and parentheses in dialogue (e.g., "‘One of Pag-pag’"—“Pag-a-ni-ni’s”).
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in fragmented dialogue (e.g., "dis-as-ter-ous triumphs he had when playing at Lord Holland’s").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Uncommon or archaic phrasing ("nunky," "doleful problems") that may disrupt readability.
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Abrupt transition from present-day dialogue to backstory of Anthony Croft without clear narrative framing.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Disjointed shift from Davy’s description of the sunset to the violin’s backstory.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous reference to "nunky" (unexplained term).

Section section_02 (Chars 8003–11543):
Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.0
  - Coherence: 4.5
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "The teacher had sometimes a brief season of apathy" (archaic/awkward word order).
        • Long, complex sentences (e.g., "He was one incarnate Why and How...") may strain readability.
    - [LEXICON]:
        • "dark close, sultry spot" (ambiguous phrasing; "close" could mean "enclosed" or "near").
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Missing commas in compound sentences (e.g., "He could also fashion an interesting musical instrument in his desk by means of spools and catgut and bits of broken glass").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Sudden shift from Anthony’s school behavior to his mother’s perspective ("His mother, who owned him...") lacks smooth connection.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "the triangle of black elastic in the teacher’s ‘congress’ shoe" (vague reference to an object).
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Jump from Anthony’s philosophical musings to his mother’s doubts about his "useless information" feels abrupt.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Repetition of "Why" questions dilutes narrative momentum.
