Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • "The advance was begun" (passive voice weakens clarity)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Inconsistent date formatting in battle list (e.g., "MAY 5-7, 1864" vs. "JUNE 1864-APRIL 1865")
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Ambiguous phrasing: "upper arm of the movement" (unclear metaphor)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • "straining war effort" (awkward word order)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt shift from "PROLOGUE" to "UNION STRATEGY 1864" without bridging context
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Unclear explanation of "upper arm" (confuses reader about strategic focus)
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden transition from Army of the James to Battle of the Wilderness (lacks linkage)
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Quote from Grant placed after battle details (contextual timing mismatch)

Scores:
  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "Along these roads passed supply wagons..." (passive voice disrupts flow).
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Slightly convoluted sentence structure in "Capt. Charles H. Dimmock... became unofficially known as the 'Dimmock Line.'"
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Minor abruptness in "It was the railroads more than the highways, however, which gave to Petersburg..." (placement of "however" disrupts flow).
  Coherence Issues:
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Sudden shift from defense line construction to raids without explicit connection.
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Jarring transition between historical context and the "Battle of Petersburg" chapter introduction.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous reference to "the very length and size of the fortifications" (unclear antecedent).
