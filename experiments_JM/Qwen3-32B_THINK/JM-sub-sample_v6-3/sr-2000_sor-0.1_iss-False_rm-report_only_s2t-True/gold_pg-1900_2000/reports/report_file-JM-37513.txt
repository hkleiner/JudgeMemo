Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Awkward phrasing in "to the authority that appealed to my fancy, and to a new loyalty, I was a willing slave" (choppy structure).
        • Overly complex sentences in later paragraphs (e.g., "the decomposition of every expended force into several forces has been perpetually producing...").
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Ambiguous use of "raw recruit" (context unclear).
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • Overuse of em dashes and quotation marks without consistent formatting.
    - [SPELLING]:
        • Minor typo in "animalcular" (should be "animalcule").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from personal anecdote to abstract philosophical concepts without clear transitions.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Jump between Tyndall's ideas, the friend's critique, and Spencer's work lacks explicit linking.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Dense exposition of Spencer's theories in the final paragraphs risks overwhelming the reader.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Abrupt transition from "ancillary generalizations" to Darwin and James's quotes.
    - [COHESION]:
        • Repetition of "differentiation" and "evolution" without reinforcing their interconnectedness.
