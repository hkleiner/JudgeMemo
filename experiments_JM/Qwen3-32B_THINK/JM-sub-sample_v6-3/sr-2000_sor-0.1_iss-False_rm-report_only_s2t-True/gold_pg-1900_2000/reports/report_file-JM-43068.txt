Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [GRAMMAR]:
        • "an exhaustive research into his life and works have revealed" (subject-verb agreement error)
    - [PUNCTUATION]:
        • "A long interval elapsed betwixt... Millet, unbroken by a single name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter..." (awkward comma usage creating confusion) - [WORD CHOICE] "whilst living the humblest lives themselves" (archaic phrasing with "whilst")
        • "firstly, by...; and, secondly, by..." (misuse of semicolon in enumeration)
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from historical analysis to specific artwork examples without clear transitional markers
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Jump between 17th-century Dutch art and 19th-century French peasant life lacks explicit connection
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Dense academic phrasing in "The entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality..." paragraph may confuse readers

  - Fluency: 4.5
  - Coherence: 4.0
Issues:
  Fluency Issues:
    - [SYNTAX]:
        • Overly complex sentence structures in some paragraphs (e.g., long sentences with multiple clauses).
    - [LEXICON]:
        • Slightly archaic phrasing ("he is dead to the beauties...") that may feel outdated.
    - [TRANSITION]:
        • Minor awkward phrasing in transitions between ideas ("But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad composition...").
  Coherence Issues:
    - [STRUCTURE]:
        • Sudden shift from analyzing "La Baigneuse" to discussing Millet’s philosophical nature without clear bridging.
    - [LOGIC]:
        • Weak connection between the detailed description of "The Sheep Pen" and the broader thesis about Millet’s art.
    - [CLARITY]:
        • Ambiguous reference to "the man at his work and his wife and children in the ménage" without explicit context.
