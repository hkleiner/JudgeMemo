Okay, let's start by looking at the current section the user provided. The task is to evaluate fluency and coherence, so I need to check for any issues in those areas.

First, fluency. I'll scan through the text for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. The text is quite detailed and seems to be a descriptive passage about the Yögurs' customs. I notice some parts where the sentences are long and might be a bit complex, but I don't see obvious grammatical errors. However, there are a few instances where the phrasing is a bit awkward. For example, in the sentence "The young people now proceed to the common tent where they kneel before the altar, after which the bridegroom alone kneels before his parents and the elder guests who give him small presents." The structure here is a bit convoluted, making it a bit hard to follow. Also, "Weights, measures and money are Chinese." is a very short sentence that might be better connected to the previous one for smoother flow.

Another part is "The Sarö Yögurs gave me the impression of being much sharper than the generality of Mongolians, Kalmucks and Tanguts. It is easier to make them understand you -- they are livelier, imagine they understand you before you say more than a few words and interrupt you with an answer before you have explained what you want." The use of a dash here is okay, but the sentence is a bit long and could be split for better clarity. Also, "The Ta fumu had an exceptionally good ear for foreign languages, and when I asked the names of numbers of things, through my interpreter, he amused himself repeating the Russian words he had heard me use." The placement of "through my interpreter" in the middle of the sentence is a bit disruptive. 

There's also a part that says "Weapons, bought from are knives Sinin articles and metal other." This sentence seems to have a syntax issue. The correct order should be "Weapons, bought from Sinin, are knives and other metal articles." The original sentence is confusing and doesn't make sense as written. That's a clear fluency issue. 

Looking at coherence, the text is a detailed description of various aspects of the Yögurs' life—wedding customs, family structure, physical characteristics, language, and so on. The flow from one topic to another is generally logical, but there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after discussing the physical appearance and then moving to the costume, there's a jump to the domestic appliances and implements. The transition from the description of their clothing to the mention of their tools and weapons is a bit sudden. Also, the section about their language and the Ta fumu's ability to mimic Russian words is followed by a paragraph about their mathematical skills and then their clothing again. This might create a slight disjointedness. 

Another point is the mention of "The people were dirty, but it is questionable if one would not also become so if one was forced as they are to spend the cold and stormy winter in their uncomfortable tents." This is a bit of a shift from the previous topic about their language and math skills to their hygiene and living conditions. While it's a relevant topic, the transition is abrupt and could be smoother. 

The section on their food at the end is very brief and seems a bit out of place compared to the detailed descriptions of other topics. It's just a sentence stating that their food is similar to other nomadic people, which feels like a summary or conclusion, but it's not clearly connected to the preceding paragraphs about their tools and clothing.

In terms of coherence, the text does maintain a general structure moving from one aspect of their culture to another, but some transitions between paragraphs are not as smooth as they could be. There are also some sections where the information is presented in a way that might confuse the reader about the connection between ideas. For example, the part about the Ta fumu and his language abilities is followed by a paragraph about their math skills and then their clothing, which might not be the most logical flow.

Considering all these points, I would rate the fluency as a 4. There are some minor issues with sentence structure and a few awkward phrasings, but the text is generally clear and readable. The major issue is the confusing sentence about weapons, which is a significant problem. For coherence, I'd give a 3.5. The text is mostly coherent, but there are some abrupt transitions and sections that could be better connected to maintain a smooth flow.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "Weapons, bought from are knives Sinin articles and metal other." (Confusing and ungrammatical sentence structure)
- [SYNTAX] "The Ta fumu had an exceptionally good ear for foreign languages, and when I asked the names of numbers of things, through my interpreter, he amused himself repeating the Russian words he had heard me use." (Disruptive placement of "through my interpreter")
- [SYNTAX] "The young people now proceed to the common tent where they kneel before the altar, after which the bridegroom alone kneels before his parents and the elder guests who give him small presents." (Cumbersome phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "The Sarö Yögurs gave me the impression of being much sharper... they are livelier, imagine they understand you before you say more than a few words and interrupt you with an answer before you have explained what you want." (Awkward parallel structure)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden jump from description of physical characteristics to detailed costume description without clear transition
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shift from language/communication section to mathematical abilities and then back to clothing
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed transition from hygiene/dirtiness to food habits at the end
- [LOGIC] Unclear connection between Ta fumu's language abilities and subsequent discussion of mathematical skills

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3.5
