Okay, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the current section based on the provided criteria. 

Starting with fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Let me read through the current section carefully.

First, I notice a few spelling errors. For example, "nonsenseYou thinking 're." should probably be "nonsense you're thinking." Also, "You Yes?" and "ever you that, am, slow consider about sir" seem like they're missing words or have incorrect word order. There's a line that says "youimplosion Irwadian any you I--U-235 me-- the Now assignment be or important with on me." That's a jumble of words with no clear structure. 

Looking at syntax and grammar, there are run-on sentences and fragments. For instance, "That think something to Margot gave about." The structure here is awkward and doesn't make sense. Also, "But could there be?" is a fragment. 

In terms of word choice, "You'll a need fuel supply" should be "You'll need a fuel supply." The phrase "scintillation-counter" is hyphenated but maybe should be "scintillation counter" without the hyphen. 

Now for coherence. The section has a mix of dialogue and narrative. The transition between Ramsey's thoughts and the introduction of Security Officer Chind is a bit abrupt. The shift from the characters on the ship to the security officer and then back to Vardin in the airlock might be confusing for some readers. 

The dialogue between Chind and Symm is mostly coherent, but the last part where Symm says "You Yes?" and Chind responds with a garbled sentence is unclear. It's possible that there's a formatting issue here, making it hard to follow the conversation. 

The ending with Vardin finding the fuel and the Enterprise being ready for hyper-space seems to connect logically, but the mention of "X" and the earlier parts about the proto-man letter might not be fully explained here, which could leave some confusion. 

Overall, there are several fluency issues that disrupt the reading experience, and some coherence problems where the flow between sections is not smooth. I'll need to list these issues under the appropriate labels and assign scores based on the criteria provided.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "nonsenseYou" (missing space and apostrophe)  
- [GRAMMAR] "That think something to Margot gave about" (fragmented, ungrammatical structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "youimplosion Irwadian any you I--U-235 me-- the Now assignment be or important with on me" (incoherent phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "You Yes?" (fragmented dialogue)  
- [GRAMMAR] "ever you that, am, slow consider about sir" (illogical word order)  
- [SYNTAX] "Ramsey the are, Vegan Earthman Vardin, with The both her" (awkward and incorrect phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transition from Ramsey/Margot/Vardin to Security Officer Chind without contextual linkage  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift to "Security Officer Second Class Ramar Chind" and unrelated subplot introduces disjointedness  
- [CLARITY] Unclear connection between "X" and the proto-man letter, leaving critical context unresolved  
- [TRANSITION] Disjointed shift from Chind/Symm dialogue to Vardin's actions in the airlock without narrative bridge  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
