Okay, let's start evaluating the current section based on fluency and coherence. 

First, for fluency, I need to look at grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation. The text has a lot of fragmented sentences and some parts that are hard to parse. For example, the line "And let down his mental guard." is very short and seems disconnected. Then there's a part that looks like gibberish: "... going I proto precise-place there thinks father her stop ... space she in-man ... meant 'mhyper 's to home have, mustof crazy ... heck, I'm no mystic..." This is probably a typo or formatting error, but it's very confusing. There are also some awkward phrasings like "He trained been as 've a scientist." which is grammatically incorrect. Also, "Youtrained been as 've a scientist." is a jumbled sentence. The use of ellipses and broken sentences might be intentional for effect, but they do affect fluency. There's also a part where the sentence structure is off: "There wasn't any time to measure extension with in hyper-space, since time doesn't exist here..." which is a run-on. The quotes and dialogue tags are mostly correct, but the overall flow is disrupted by these issues.

Moving to coherence, the main concern is the logical progression and how ideas connect. The text is part of a story where characters are in hyper-space dealing with a conflict. The transition from the previous context to this section seems abrupt. The gibberish part in the beginning might be a problem for coherence as it's unclear what's being conveyed. The dialogue between Ramsey and Margot is coherent, but the sudden shift to Garr Symm's thoughts and then back to Ramsey and Margot might be jarring. The ending part where Vardin is involved has some confusion in the sentence structure: "looked girl mutely at Vegan The Ramsey." This is a misplaced modifier, making it unclear who is looking at whom. The overall narrative is trying to build tension and explain the hyper-space concept, but some parts are confusing due to the fragmented sentences and unclear transitions. The idea of time not existing in hyper-space is a key point, but the explanation is sometimes muddled by the fluency issues.

For fluency score, the text has several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but the main issue is the gibberish section. That would be a significant problem. The rest of the text is mostly readable but with some stumbles. So maybe a 2.5? But considering the gibberish is a major issue, maybe lower. However, some parts are clear. Let's say 2.5.

For coherence, the main issues are the abrupt transitions and the unclear parts like the gibberish and the misplaced modifier. The story's logic is there, but the flow is disrupted. Maybe a 3.5? Because the narrative is mostly coherent despite some problems.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [SYNTAX] "And let down his mental guard." (fragmented sentence)
- [SPELLING] "... going I proto precise-place there thinks father her stop ... space she in-man ..." (gibberish/typo)
- [GRAMMAR] "He trained been as 've a scientist." (jumbled phrasing)
- [SYNTAX] "There isn't any time to measure extension with in hyper-space..." (awkward word order)
- [SPELLING] "'mhyper 's to home have, mustof crazy" (unintelligible text)
- [SYNTAX] "Youtrained been as 've a scientist." (incorrect verb forms)
- [SYNTAX] "looked girl mutely at Vegan The Ramsey." (misplaced modifier)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from Ramsey/Margot dialogue to Garr Symm's monologue without clear transition
- [LOGIC] Inconsistent explanation of hyper-space physics (time vs. space measurements)
- [CLARITY] Unresolved contradiction between lethal m.g. gun and timelessness in hyper-space
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt return to Ramsey/Margot after Garr Symm's thoughts
- [CLARITY] Confusing reference to "Vardin" at end without clear subject identification

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
