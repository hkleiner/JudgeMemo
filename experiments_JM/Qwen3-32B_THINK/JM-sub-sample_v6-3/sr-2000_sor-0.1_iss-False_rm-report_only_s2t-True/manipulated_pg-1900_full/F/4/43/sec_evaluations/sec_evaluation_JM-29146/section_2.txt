Okay, let's start evaluating the given text for fluency and coherence. 

First, looking at fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. 

I notice some spelling errors. For example, "thoaked off 's hand bedRamsey" – that seems incorrect. The correct phrase might be "shook off Ramsey's hand". Then there's "bedRamsey" which is a typo. Also, "he had only three credits left. If he risked them now..." – the sentence structure is a bit awkward but not too bad.

Another part: "He red was a, of-set and heavy hair short with a skin, Sirian shock, albino eyes scarlet." This is confusing. It should probably be "He was a red, short-haired, heavy-set man with a shock of Sirian hair, albino eyes, and a scarlet..." Maybe? The original has a lot of run-on phrases and incorrect word order here.

Then "Evidently or liquor trouble not hold, looking could he or for his, was both." This is a jumbled sentence. It should be something like "Evidently, his liquor trouble was not holding, and he could look for his..." but the original is a mess.

In the part about the Vegan girl: "unitreserved humanoid outworlders 'd halls with her a-the-for he dance in danced even." This is very unclear. It might be trying to say "united reserved humanoid outworlders had danced with her even..." but it's written incorrectly.

Now for coherence. The text is a narrative, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and if the transitions are smooth. 

The story moves from Ramsey giving money to Englander, then Ramsey going to gamble, meeting the Irwadian, and the conflict. The transition from the gambling scene to the encounter with the Irwadian seems okay, but some parts are abrupt. 

The part where Ramsey is insulted by the Irwadian and the subsequent conflict is clear, but the dialogue and some descriptions are confusing due to the fluency issues mentioned earlier. The mention of "Garr Symm" and his role as Security Police is introduced, but the flow is interrupted by the awkward sentences.

Also, the last paragraph about Earth's role is a bit disjointed. The sentences are long and the ideas don't connect as smoothly as they could. 

Overall, the fluency issues are significant with multiple spelling and grammatical errors, which affect readability. The coherence is somewhat affected by these fluency problems and some abrupt transitions, but the main narrative is still understandable despite the issues.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SPELLING] "thoaked off 's hand bedRamsey" (likely "shook off Ramsey's hand")  
- [SYNTAX] "He red was a, of-set and heavy hair short with a skin, Sirian shock, albino eyes scarlet" (jumbled word order)  
- [GRAMMAR] "Evidently or liquor trouble not hold, looking could he or for his, was both" (incoherent structure)  
- [LEXICON] "unitreserved humanoid outworlders 'd halls with her a-the-for he dance in danced even" (nonsensical phrasing)  
- [SPELLING] "thertainly wath" (likely "certainly was")  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Abrupt transition from Ramsey’s gambling to the Irwadian’s aggressive dialogue without clear setup  
- [CLARITY] Confusing references to "Garr Symm" and his role in the narrative (introduced mid-conflict without prior context)  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed ending with Earth’s geopolitical role, abruptly shifting from personal conflict to broader themes  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of smooth connection between Ramsey’s internal thoughts and external actions (e.g., "Hitting the sack" to the Irwadian landlady reference)  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
