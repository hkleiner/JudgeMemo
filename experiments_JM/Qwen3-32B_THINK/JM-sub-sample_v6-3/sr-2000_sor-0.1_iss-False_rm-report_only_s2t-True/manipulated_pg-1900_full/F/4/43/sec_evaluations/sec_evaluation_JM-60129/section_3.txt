Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The user provided a text about the Sarö Yögurs, focusing on their customs, marriage practices, and some statistics. I need to assess both fluency and coherence.

Starting with fluency. I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice issues. The first thing that stands out is the sentence: "In read called cases, death lama upon to a is of prayers." That's a jumbled mess. It seems like a mistranslation or typo. Then, "The by either been which agreed paid or for girl at once is upon price has the instalments." Another run-on sentence with incorrect structure. There's also "the contrarys" which should be "contrary." Other examples include "the water this week is in butter washed is repeated a," which is confusing. These are clear fluency issues. There are several more instances of awkward phrasing and incorrect grammar throughout, like "the hair is cut or shaved later. Before the birth of the child, the lama reads prayers over the mother, but he takes no notice of the newly born." The structure here is a bit off. Also, the table at the end has numbers and labels that are poorly formatted and hard to read. So, fluency is definitely an issue with multiple grammatical errors and awkward sentences.

Now, coherence. The text is about customs and practices, but the flow is a bit choppy. The section on death rituals is followed by marriage customs, which is logical, but then there's a jump to statistics without a smooth transition. The statistics part is presented as a table, which is confusing in the middle of narrative text. The table's format is unclear, making it hard to follow. Also, the mention of "the Sarö Yögur language" and the substitution of Chinese words is in the middle of discussing marriage, which is a bit jarring. The final paragraph about statistics and their possible falsification is a bit abrupt. The overall structure moves from one topic to another without clear transitions, leading to some confusion. However, the main ideas are there and connected, but the abrupt shifts and the table in the middle disrupt the flow. So coherence is affected by these structural issues and lack of smooth transitions.

For fluency, the text has multiple grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and confusing sentences. It's a 2 because there are frequent issues that make reading difficult. Coherence is a 3 because while the main ideas are connected, there are noticeable abrupt shifts and the table disrupts the narrative flow.
