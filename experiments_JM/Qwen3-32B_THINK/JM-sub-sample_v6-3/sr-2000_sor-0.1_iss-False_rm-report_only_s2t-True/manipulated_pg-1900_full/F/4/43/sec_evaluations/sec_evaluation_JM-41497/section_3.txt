Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

First, let's look at FLUENCY issues:

1) There are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in the text. For example:
- "His the 's omitted down scene and of pause the of been now hurried have have."
- "a: some"
- "rather and 1769 year come likely more advantage to, with achievements strife recall been unintentional to diplomatic We is tofrom Joshua than CHAPTER Sir experiences absence II have that from may survey."
- "middle crack fade, when mostof is painter darken Sir of, period the roughly critic Joshua: "works 's, early 'strenchant he Armstrong latter, his the day justified late pictures Speaking, writes Sir Walter his maturity those."

2) There are instances of word choice errors and misspellings:
- "Shakspere" (should be "Shakespeare")
- "Incorporated Society was left to linger for a few years in the cold shades of opposition"
- "Antiquary" (while technically correct, it seems out of context)
- "Grafton Gallery to-day" (archaic phrasing)

3) The text contains fragmented sentences and incomplete thoughts:
- "a: some"
- "rather and 1769 year come likely more advantage to, with achievements strife recall been unintentional to diplomatic We is tofrom Joshua than CHAPTER Sir experiences absence II have that from may survey."
- "middle crack fade, when mostof is painter darken Sir of, period the roughly critic Joshua: "works 's, early 'strenchant he Armstrong latter, his the day justified late pictures Speaking, writes Sir Walter his maturity those."

4) The text has strange punctuation and formatting:
- "His the 's omitted down scene and of pause the of been now hurried have have."
- "a: some"
- "middle crack fade, when mostof is painter darken Sir of, period the roughly critic Joshua: "works 's, early 'strenchant he Armstrong latter, his the day justified late pictures Speaking, writes Sir Walter his maturity those."

Now let me look at COHERENCE issues:

1) The text has abrupt shifts in narrative and confusing transitions:
- The narrative moves from discussing Reynolds' career and relationships to strange, disjointed sentences.
- There are sudden shifts in perspective and time that are not clearly connected.
- The text jumps from discussing Reynolds' painting techniques to his personal life to his deafness to his relationships with Angelica Kaufmann.

2) There are logical inconsistencies and confusing segments:
- The text references "The Club" but doesn't clearly define it or its purpose.
- The narrative about Reynolds' deafness and the "old house in Leicester Square" is abruptly cut off.
- The discussion of Reynolds' relationship with Angelica Kaufmann is confusing and seems to jump between different time periods.

3) The text contains unresolved references and unclear connections:
- There are references to "The Club" and "The Society of Arts" without clear explanation.
- The narrative about Reynolds' travels with Dr. Johnson is cut off.
- The text mentions "Leslie and Taylor in their voluminous work" but doesn't clearly explain what they wrote about.

4) The text has segments that seem to be incomplete or cut off:
- The sentence "His the 's omitted down scene and of pause the of been now hurried have have." appears to be a fragment of some other text.
- The sentence "a: some" seems like a misplaced note or fragment.
- The sentence "middle crack fade, when mostof is painter darken Sir of, period the roughly critic Joshua: "works 's, early 'strenchant he Armstrong latter, his the day justified late pictures Speaking, writes Sir Walter his maturity those." appears to be a jumbled fragment.

Now let me assign scores:

For FLUENCY: The text has numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and fragmented sentences. While some parts are readable, the overall fluency is significantly impaired by these issues. I would give a score of 2 out of 5.

For COHERENCE: The text has significant coherence issues with abrupt shifts, logical inconsistencies, and unresolved references. While some parts are coherent, the overall narrative is difficult to follow. I would give a score of 2 out of 5.
