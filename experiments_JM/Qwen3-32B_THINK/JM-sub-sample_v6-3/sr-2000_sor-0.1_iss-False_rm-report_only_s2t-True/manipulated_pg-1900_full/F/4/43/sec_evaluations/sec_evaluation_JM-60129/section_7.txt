Okay, let's start by looking at the current section the user provided. The task is to evaluate it for fluency and coherence using the given criteria. 

First, I need to check for fluency issues. Fluency is about grammar, syntax, spelling, word choice, and punctuation. I'll go through the text and look for any errors.

Looking at the first paragraph: "According to a statement made by the Chinese mandarin in Li-yen..." The term "mandarin" is correct, but I notice "a kind ol Governor General" – "ol" should be "of". That's a spelling mistake. Also, "t'idu" and "t'umus" are used, which might be transliterations, but the apostrophe placement is inconsistent. Maybe that's intentional, but it could be a typo. 

Next, "six tshi Huang-fan from the district of Urumtchi." The word "tshi" is used, but I'm not sure if that's correct. It might be a transliteration of a term, but the spelling could be an issue. Also, "tshi Huang-fan" – is that plural? The structure here might be awkward. 

In the next part: "This movement is supposed to have taken place during Yungch'eng's reign." The apostrophe in "Yungch'eng's" is correct. Then, "The Sarö and Shera Yögurs are the remnant of these six tshi..." The use of "tshi" again. Maybe it's a specific term, but the repetition without explanation could be confusing. 

Moving to the section about the tribe's population: "Death, and also the amalgamation with the Chinese element, has greatly diminished the tribe..." The subject "Death" and "amalgamation" are both singular, but the verb "has" is singular. However, the structure here is a bit awkward. Maybe a comma splice issue. 

In the marriage customs section: "Marriage with the Chinese does not occur any longer, neither with the Tanguts, though it did occur earlier." The use of "neither" here is correct, but the structure is a bit complex. The sentence could be clearer. 

Looking at the list of "bones": The formatting is a bit odd with the numbers and the use of semicolons and commas. For example, "Tokshu 5; Orgé 20; Sultus 8-9;..." It's a list, but the punctuation isn't consistent. Also, some entries have Chinese and Yögur names, but the alignment is not clear. 

In the administrative division section: The Chinese names and Yögur names are listed in columns, but the formatting is confusing. For example, "Chinese     Yögur                          Chinese            Yögur" – the spacing is inconsistent, making it hard to read. 

In the funeral customs part: "If such the read called to, upon is is not lama a more case prayers." This sentence is very confusing. It seems like there's a grammatical error here. The structure is broken, and the words don't form a coherent sentence. 

Another part: "The ashes are kneaded into a burkhan (an image of Buddha), which placed inside a wooden box, is buried." The placement of "which" is incorrect. It should be "which is placed..." 

In the inheritance section: "Only male descendants inherit. -- The widow remains with her son or sons..." The use of "--" is inconsistent with the rest of the text. It's a dash, but maybe it should be a period or a colon. 

In the marriage customs: "The family only of a daughter does not marry." This sentence is confusing. It might be trying to say that the daughter's family doesn't marry into the family, but the structure is unclear. 

There are also some instances where the use of "tshi" is repeated without clear explanation, which might be a transliteration issue but could be a problem for fluency if it's a typo. 

Now, for coherence. The text is a detailed ethnographic description, so the structure should be logical. The flow from one topic to another (tribe history, population, administrative divisions, customs) seems organized, but there are some abrupt shifts. 

For example, after discussing the administrative divisions, the text jumps to funeral customs, then inheritance, then marriage customs. Each section is separate, but the transitions between them are not smooth. 

The list of "bones" and administrative divisions are presented without clear transitions. The reader might need to infer the connection between the sections. 

In the funeral customs section, the sentence about the body being eaten by vultures is followed by a confusing sentence about the lama and prayers. The connection between the two isn't clear. 

The use of terms like "t'umus" and "t'idu" without prior explanation could be confusing for someone unfamiliar with the context. Since this is an excerpt, the lack of context might affect coherence. 

The administrative division section has a table-like format, but the formatting is inconsistent, which could disrupt the flow. 

In the marriage customs section, the description of the wedding process is detailed but some parts are repetitive or have abrupt shifts in focus. 

Overall, the text is informative but has some issues with clarity and flow, which could affect coherence. The detailed nature of the content might require more transitional phrases to guide the reader smoothly through the different topics.
