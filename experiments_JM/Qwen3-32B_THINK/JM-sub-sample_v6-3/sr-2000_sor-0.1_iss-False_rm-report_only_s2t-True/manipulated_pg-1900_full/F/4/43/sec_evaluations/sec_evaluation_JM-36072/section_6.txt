Alright, let me analyze this text for fluency and coherence. Starting with fluency, I'll look for grammar, spelling, syntax, and punctuation issues.

First sentence: "Real Darwin with the scientific Huxley returned against, calmly shown interest was, ignored which and leaders hatred." This sentence is a jumbled mess. It seems like fragments are thrown together without proper structure. Grammatical errors are abundant here. The subject and verbs don't align. 

Next, "Later to of back the a became the there-the, a less promising was generation set seemed great short years in of fiction few reign when for and than and new writers, charm in several they ability next be English fortunes appeared." This is another incoherent sentence. The words are out of order, making it impossible to parse. There's no clear subject or verb. 

Other sentences have issues too. For example, "The palmiest day of English novel-writing was in the fifties, when Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Kingsley, Disraeli, Bulwer Lytton and Meredith were all writing." The list is long and could be clearer with commas or semicolons. 

Looking at coherence, the text jumps around topics. It starts with Darwin and Huxley, then moves to Victorian literature, then to the decline of English fiction, social changes, and ends with a reflection on the future. There's little transition between these topics. Some sections reference previous ideas without clear connections. For instance, the shift from discussing the decline of English fiction to the fusion of social classes feels abrupt. 

There's also a lack of clear progression. The author introduces multiple points without resolving them. For example, the mention of the Boer War as the beginning of the downfall of certain movements isn't elaborated on. The text seems to present a series of observations without a unifying thread. 

Some parts are repetitive or contradictory. The author praises Victorian literature and then criticizes the age for its vulgarization due to industrialization. These points could be connected more clearly. 

The conclusion jumps from the future of English civilization to America's role without a smooth transition. The overall structure feels disjointed, making it hard to follow the author's argument. 

In terms of coherence, the text lacks logical sequencing. Ideas are introduced and then dropped. For example, the mention of "parasitism at both ends of the scale" isn't followed up on in a way that connects to the rest of the discussion. 

Overall, the text has significant fluency issues in several sentences and coherence issues due to abrupt shifts and lack of transitions. The author's points are not well-organized, making it difficult to follow the argument.

1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "Real Darwin with the scientific Huxley returned against, calmly shown interest was, ignored which and leaders hatred." (Fragmented syntax, incoherent structure)  
- [SYNTAX] "Later to of back the a became the there-the, a less promising was generation set seemed great short years in of fiction few reign when for and than and new writers, charm in several they ability next be English fortunes appeared." (Ungrammatical word order, nonsensical phrasing)  
- [PUNCTUATION] Missing or misplaced commas in long lists (e.g., "Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Kingsley, Disraeli, Bulwer Lytton and Meredith")  
- [GRAMMAR] "There is no time to speak at length of the Victorian novel... and we shall be wise to stick to it, instead of preferring a corrupt following of the French..." (Awkward phrasing, unclear pronoun reference)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt shifts between topics (e.g., from Darwin/Huxley to Victorian literature, then to social class fusion, then to industrialization's effects)  
- [TRANSITION] Lack of logical connectors between paragraphs (e.g., transition from discussing "parasitism at both ends of the scale" to "Legislation removed most of the obvious evils...")  
- [CLARITY] Vague or unresolved references (e.g., "the worst that can be said of it is that it encouraged a temper of sentimental brutalism...")  
- [LOGIC] Contradictory claims without resolution (e.g., praising Victorian literature while criticizing its "vulgarization" due to industrialization)
