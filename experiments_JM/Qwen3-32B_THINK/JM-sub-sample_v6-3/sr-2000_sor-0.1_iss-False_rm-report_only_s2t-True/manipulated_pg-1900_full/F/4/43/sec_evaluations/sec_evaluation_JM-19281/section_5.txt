Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the current section provided. The user wants me to assess the fluency and coherence of this text. The previous section is context, so I should ignore it for the evaluation. 

Starting with Fluency. The text is quite dense with religious and philosophical content. I'll check for grammar, spelling, syntax, and word choice. The first part of the current section has a line: "of Himself that hour the Ere known hath of the of the unto Manifestation", which seems like a jumble of words. That's a clear syntax issue. Then there's "men man" which is probably a typo. The sentence structure here is confusing, making it hard to follow. Later, there's a part with "Until enrich anthropological historical such commonplace of, were evolution generations..." which is fragmented and lacks proper punctuation. These are fluency problems.

Looking further, there are some awkward phrasings like "the ongoing fact the revelation a trial one, were that in method of prescribed in Divinedifference the integrity norms..." which is a run-on sentence with unclear meaning. The use of phrases like "the code itself would lose none of its authority during the long stage of human progress in which it played a vital role in training behaviour and attitudes." is correct grammatically but a bit convoluted. However, there are also some well-structured sentences, so the fluency isn't all bad. But the presence of multiple errors and awkward phrasing would lower the score.

Now for Coherence. The text discusses the Bahá'í concept of progressive revelation and addresses objections to the unity of religions. The structure seems logical, moving from the objection to explaining the evolutionary context, then discussing practices and doctrines, followed by theological presumption. However, there are some abrupt transitions. For example, after discussing cultural expressions, the text jumps into the evolutionary process of religious life without a smooth transition. Also, the long quotes from Bahá'u'lláh are integrated but sometimes disrupt the flow. The mention of the Qur'án and Jesus' parable are relevant but could be better connected to the previous points. The conclusion about dogmatic theology and Bahá'u'lláh's warnings is clear, but the middle sections have some disjointed parts. The overall argument is coherent, but some sections could be more smoothly connected.

In the Fluency Issues, the main problems are the jumbled sentences, spelling errors, and awkward phrasing. For Coherence, the abrupt transitions and some disconnected ideas are the main issues. Considering the scales, Fluency might be a 3 because there are multiple issues that disrupt the flow, but the text is generally readable. Coherence is a bit higher, maybe a 3.5, as the overall argument holds together but with some noticeable jumps.

Evaluation Form:  
1) Fluency Issues:  
- [SYNTAX] "of Himself that hour the Ere known hath of the of the unto Manifestation" (incoherent sentence structure)  
- [SPELLING] "men man" (likely typo or missing word)  
- [SYNTAX] "Until enrich anthropological historical such commonplace of, were evolution generations..." (fragmented, non-sequitur phrasing)  
- [SYNTAX] "the ongoing fact the revelation a trial one, were that in method of prescribed in Divinedifference..." (run-on sentence with unclear meaning)  
- [LEXICON] "the code itself would lose none of its authority during the long stage of human progress in which it played a vital role in training behaviour and attitudes." (awkward phrasing)  

2) Coherence Issues:  
- [LOGIC] Sudden shift from "cultural expressions" to "evolutionary process of religious life" without transitional explanation  
- [STRUCTURE] Disjointed integration of quotes from Bahá'u'lláh and the Qur'án with surrounding argumentation  
- [CLARITY] Ambiguous connection between "theological presumption" and "Jesus' parable of the landowner"  
- [TRANSITION] Abrupt transition from "dogmatic theology" to "reincarnation, pantheistic prodigies" without contextual linkage  
- [LOGIC] Unclear progression from "progressive revelation" to "Bahá'u'lláh's warnings about dogmatic theology"  

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5  
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 3
