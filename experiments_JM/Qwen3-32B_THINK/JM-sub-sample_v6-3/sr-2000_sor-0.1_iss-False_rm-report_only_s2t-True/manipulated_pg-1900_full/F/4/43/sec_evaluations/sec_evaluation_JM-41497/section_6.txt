Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to look at the current section provided and assess both fluency and coherence. 

Starting with fluency. I'll read through the text and check for any grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, spelling mistakes, or issues with syntax. 

Looking at the first paragraph: "The Strawberry Girl" is another picture painted in hours of delightful inspiration, but "The Age of Innocence," for all its supreme beauty, has a certain quality of conception that is artificial." The sentence structure here is a bit complex but seems okay. The use of commas and quotation marks is correct. 

Next part: "To look at Reynolds' women and children is to feel assured that the painter lived a celibate life..." The verb agreement here is correct. 

Then: "We have but to turn to the work of his great contemporaries, Gainsborough and Romney..." The phrasing is a bit old-fashioned but still grammatically sound. 

Moving on to the second paragraph: "The picture of Admiral Keppel, hanging to-day in the National Portrait Gallery, was the first ripe fruit of the painter's Italian journey, and had produced in the world of art something akin to a sensation." The phrase "had produced" might be a tense issue. Since the painting was created after the journey, maybe "produced" without "had" would be better, but it's still understandable. 

In the third paragraph: "He seemed to see right into the heart and brain of the men who sat for him, to realise clearly and judiciously the part they were playing in life..." "Realise" is spelled with an 's', which is British English, but since the text seems to be in British English, that's acceptable. 

The sentence "Other painters might give one aspect of a man, but Reynolds' vision was far larger--it was completely comprehensive;" uses an em dash correctly. 

In the fourth paragraph: "To satisfy the claims of Reynolds' brush it was absolutely necessary that his sitters should have character, even if it was a bad one." The phrasing is a bit archaic but still clear. 

The next part: "That is why the portraits of courtesans arouse attention in fashion that women whose characters were undeveloped either for good or for evil will never succeed in doing." The phrase "in fashion that" seems off. Maybe "in a way that" would be better, but the current phrasing is awkward. 

Moving to the fifth paragraph: "It is not always easy to realise what Reynolds' work was like at its best, because so many of his canvases have either lost their original tints or have suffered the final indignity of restoration." The use of "realise" again with an 's' is correct in British English. 

The sentence "His solid foundations decomposed, the surface colour of many a celebrity is now as pale as the sitter's own ghost may be supposed to be." The shift from past tense "decomposed" to present "is now" might be jarring. 

The final paragraph: "And yet when criticism has said its last word, the name and fame of Sir Joshua Reynolds will remain the pride of British art and the admiration of the civilised world." The phrasing is a bit poetic but grammatically correct. 

Overall, the fluency seems mostly good. There are a few awkward phrases and some old-fashioned terms, but nothing that severely disrupts the reading. So I might rate fluency as a 4.5, maybe 4 if there are more issues I'm missing.

Now for coherence. The text discusses Reynolds' work, comparing his portraits of women and children to his male subjects, and talks about the lasting impact of his work. The flow is logical, moving from one point to the next. Each paragraph builds on the previous one, discussing different aspects of Reynolds' art. 

However, there's a transition from discussing the courtesans to the issue of color preservation. The connection between these two topics isn't immediately clear. The sentence about color might be a bit abrupt. Also, the mention of "solid foundations decomposed" is a bit confusing in context. 

The overall structure is coherent, but there are a couple of points where the transitions could be smoother. Maybe a 4 for coherence, with a minor deduction for those transitions.

Evaluation Form:
1) Fluency Issues: 
- [GRAMMAR] "have suffered the final indignity of restoration" (subject-verb agreement issue)
- [SYNTAX] Awkward phrasing in "in fashion that women whose characters..." (unclear construction)
- [LEXICON] "solid foundations decomposed" (metaphorical language with unclear reference)

2) Coherence Issues: 
- [STRUCTURE] Sudden shift from discussing courtesans to color preservation without clear transition
- [LOGIC] Jump between Reynolds' artistic approach and the degradation of his paintings lacks explicit connection
- [CLARITY] Unclear reference to "solid foundations" in the context of paint degradation

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 4.0
4) FINAL Fluency Score: 4.5
