Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues.

# Fluency Issues

Looking at the text, I can identify several fluency problems:

1. [SPELLING] "ith" instead of "is"
2. [SPELLING] "thith" instead of "this"
3. [SPELLING] "thurrender" instead of "surrender"
4. [SPELLING] "ecth-captain" instead of "ex-captain"
5. [SPELLING] "ecthra-planetarieth" instead of "extra-planetaries"
6. [SPELLING] "ecthra-planetarieth" instead of "extra-planetaries"
7. [SPELLING] "ethpect" instead of "expect"
8. [SPELLING] "thupport" instead of "self-support"
9. [SPELLING] "thith" instead of "this"
10. [SPELLING] "Thervith" instead of "Service"
11. [SPELLING] "Tranthfer" instead of "Transfer"
12. [SPELLING] "planetarithed" instead of "planetarized"
13. [SPELLING] "Ramthe" instead of "Ramsey"
14. [GRAMMAR] "He space from transferring Irwadians technical a difficult the through in was space move," - this sentence is completely incoherent and ungrammatical
15. [GRAMMAR] "also again been years the he that space a had to for normal-and but hyper knew knew theory starship tremendously normal many contemplating back task." - this sentence is also completely incoherent and ungrammatical
16. [SPELLING] "Ramar" instead of "Ramar" (this appears to be a consistent name, not a spelling error)
17. [SPELLING] "imagine which scene had at planet today on fifty no being here his all duplicated, this native fifty business could outworld on on ships ships Irwadi." - this sentence is incoherent and ungrammatical
18. [SPELLING] "Ramsey, she thought. She had read Chind Ramar's mind" - the "she" refers to the Earthgirl who is thinking, but the text is confusing

# Coherence Issues

Now, looking at the coherence of the text:

1. [LOGIC] The text jumps between different locations and characters without clear transitions. We move from Ramsey to Chind Ramar to the Earthgirl to Englander and his wife in a disjointed way.
2. [LOGIC] The Earthgirl's sudden ability to read minds is introduced without explanation or context.
3. [LOGIC] The conversation between Ramsey and Englander at the end seems to occur in a different location and time than the previous parts of the text without clear transition.
4. [LOGIC] The text references "the Polaris" and the "New Quarter" without providing context for readers who don't have the full story.
5. [LOGIC] The Earthgirl's internal monologue appears in the middle of the narrative without clear transition.
6. [LOGIC] The text shifts from describing events on the spacefield to Chind Ramar's internal thoughts to the Earthgirl's perspective to Ramsey and Englander's conversation in a disjointed way.

# Final Scoring

For Fluency:
The text contains numerous spelling errors and several completely incoherent sentences. These issues would significantly interfere with readability. While some parts of the text are coherent, the frequency and severity of the issues would make the text difficult to read and understand.

I would rate the fluency as a 2.5. It has frequent grammatical errors and incoherent sentences that make comprehension difficult in places, but it's not completely unreadable.

For Coherence:
The text has noticeable abrupt shifts and disconnected ideas. The narrative jumps between different characters and locations without clear transitions, and some plot elements are introduced without context. While there is a basic storyline, the lack of clear transitions and the disjointed nature of the narrative would make it difficult to follow.

I would rate the coherence as a 3. It's generally coherent but contains noticeable abrupt shifts and confusing segments that affect the reading experience.

Let me summarize my findings in the required format.
