Okay, let's start evaluating this text. The task is to rate it on fluency and coherence using the provided criteria.

First, looking at fluency. I need to check for grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, and punctuation. Let me go through the text sentence by sentence.

In the line "Millions of of, normal the colonists them worlds for space." There's a repetition of "of" and the phrase is fragmented. That's a syntax and word order issue. Also, "normal the colonists them worlds for space" doesn't make sense. It should probably be "millions of normal colonists for the worlds in space." So that's a major fluency problem.

Another part: "The neck on rose his hackles." The phrase "neck on rose his hackles" is awkward. It should be "his hackles rose on his neck." That's a syntax error. 

Then there's "Earth Ramseygo back n't said ca," I to. This seems like a typo or a misplaced sentence. It's unclear what's being said here. The words are jumbled, so it's a spelling and syntax issue.

Now for coherence. The text is a science fiction story, so I need to check if the ideas flow logically and transitions are smooth. 

The section starts with the Irwadi dying, then shifts to Ramsey's internal thoughts and dialogue. The transition between Ramsey chasing Margot and the sudden appearance of Vardin's voice is abrupt. It might be okay in context, but here it's a bit jarring. 

The dialogue between Ramsey and Vardin is dense with exposition. It's a lot of information about matter-transmission and their ancestors. Some parts are confusing, like "We colonized the worlds, deciding that physical existence, along with the mental prowess we had, was the ideal state." The connection between these ideas isn't always clear, leading to some confusion.

The ending part where Vardin disappears and the Enterprise blasts off is a bit rushed. The transition from the black box to the Enterprise taking off is abrupt. Also, the last line "Earth Ramseygo back n't said ca," I to." is unclear and disrupts the flow.

There are also some plot points that might not be fully explained in this excerpt, like the significance of the black box and the transformation of Garr Symm. Without the full context, some elements might feel disconnected.

Putting it all together, the fluency issues are mainly in the problematic sentences with syntax and word choice. The coherence issues are more about the logical flow and some abrupt transitions. I'll need to assign scores based on the criteria provided.
