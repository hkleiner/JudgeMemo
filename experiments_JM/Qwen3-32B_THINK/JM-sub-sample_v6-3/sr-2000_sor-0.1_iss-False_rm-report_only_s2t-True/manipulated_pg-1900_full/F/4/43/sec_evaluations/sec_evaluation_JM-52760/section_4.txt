Let me analyze the text for fluency and coherence issues according to the given criteria.

# Fluency Analysis

I'll look for issues with grammar, spelling, syntax, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation:

1. "There reasons failure strike any many, one their being were the this to for tunnels Union of construction." - This sentence is incoherent and appears to be a jumbled mess of words with no clear meaning or grammatical structure.
2. "Burnside man and the pressed a IX fresh 4,300, Corps on division by, wishes-attack wanted Negro, his spearheaded his to lead Meade." - This sentence is also incoherent and appears to be a jumbled mess of words with no clear meaning or grammatical structure.
3. "By action effort the Confederates prompt and had determined a prevented breakthrough." - This sentence has awkward phrasing and unclear meaning.

These issues suggest a score in the lower range for fluency.

# Coherence Analysis

I'll look for issues with logical sequencing, smooth connections between ideas, clear progression, and consistency:

1. The narrative jumps abruptly from the description of the tunnel to the military preparations and then to the explosion and battle. There are few transitional phrases to connect these different segments.
2. The text sometimes references events or people without sufficient context (e.g., "Pleasants" is mentioned without introduction).
3. The battle description has some confusing elements, particularly in the later parts where the movements of different units are described with limited clarity about their relationships and positions.
4. The text ends abruptly with "The last scene in the battle occurred shortly after 1 p.m. Mahone had called up a third brigade, and an attack spearheaded by the fresh unit succeeded in gaining the slopes of the crater," without concluding the overall narrative.

Based on these observations, I would rate the coherence as mid-range.

Now I'll summarize my findings in the required format:

1) Fluency Issues:
- [GRAMMAR] "There reasons failure strike any many, one their being were the this to for tunnels Union of construction."
- [GRAMMAR] "Burnside man and the pressed a IX fresh 4,300, Corps on division by, wishes-attack wanted Negro, his spearheaded his to lead Meade."
- [CLARITY] "By action effort the Confederates prompt and had determined a prevented breakthrough."

2) Coherence Issues:
- [STRUCTURE] Abrupt transitions between different segments of the text (tunnel description to military preparations to battle).
- [CONTEXT] References to people and events without sufficient introduction (e.g., "Pleasants").
- [LOGIC] Confusing description of battle movements and unit positions in the later parts of the text.
- [CLARITY] Sudden ending without concluding the overall narrative.

3) FINAL Coherence Score: 3.5

4) FINAL Fluency Score: 2.5
