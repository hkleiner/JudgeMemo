I would like to perform automatic evaluation on quality of written stories.
I would like to evaluate them in terms of fluency and coherence.

Here are several fine-grained aspects for each metric:

### Fluency Evaluation Aspects:
1. **Syntax and Grammar**: How well-constructed are the sentences in terms of grammatical correctness?
2. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Are there any noticeable errors in spelling or punctuation that disrupt the flow?
3. **Word Choice**: Is the vocabulary appropriate for the context, and does it contribute to a smooth reading experience?
4. **Phrasing**: Are the phrases well-structured, or are they awkwardly worded?
5. **Flow**: Does the text flow smoothly from one sentence to the next, or are there abrupt transitions?

### Coherence Evaluation Aspects:
1. **Logical Sequencing**: Are the ideas presented in a logical order?
2. **Non-repetitiveness**: Is the text free from unnecessary repetition, or does it repeat information without adding new insights?
3. **Smooth Connections**: Are the transitions between sections or ideas smooth, or are they abrupt?
4. **Ambiguity Avoidance**: Does the text avoid ambiguity, or are there parts that are unclear?
5. **Structural Consistency**: Is the narrative or argument structured in a consistent and clear manner?

For each metric, highlight the main issues in short and concise bulletpoints, naming the affected aspect. Based on this, rate the text from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
Return the final scores (1 to 5) in new lines starting with each aspect as following:
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE]
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE]

The story text is given below:
Story: {Story}

Assess the quality of the text regarding fluency and coherence. Afterwards, return the final scores (1 to 5) in new lines starting with each metric as following:
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE]
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE]
