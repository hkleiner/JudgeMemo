Imagine you are a human annotator now. You will evaluate the quality of a given written story. Please follow these steps:
1. Carefully read the story, and be aware of the information it contains.
2. Rate the story on two dimensions: fluency, and coherence.
You should rate on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
Definitions are as follows:
Fluency: This rating measures the quality of individual sentences, whether they are well-written and grammatically correct.
Consider the quality of individual sentences.
Coherence: The rating measures the quality of all sentences collectively. The text should be well-structured and well-organized,
it should build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the text. Consider the quality of the text as a whole.
Explain the quality of the text briefly in a few lines (100-200 tokens) regarding fluency and coherence. Afterwards,
return the final scores (1 to 5) in new lines starting with each aspect as following:
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE]
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE]
