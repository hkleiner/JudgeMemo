You will be given a human-written story. Your task is to rate the story according to the
evaluation criterion on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions
carefully.

Task Type Description:
1. Name problems in the text that lead to a point deduction. Use bullet points only. Label each issue with a category that describes the issue best, e.g. for fluency: [GRAMMAR], [SPELLING], [SYNTAX], [LEXICON], or for coherence: [LOGIC], [STRUCTURE], [CLARITY], [TRANSITION]. You are free to use other labels as well.
2. After describing the issues, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5 for each metric. You should refer to the requested metrics.
3. The output format should look as follows:
"Issues: (name short bullet points) [LABEL]
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)"
4. Do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.

Evaluation Criterion:
- Fluency: Fluency assesses how the text reads from start to finish. It mainly focuses on syntax, grammar, spelling, word choice, phrasing, and punctuation of individual sentences. It ensures that the language flows smoothly without awkward phrasing or errors.
- Coherence: Coherence assesses how the story unfolds as a whole. Important criteria are logically sequenced, non-repetitive and smoothly connected ideas, a clear progression from one section to another, avoidance of ambiguities and abrupt jumps, and how consistent and clear structured the narrative is.

The story text is given below:
Story: {Story}

Evaluation Form:
Issues: (write a feedback for criteria)
FINAL Coherence Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)
FINAL Fluency Score: [SCORE] (an integer number between 1 and 5)
