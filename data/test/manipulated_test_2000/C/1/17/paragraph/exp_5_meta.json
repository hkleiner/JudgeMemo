                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\n\nFOR the discovery of Dickens\u2019s secret in _Edwin Drood_ it is necessary to\nobtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their relations\nto each other.\n\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a\ncathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud,\nwho had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers\u2014somewhere.  They\nwere \u201cfast friends and old college companions.\u201d  Both married young.  Mr.\nBud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child, a\ndaughter, Rosa Bud.  Mr. Drood, whose wife\u2019s maiden name was Jasper, had\none son, Edwin Drood.  Mrs. Bud was drowned in a boating accident, when\nher daughter, Rosa, was a child.  Mr. Drood, already a widower, and the\nbereaved Mr. Bud \u201cbetrothed\u201d the two children, Rosa and Edwin, and then\nexpired, when the orphans were about seven and eleven years old.  The\nguardian of Rosa was a lawyer, Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with\nher mother.  To Grewgious Mr. Bud entrusted his wife\u2019s engagement ring,\nrubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to hand over to Edwin Drood, if,\nwhen he attained his majority, he and Rosa decided to marry.\n\nGrewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while Edwin\u2019s maternal\nuncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died), was\nEdwin\u2019s \u201ctrustee,\u201d as well as his uncle and devoted friend.  Rosa\u2019s\nlittle fortune was an annuity producing \u00a3250 a-year: Edwin succeeded to\nhis father\u2019s share in an engineering firm.\n\nWhen the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to proceed\nto Egypt, as an engineer.  Rosa, at school in Cloisterham, is about\nseventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.  He is conductor of the Choir of\nthe Cathedral, a \u201clay precentor;\u201d he is very dark, with thick black\nwhiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of\nopium smoking.  He began very early.  He takes this drug both in his\nlodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London,\nkept by a woman nicknamed \u201cThe Princess Puffer.\u201d  This hag, we learn, has\nbeen a determined drunkard,\u2014\u201cI drank heaven\u2019s-hard,\u201d\u2014for sixteen years\n_before_ she took to opium.  If she has been dealing in opium for ten\nyears (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable\nfor twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper\u2019s birth.  Mr. Cuming\nWalters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore,\nmaternal grandmother of Edwin Drood.  She detests her client, Jasper, and\nplays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.\n\nJasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the _fianc\u00e9e_ of his nephew, and\nhis own pupil in the musical art.  He makes her aware of his passion,\nsilently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions\nprivate.  She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on\nuncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love\nher, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their\nbetrothal.  \u201cThe bloom is off the plum\u201d of their prearranged loves, he\nsays to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed\npassion for Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.  Rosa is\naware of this fact; \u201ca glaze comes over his eyes,\u201d sometimes, she says,\n\u201cand he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream, in which he\nthreatens most . . . \u201d  The man appears to have these frightful dreams\neven when he is not under opium.\n\n\nOPENING OF THE TALE\n\n\nThe tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of\nCloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the\nPrincess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself.  This\nCathedral tower, thus early and emphatically introduced, is to play a\ngreat but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain.\nJasper, waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the\nLascar and Chinaman in their sleep.  He pronounces it \u201cunintelligible,\u201d\nwhich satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must be\nunintelligible also.  He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of\nthe eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he\nhope to understand the sleepers?  He is being watched by the hag, who\nhates him.\n\nJasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a\nnonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the\npink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow.  Jasper\ngives Edwin a dinner, and gushes over \u201chis bright boy,\u201d a lively lad,\nfull of chaff, but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of\nheart.  Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he\nloathes his life; and that the church singing \u201coften sounds to me quite\ndevilish,\u201d\u2014and no wonder.  After this dinner, Jasper has a \u201cweird\nseizure;\u201d \u201ca strange film comes over Jasper\u2019s eyes,\u201d he \u201clooks\nfrightfully ill,\u201d becomes rigid, and admits that he \u201chas been taking\nopium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.\u201d  This \u201cagony,\u201d\nwe learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin speak lightly of his love, whom\nJasper so furiously desires.  \u201cTake it as a warning,\u201d Jasper says, but\nEdwin, puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not understand.\n\nIn the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and has\na tiff with Edwin.  Sir Luke Fildes\u2019s illustration shows Edwin as \u201ca lad\nwith the bloom of a lass,\u201d with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head\nof long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been\ncut.  He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period.\n\n\nSAPSEA AND DURDLES\n\n\nNext, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at\ntheir wine, expecting a third guest.  Mr. Sapsea reads his absurd epitaph\nfor his late wife, who is buried in a \u201cMonument,\u201d a vault of some sort in\nthe Cathedral churchyard.

                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw among the company was Mr. Julius Slinkton.  There he was, standing\nbefore the fire, with good large eyes and an open expression of face; but\nstill (I thought) requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way\nhe offered, and by no other.\n\nI noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to Mr. Sampson, and my\nfriend did so.  Mr. Slinkton was very happy to see me.  Not too happy;\nthere was no over-doing of the matter; happy in a thoroughly well-bred,\nperfectly unmeaning way.\n\n\u2018I thought you had met,\u2019 our host observed.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton.  \u2018I did look in at Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, on your\nrecommendation; but I really did not feel justified in troubling Mr.\nSampson himself, on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary\nclerk.\u2019\n\nI said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend\u2019s\nintroduction.\n\n\u2018I am sure of that,\u2019 said he, \u2018and am much obliged.  At another time,\nperhaps, I may be less delicate.  Only, however, if I have real business;\nfor I know, Mr. Sampson, how precious business time is, and what a vast\nnumber of impertinent people there are in the world.\u2019\n\nI acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow.  \u2018You were thinking,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018of effecting a policy on your life.\u2019\n\n\u2018O dear no!  I am afraid I am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment\nof supposing me to be, Mr. Sampson.  I merely inquired for a friend.  But\nyou know what friends are in such matters.  Nothing may ever come of it.\nI have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries\nfor friends, knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the\nfriends will never follow them up.  People are so fickle, so selfish, so\ninconsiderate.  Don\u2019t you, in your business, find them so every day, Mr.\nSampson?\u2019\n\nI was going to give a qualified answer; but he turned his smooth, white\nparting on me with its \u2018Straight up here, if you please!\u2019 and I answered\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I hear, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he resumed presently, for our friend had a new\ncook, and dinner was not so punctual as usual, \u2018that your profession has\nrecently suffered a great loss.\u2019\n\n\u2018In money?\u2019 said I.\n\nHe laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, \u2018No,\nin talent and vigour.\u2019\n\nNot at once following out his allusion, I considered for a moment.\n\u2018_Has_ it sustained a loss of that kind?\u2019 said I.  \u2018I was not aware of\nit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understand me, Mr. Sampson.  I don\u2019t imagine that you have retired.  It\nis not so bad as that.  But Mr. Meltham\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018O, to be sure!\u2019 said I.  \u2018Yes!  Mr. Meltham, the young actuary of the\n\u201cInestimable.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Just so,\u2019 he returned in a consoling way.\n\n\u2018He is a great loss.  He was at once the most profound, the most\noriginal, and the most energetic man I have ever known connected with\nLife Assurance.\u2019\n\nI spoke strongly; for I had a high esteem and admiration for Meltham; and\nmy gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he\nwanted to sneer at him.  He recalled me to my guard by presenting that\ntrim pathway up his head, with its internal \u2018Not on the grass, if you\nplease\u2014the gravel.\u2019\n\n\u2018You knew him, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\n\u2018Only by reputation.  To have known him as an acquaintance or as a\nfriend, is an honour I should have sought if he had remained in society,\nthough I might never have had the good fortune to attain it, being a man\nof far inferior mark.  He was scarcely above thirty, I suppose?\u2019\n\n\u2018About thirty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 he sighed in his former consoling way.  \u2018What creatures we are!  To\nbreak up, Mr. Sampson, and become incapable of business at that time of\nlife!\u2014Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?\u2019\n\n(\u2018Humph!\u2019 thought I, as I looked at him.  \u2018But I WON\u2019T go up the track,\nand I WILL go on the grass.\u2019)\n\n\u2018What reason have you heard assigned, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked,\npoint-blank.\n\n\u2018Most likely a false one.  You know what Rumour is, Mr. Sampson.  I never\nrepeat what I hear; it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving\nthe head of Rumour.  But when _you_ ask me what reason I have heard\nassigned for Mr. Meltham\u2019s passing away from among men, it is another\nthing.  I am not gratifying idle gossip then.  I was told, Mr. Sampson,\nthat Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his\nprospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted.  A disappointed\nattachment I heard,\u2014though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man\nso distinguished and so attractive.\u2019\n\n\u2018Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018O, she died?  Pray pardon me.  I did not hear that.  That, indeed, makes\nit very, very sad.  Poor Mr. Meltham!  She died?  Ah, dear me!\nLamentable, lamentable!\u2019\n\nI still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an\nunaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted,\nlike the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:\n\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man\nwhom I have never known.  I am not so disinterested as you may suppose.\nI have suffered, and recently too, from death myself.  I have lost one of\ntwo charming nieces, who were my constant companions.  She died\nyoung\u2014barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from\nstrong.  The world is a grave!\u2019\n\nHe said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of\nmy manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by\nmy bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how\nmuch I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had\ngained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I\ntroubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled\nmyself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and\nobserved how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful\ninstinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he\ntalked with.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n       ",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771).",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole.

Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?\n\nNow, whatever men may think of the doctrine of inspiration, all must\nadmit as an historical fact, that when St. Paul wrote these words, the\nwhole of the Old Testament was included in the Jewish canon.  The Jews,\nnotwithstanding all their faults, were admirable guardians of Scripture,\nand there was no doubt in the mind of any pious Jew as to what books\ntogether formed his Bible.  He was much clearer on that subject than many\nof our modern writers.  When therefore St. Paul spoke of \u2018All Scripture,\u2019\nthere is no doubt in the world that he included in his statement every\nline and letter of the Old Testament, and he taught us in those words\nthat the whole, from first to last, from the first of Genesis to the last\nof Malachi was given by inspiration of God.\n\nIn saying this, I make no exception whatever with reference to the\nhistorical books.  I think it has been clearly shown that those\nhistorical writings which are not in the Pentateuch are included in that\npart of Scripture called the Prophets.  In which case the language of St.\nPeter, already quoted, refers to history as well as prediction.  Nay,\nmore!  I do not hesitate to say, that if I were called upon to prove\ninspiration, there is no portion of the whole volume on which I should be\nbetter pleased to meet an opponent than the historical portions of the\nOld Testament.  So strong is the argument in their favour, that although\nby so saying I may startle some, I am prepared, after the most careful\ndeliberation, to affirm that I cannot separate them from the word of God\nwithout at the same time abandoning the whole of my Christianity.  My\nreason for this statement is, that our Lord Himself in His own teaching\nhas most distinctly sanctioned them.  Men cavil at the strange miracles\nrecorded in them, but, while men cavil, He refers to no less than nine of\nthese miracles as facts.  The flood, the destruction of Sodom and\nGomorrah, the death of Lot\u2019s wife, the burning bush, the manna, the\nbrazen serpent, the cure of Naaman, the preservation of the widow of\nSarepta, and the rescue of Jonah, are all endorsed by His divine\nauthority.  To the books of Moses, which are chiefly historical, He\nperpetually refers as to the word of God, describing their testimony as\nmore worthy of credit than that of men risen from the dead.  And as for\nthe much-despised first chapter of the book of Genesis, the speculation,\nas we are now taught, of some ancient Hebrew Descartes, He actually\nquotes the 27th verse as descriptive of the fact of creation.  I am\nbrought therefore to the conclusion that if there is any portion of the\nwhole volume which may pre-eminently be said to have the broad seal and\nstamp of our Lord\u2019s authority placed upon it with His own hand, that\nportion is the Pentateuch.  All, therefore, I am thoroughly persuaded,\nmust rise and fall together.  If we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we\nmust receive the books of Moses as inspired Scripture; and never can we\nabandon them till we are prepared to admit that in His own sacred\nteaching the Lord Himself has misled His people, or, in other and plainer\nwords, till we cease to be believers in Jesus.\n\nBut are we to limit this language of St. Paul to the Old Testament?  I\nthink it has been clearly shown that we are not.  For although the canon\nof the New Testament was not complete when St. Paul wrote these words, we\nmust remember that the second Epistle to Timothy was one of the latest\nepistles, and that, according to Horne\u2019s list, the whole of the New\nTestament, or very nearly the whole, except the writings of St. John,\nwere written at or about the time of its publication.  The only question\nis, whether these writings were then regarded as Scripture: for, if they\nwere, they were clearly included in the declaration that all Scripture is\ngiven by inspiration of God.  Now, one thing is perfectly clear, namely,\nthat St. Paul claimed the authority of Scripture for his own epistles:\nfor after having carefully drawn the distinction between his private\nopinions and inspired decisions, he distinctly says, \u2018Yet not I, but the\nLord\u2019 (1 Cor. vii. 10).  It is equally clear that St. Peter classed the\napostles with the prophets, 2 Pet. iii. 2.  It is equally clear again,\nthat the Gospel of St. Luke was already admitted as Scripture, for in 1\nTim. v. 18, St. Paul quotes two passages, one from Deuteronomy and one\nfrom St. Luke, declaring of both equally that they were taken from\nScripture.  \u2018For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn.  And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.\u2019\n(Deut. xxv. 4; Luke, x. 7.)  It is equally clear again, that St. Paul\u2019s\nEpistles were included by St. Peter in the canon; for he clearly regarded\nthem as Scripture when he wrote his second epistle.  He saw some\ndifficulties in them, but that did not affect his opinion of their\nadmitted inspiration, when he said (2 Pet. iii. 15, 16), \u2018Even as our\nbeloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath\nwritten unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these\nthings; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that\nare unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,\nunto their own destruction.\u2019\nNew Testament therefore, as well as Old, was included in the declaration,\n\u2018All scripture is given by inspiration of God;\u2019 and the conclusion to\nwhich I am irresistibly brought is, that we have no right to pick and\nchoose amongst the various portions of the word of God.  I believe the\nwhole to be arranged as a whole for the accomplishment of God\u2019s great\npurpose, that the whole is included in \u2018the Scriptures,\u2019 and that the\nparts are so interwoven one with another, and so beautifully fitted into\neach other by God\u2019s divine hand, that there will be found ultimately to\nbe no intermediate path between receiving the whole as the word of God,\nor sweeping away the whole.",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\n\nFOR the discovery of Dickens\u2019s secret in _Edwin Drood_ it is necessary to\nobtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their relations\nto each other.\n\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a\ncathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud,\nwho had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers\u2014somewhere.  They\nwere \u201cfast friends and old college companions.\u201d  Both married young.  Mr.\nBud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child, a\ndaughter, Rosa Bud.  Mr. Drood, whose wife\u2019s maiden name was Jasper, had\none son, Edwin Drood.  Mrs. Bud was drowned in a boating accident, when\nher daughter, Rosa, was a child.  Mr. Drood, already a widower, and the\nbereaved Mr. Bud \u201cbetrothed\u201d the two children, Rosa and Edwin, and then\nexpired, when the orphans were about seven and eleven years old.  The\nguardian of Rosa was a lawyer, Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with\nher mother.  To Grewgious Mr. Bud entrusted his wife\u2019s engagement ring,\nrubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to hand over to Edwin Drood, if,\nwhen he attained his majority, he and Rosa decided to marry.\n\nGrewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while Edwin\u2019s maternal\nuncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died), was\nEdwin\u2019s \u201ctrustee,\u201d as well as his uncle and devoted friend.  Rosa\u2019s\nlittle fortune was an annuity producing \u00a3250 a-year: Edwin succeeded to\nhis father\u2019s share in an engineering firm.\n\nWhen the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to proceed\nto Egypt, as an engineer.  Rosa, at school in Cloisterham, is about\nseventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.  He is conductor of the Choir of\nthe Cathedral, a \u201clay precentor;\u201d he is very dark, with thick black\nwhiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of\nopium smoking.  He began very early.  He takes this drug both in his\nlodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London,\nkept by a woman nicknamed \u201cThe Princess Puffer.\u201d  This hag, we learn, has\nbeen a determined drunkard,\u2014\u201cI drank heaven\u2019s-hard,\u201d\u2014for sixteen years\n_before_ she took to opium.  If she has been dealing in opium for ten\nyears (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable\nfor twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper\u2019s birth.  Mr. Cuming\nWalters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore,\nmaternal grandmother of Edwin Drood.  She detests her client, Jasper, and\nplays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.\n\nJasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the _fianc\u00e9e_ of his nephew, and\nhis own pupil in the musical art.  He makes her aware of his passion,\nsilently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions\nprivate.  She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on\nuncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love\nher, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their\nbetrothal.  \u201cThe bloom is off the plum\u201d of their prearranged loves, he\nsays to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed\npassion for Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.  Rosa is\naware of this fact; \u201ca glaze comes over his eyes,\u201d sometimes, she says,\n\u201cand he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream, in which he\nthreatens most . . . \u201d  The man appears to have these frightful dreams\neven when he is not under opium.\n\n\nOPENING OF THE TALE\n\n\nThe tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of\nCloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the\nPrincess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself.  This\nCathedral tower, thus early and emphatically introduced, is to play a\ngreat but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain.\nJasper, waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the\nLascar and Chinaman in their sleep.  He pronounces it \u201cunintelligible,\u201d\nwhich satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must be\nunintelligible also.  He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of\nthe eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he\nhope to understand the sleepers?  He is being watched by the hag, who\nhates him.\n\nJasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a\nnonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the\npink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow.  Jasper\ngives Edwin a dinner, and gushes over \u201chis bright boy,\u201d a lively lad,\nfull of chaff, but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of\nheart.  Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he\nloathes his life; and that the church singing \u201coften sounds to me quite\ndevilish,\u201d\u2014and no wonder.  After this dinner, Jasper has a \u201cweird\nseizure;\u201d \u201ca strange film comes over Jasper\u2019s eyes,\u201d he \u201clooks\nfrightfully ill,\u201d becomes rigid, and admits that he \u201chas been taking\nopium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.\u201d  This \u201cagony,\u201d\nwe learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin speak lightly of his love, whom\nJasper so furiously desires.  \u201cTake it as a warning,\u201d Jasper says, but\nEdwin, puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not understand.\n\nIn the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and has\na tiff with Edwin.  Sir Luke Fildes\u2019s illustration shows Edwin as \u201ca lad\nwith the bloom of a lass,\u201d with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head\nof long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been\ncut.  He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period.\n\n\nSAPSEA AND DURDLES\n\n\nNext, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at\ntheir wine, expecting a third guest.  Mr. Sapsea reads his absurd epitaph\nfor his late wife, who is buried in a \u201cMonument,\u201d a vault of some sort in\nthe Cathedral churchyard.  To them enter Durdles, a man never sober, yet\ntrusted with the key of the crypt, \u201cas contractor for rough repairs.\u201d  In\nthe crypt \u201che habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor.\u201d",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw among the company was Mr. Julius Slinkton.  There he was, standing\nbefore the fire, with good large eyes and an open expression of face; but\nstill (I thought) requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way\nhe offered, and by no other.\n\nI noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to Mr. Sampson, and my\nfriend did so.  Mr. Slinkton was very happy to see me.  Not too happy;\nthere was no over-doing of the matter; happy in a thoroughly well-bred,\nperfectly unmeaning way.\n\n\u2018I thought you had met,\u2019 our host observed.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton.  \u2018I did look in at Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, on your\nrecommendation; but I really did not feel justified in troubling Mr.\nSampson himself, on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary\nclerk.\u2019\n\nI said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend\u2019s\nintroduction.\n\n\u2018I am sure of that,\u2019 said he, \u2018and am much obliged.  At another time,\nperhaps, I may be less delicate.  Only, however, if I have real business;\nfor I know, Mr. Sampson, how precious business time is, and what a vast\nnumber of impertinent people there are in the world.\u2019\n\nI acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow.  \u2018You were thinking,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018of effecting a policy on your life.\u2019\n\n\u2018O dear no!  I am afraid I am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment\nof supposing me to be, Mr. Sampson.  I merely inquired for a friend.  But\nyou know what friends are in such matters.  Nothing may ever come of it.\nI have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries\nfor friends, knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the\nfriends will never follow them up.  People are so fickle, so selfish, so\ninconsiderate.  Don\u2019t you, in your business, find them so every day, Mr.\nSampson?\u2019\n\nI was going to give a qualified answer; but he turned his smooth, white\nparting on me with its \u2018Straight up here, if you please!\u2019 and I answered\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I hear, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he resumed presently, for our friend had a new\ncook, and dinner was not so punctual as usual, \u2018that your profession has\nrecently suffered a great loss.\u2019\n\n\u2018In money?\u2019 said I.\n\nHe laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, \u2018No,\nin talent and vigour.\u2019\n\nNot at once following out his allusion, I considered for a moment.\n\u2018_Has_ it sustained a loss of that kind?\u2019 said I.  \u2018I was not aware of\nit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understand me, Mr. Sampson.  I don\u2019t imagine that you have retired.  It\nis not so bad as that.  But Mr. Meltham\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018O, to be sure!\u2019 said I.  \u2018Yes!  Mr. Meltham, the young actuary of the\n\u201cInestimable.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Just so,\u2019 he returned in a consoling way.\n\n\u2018He is a great loss.  He was at once the most profound, the most\noriginal, and the most energetic man I have ever known connected with\nLife Assurance.\u2019\n\nI spoke strongly; for I had a high esteem and admiration for Meltham; and\nmy gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he\nwanted to sneer at him.  He recalled me to my guard by presenting that\ntrim pathway up his head, with its internal \u2018Not on the grass, if you\nplease\u2014the gravel.\u2019\n\n\u2018You knew him, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\n\u2018Only by reputation.  To have known him as an acquaintance or as a\nfriend, is an honour I should have sought if he had remained in society,\nthough I might never have had the good fortune to attain it, being a man\nof far inferior mark.  He was scarcely above thirty, I suppose?\u2019\n\n\u2018About thirty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 he sighed in his former consoling way.  \u2018What creatures we are!  To\nbreak up, Mr. Sampson, and become incapable of business at that time of\nlife!\u2014Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?\u2019\n\n(\u2018Humph!\u2019 thought I, as I looked at him.  \u2018But I WON\u2019T go up the track,\nand I WILL go on the grass.\u2019)\n\n\u2018What reason have you heard assigned, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked,\npoint-blank.\n\n\u2018Most likely a false one.  You know what Rumour is, Mr. Sampson.  I never\nrepeat what I hear; it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving\nthe head of Rumour.  But when _you_ ask me what reason I have heard\nassigned for Mr. Meltham\u2019s passing away from among men, it is another\nthing.  I am not gratifying idle gossip then.  I was told, Mr. Sampson,\nthat Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his\nprospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted.  A disappointed\nattachment I heard,\u2014though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man\nso distinguished and so attractive.\u2019\n\n\u2018Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018O, she died?  Pray pardon me.  I did not hear that.  That, indeed, makes\nit very, very sad.  Poor Mr. Meltham!  She died?  Ah, dear me!\nLamentable, lamentable!\u2019\n\nI still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an\nunaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted,\nlike the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:\n\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man\nwhom I have never known.  I am not so disinterested as you may suppose.\nI have suffered, and recently too, from death myself.  I have lost one of\ntwo charming nieces, who were my constant companions.  She died\nyoung\u2014barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from\nstrong.  The world is a grave!\u2019\n\nHe said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of\nmy manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by\nmy bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how\nmuch I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had\ngained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I\ntroubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled\nmyself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and\nobserved how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful\ninstinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he\ntalked with.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n       ",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771).",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours.

A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?\n\nNow, whatever men may think of the doctrine of inspiration, all must\nadmit as an historical fact, that when St. Paul wrote these words, the\nwhole of the Old Testament was included in the Jewish canon.  The Jews,\nnotwithstanding all their faults, were admirable guardians of Scripture,\nand there was no doubt in the mind of any pious Jew as to what books\ntogether formed his Bible.  He was much clearer on that subject than many\nof our modern writers.  When therefore St. Paul spoke of \u2018All Scripture,\u2019\nthere is no doubt in the world that he included in his statement every\nline and letter of the Old Testament, and he taught us in those words\nthat the whole, from first to last, from the first of Genesis to the last\nof Malachi was given by inspiration of God.\n\nIn saying this, I make no exception whatever with reference to the\nhistorical books.  I think it has been clearly shown that those\nhistorical writings which are not in the Pentateuch are included in that\npart of Scripture called the Prophets.  In which case the language of St.\nPeter, already quoted, refers to history as well as prediction.  Nay,\nmore!  I do not hesitate to say, that if I were called upon to prove\ninspiration, there is no portion of the whole volume on which I should be\nbetter pleased to meet an opponent than the historical portions of the\nOld Testament.  So strong is the argument in their favour, that although\nby so saying I may startle some, I am prepared, after the most careful\ndeliberation, to affirm that I cannot separate them from the word of God\nwithout at the same time abandoning the whole of my Christianity.  My\nreason for this statement is, that our Lord Himself in His own teaching\nhas most distinctly sanctioned them.  Men cavil at the strange miracles\nrecorded in them, but, while men cavil, He refers to no less than nine of\nthese miracles as facts.  The flood, the destruction of Sodom and\nGomorrah, the death of Lot\u2019s wife, the burning bush, the manna, the\nbrazen serpent, the cure of Naaman, the preservation of the widow of\nSarepta, and the rescue of Jonah, are all endorsed by His divine\nauthority.  To the books of Moses, which are chiefly historical, He\nperpetually refers as to the word of God, describing their testimony as\nmore worthy of credit than that of men risen from the dead.  And as for\nthe much-despised first chapter of the book of Genesis, the speculation,\nas we are now taught, of some ancient Hebrew Descartes, He actually\nquotes the 27th verse as descriptive of the fact of creation.  I am\nbrought therefore to the conclusion that if there is any portion of the\nwhole volume which may pre-eminently be said to have the broad seal and\nstamp of our Lord\u2019s authority placed upon it with His own hand, that\nportion is the Pentateuch.  All, therefore, I am thoroughly persuaded,\nmust rise and fall together.  If we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we\nmust receive the books of Moses as inspired Scripture; and never can we\nabandon them till we are prepared to admit that in His own sacred\nteaching the Lord Himself has misled His people, or, in other and plainer\nwords, till we cease to be believers in Jesus.\n\nBut are we to limit this language of St. Paul to the Old Testament?  I\nthink it has been clearly shown that we are not.  For although the canon\nof the New Testament was not complete when St. Paul wrote these words, we\nmust remember that the second Epistle to Timothy was one of the latest\nepistles, and that, according to Horne\u2019s list, the whole of the New\nTestament, or very nearly the whole, except the writings of St. John,\nwere written at or about the time of its publication.  The only question\nis, whether these writings were then regarded as Scripture: for, if they\nwere, they were clearly included in the declaration that all Scripture is\ngiven by inspiration of God.  Now, one thing is perfectly clear, namely,\nthat St. Paul claimed the authority of Scripture for his own epistles:\nfor after having carefully drawn the distinction between his private\nopinions and inspired decisions, he distinctly says, \u2018Yet not I, but the\nLord\u2019 (1 Cor. vii. 10).  It is equally clear that St. Peter classed the\napostles with the prophets, 2 Pet. iii. 2.  It is equally clear again,\nthat the Gospel of St. Luke was already admitted as Scripture, for in 1\nTim. v. 18, St. Paul quotes two passages, one from Deuteronomy and one\nfrom St. Luke, declaring of both equally that they were taken from\nScripture.  \u2018For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn.  And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.\u2019\n(Deut. xxv. 4; Luke, x. 7.)  It is equally clear again, that St. Paul\u2019s\nEpistles were included by St. Peter in the canon; for he clearly regarded\nthem as Scripture when he wrote his second epistle.  He saw some\ndifficulties in them, but that did not affect his opinion of their\nadmitted inspiration, when he said (2 Pet. iii. 15, 16), \u2018Even as our\nbeloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath\nwritten unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these\nthings; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that\nare unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,\nunto their own destruction.\u2019\nNew Testament therefore, as well as Old, was included in the declaration,\n\u2018All scripture is given by inspiration of God;\u2019 and the conclusion to\nwhich I am irresistibly brought is, that we have no right to pick and\nchoose amongst the various portions of the word of God.  I believe the\nwhole to be arranged as a whole for the accomplishment of God\u2019s great\npurpose, that the whole is included in \u2018the Scriptures,\u2019 and that the\nparts are so interwoven one with another, and so beautifully fitted into\neach other by God\u2019s divine hand, that there will be found ultimately to\nbe no intermediate path between receiving the whole as the word of God,\nor sweeping away the whole.",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\n\nFOR the discovery of Dickens\u2019s secret in _Edwin Drood_ it is necessary to\nobtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their relations\nto each other.\n\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a\ncathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud,\nwho had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers\u2014somewhere.  They\nwere \u201cfast friends and old college companions.\u201d  Both married young.  Mr.\nBud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child, a\ndaughter, Rosa Bud.  Mr. Drood, whose wife\u2019s maiden name was Jasper, had\none son, Edwin Drood.  Mrs. Bud was drowned in a boating accident, when\nher daughter, Rosa, was a child.  Mr. Drood, already a widower, and the\nbereaved Mr. Bud \u201cbetrothed\u201d the two children, Rosa and Edwin, and then\nexpired, when the orphans were about seven and eleven years old.  The\nguardian of Rosa was a lawyer, Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with\nher mother.  To Grewgious Mr. Bud entrusted his wife\u2019s engagement ring,\nrubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to hand over to Edwin Drood, if,\nwhen he attained his majority, he and Rosa decided to marry.\n\nGrewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while Edwin\u2019s maternal\nuncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died), was\nEdwin\u2019s \u201ctrustee,\u201d as well as his uncle and devoted friend.  Rosa\u2019s\nlittle fortune was an annuity producing \u00a3250 a-year: Edwin succeeded to\nhis father\u2019s share in an engineering firm.\n\nWhen the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to proceed\nto Egypt, as an engineer.  Rosa, at school in Cloisterham, is about\nseventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.  He is conductor of the Choir of\nthe Cathedral, a \u201clay precentor;\u201d he is very dark, with thick black\nwhiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of\nopium smoking.  He began very early.  He takes this drug both in his\nlodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London,\nkept by a woman nicknamed \u201cThe Princess Puffer.\u201d  This hag, we learn, has\nbeen a determined drunkard,\u2014\u201cI drank heaven\u2019s-hard,\u201d\u2014for sixteen years\n_before_ she took to opium.  If she has been dealing in opium for ten\nyears (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable\nfor twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper\u2019s birth.  Mr. Cuming\nWalters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore,\nmaternal grandmother of Edwin Drood.  She detests her client, Jasper, and\nplays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.\n\nJasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the _fianc\u00e9e_ of his nephew, and\nhis own pupil in the musical art.  He makes her aware of his passion,\nsilently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions\nprivate.  She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on\nuncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love\nher, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their\nbetrothal.  \u201cThe bloom is off the plum\u201d of their prearranged loves, he\nsays to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed\npassion for Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.  Rosa is\naware of this fact; \u201ca glaze comes over his eyes,\u201d sometimes, she says,\n\u201cand he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream, in which he\nthreatens most . . . \u201d  The man appears to have these frightful dreams\neven when he is not under opium.\n\n\nOPENING OF THE TALE\n\n\nThe tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of\nCloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the\nPrincess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself.  This\nCathedral tower, thus early and emphatically introduced, is to play a\ngreat but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain.\nJasper, waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the\nLascar and Chinaman in their sleep.  He pronounces it \u201cunintelligible,\u201d\nwhich satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must be\nunintelligible also.  He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of\nthe eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he\nhope to understand the sleepers?  He is being watched by the hag, who\nhates him.\n\nJasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a\nnonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the\npink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow.  Jasper\ngives Edwin a dinner, and gushes over \u201chis bright boy,\u201d a lively lad,\nfull of chaff, but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of\nheart.  Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he\nloathes his life; and that the church singing \u201coften sounds to me quite\ndevilish,\u201d\u2014and no wonder.  After this dinner, Jasper has a \u201cweird\nseizure;\u201d \u201ca strange film comes over Jasper\u2019s eyes,\u201d he \u201clooks\nfrightfully ill,\u201d becomes rigid, and admits that he \u201chas been taking\nopium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.\u201d  This \u201cagony,\u201d\nwe learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin speak lightly of his love, whom\nJasper so furiously desires.  \u201cTake it as a warning,\u201d Jasper says, but\nEdwin, puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not understand.\n\nIn the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and has\na tiff with Edwin.  Sir Luke Fildes\u2019s illustration shows Edwin as \u201ca lad\nwith the bloom of a lass,\u201d with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head\nof long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been\ncut.  He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period.\n\n\nSAPSEA AND DURDLES\n\n\nNext, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at\ntheir wine, expecting a third guest.  Mr. Sapsea reads his absurd epitaph\nfor his late wife, who is buried in a \u201cMonument,\u201d a vault of some sort in\nthe Cathedral churchyard.  To them enter Durdles, a man never sober, yet\ntrusted with the key of the crypt, \u201cas contractor for rough repairs.\u201d  In\nthe crypt \u201che habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor.\u201d",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw among the company was Mr. Julius Slinkton.  There he was, standing\nbefore the fire, with good large eyes and an open expression of face; but\nstill (I thought) requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way\nhe offered, and by no other.\n\nI noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to Mr. Sampson, and my\nfriend did so.  Mr. Slinkton was very happy to see me.  Not too happy;\nthere was no over-doing of the matter; happy in a thoroughly well-bred,\nperfectly unmeaning way.\n\n\u2018I thought you had met,\u2019 our host observed.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton.  \u2018I did look in at Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, on your\nrecommendation; but I really did not feel justified in troubling Mr.\nSampson himself, on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary\nclerk.\u2019\n\nI said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend\u2019s\nintroduction.\n\n\u2018I am sure of that,\u2019 said he, \u2018and am much obliged.  At another time,\nperhaps, I may be less delicate.  Only, however, if I have real business;\nfor I know, Mr. Sampson, how precious business time is, and what a vast\nnumber of impertinent people there are in the world.\u2019\n\nI acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow.  \u2018You were thinking,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018of effecting a policy on your life.\u2019\n\n\u2018O dear no!  I am afraid I am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment\nof supposing me to be, Mr. Sampson.  I merely inquired for a friend.  But\nyou know what friends are in such matters.  Nothing may ever come of it.\nI have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries\nfor friends, knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the\nfriends will never follow them up.  People are so fickle, so selfish, so\ninconsiderate.  Don\u2019t you, in your business, find them so every day, Mr.\nSampson?\u2019\n\nI was going to give a qualified answer; but he turned his smooth, white\nparting on me with its \u2018Straight up here, if you please!\u2019 and I answered\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I hear, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he resumed presently, for our friend had a new\ncook, and dinner was not so punctual as usual, \u2018that your profession has\nrecently suffered a great loss.\u2019\n\n\u2018In money?\u2019 said I.\n\nHe laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, \u2018No,\nin talent and vigour.\u2019\n\nNot at once following out his allusion, I considered for a moment.\n\u2018_Has_ it sustained a loss of that kind?\u2019 said I.  \u2018I was not aware of\nit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understand me, Mr. Sampson.  I don\u2019t imagine that you have retired.  It\nis not so bad as that.  But Mr. Meltham\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018O, to be sure!\u2019 said I.  \u2018Yes!  Mr. Meltham, the young actuary of the\n\u201cInestimable.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Just so,\u2019 he returned in a consoling way.\n\n\u2018He is a great loss.  He was at once the most profound, the most\noriginal, and the most energetic man I have ever known connected with\nLife Assurance.\u2019\n\nI spoke strongly; for I had a high esteem and admiration for Meltham; and\nmy gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he\nwanted to sneer at him.  He recalled me to my guard by presenting that\ntrim pathway up his head, with its internal \u2018Not on the grass, if you\nplease\u2014the gravel.\u2019\n\n\u2018You knew him, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\n\u2018Only by reputation.  To have known him as an acquaintance or as a\nfriend, is an honour I should have sought if he had remained in society,\nthough I might never have had the good fortune to attain it, being a man\nof far inferior mark.  He was scarcely above thirty, I suppose?\u2019\n\n\u2018About thirty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 he sighed in his former consoling way.  \u2018What creatures we are!  To\nbreak up, Mr. Sampson, and become incapable of business at that time of\nlife!\u2014Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?\u2019\n\n(\u2018Humph!\u2019 thought I, as I looked at him.  \u2018But I WON\u2019T go up the track,\nand I WILL go on the grass.\u2019)\n\n\u2018What reason have you heard assigned, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked,\npoint-blank.\n\n\u2018Most likely a false one.  You know what Rumour is, Mr. Sampson.  I never\nrepeat what I hear; it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving\nthe head of Rumour.  But when _you_ ask me what reason I have heard\nassigned for Mr. Meltham\u2019s passing away from among men, it is another\nthing.  I am not gratifying idle gossip then.  I was told, Mr. Sampson,\nthat Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his\nprospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted.  A disappointed\nattachment I heard,\u2014though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man\nso distinguished and so attractive.\u2019\n\n\u2018Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018O, she died?  Pray pardon me.  I did not hear that.  That, indeed, makes\nit very, very sad.  Poor Mr. Meltham!  She died?  Ah, dear me!\nLamentable, lamentable!\u2019\n\nI still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an\nunaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted,\nlike the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:\n\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man\nwhom I have never known.  I am not so disinterested as you may suppose.\nI have suffered, and recently too, from death myself.  I have lost one of\ntwo charming nieces, who were my constant companions.  She died\nyoung\u2014barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from\nstrong.  The world is a grave!\u2019\n\nHe said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of\nmy manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by\nmy bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how\nmuch I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had\ngained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I\ntroubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled\nmyself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and\nobserved how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful\ninstinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he\ntalked with.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh!

                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n       ",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771).",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?\n\nNow, whatever men may think of the doctrine of inspiration, all must\nadmit as an historical fact, that when St. Paul wrote these words, the\nwhole of the Old Testament was included in the Jewish canon.  The Jews,\nnotwithstanding all their faults, were admirable guardians of Scripture,\nand there was no doubt in the mind of any pious Jew as to what books\ntogether formed his Bible.  He was much clearer on that subject than many\nof our modern writers.  When therefore St. Paul spoke of \u2018All Scripture,\u2019\nthere is no doubt in the world that he included in his statement every\nline and letter of the Old Testament, and he taught us in those words\nthat the whole, from first to last, from the first of Genesis to the last\nof Malachi was given by inspiration of God.\n\nIn saying this, I make no exception whatever with reference to the\nhistorical books.  I think it has been clearly shown that those\nhistorical writings which are not in the Pentateuch are included in that\npart of Scripture called the Prophets.  In which case the language of St.\nPeter, already quoted, refers to history as well as prediction.  Nay,\nmore!  I do not hesitate to say, that if I were called upon to prove\ninspiration, there is no portion of the whole volume on which I should be\nbetter pleased to meet an opponent than the historical portions of the\nOld Testament.  So strong is the argument in their favour, that although\nby so saying I may startle some, I am prepared, after the most careful\ndeliberation, to affirm that I cannot separate them from the word of God\nwithout at the same time abandoning the whole of my Christianity.  My\nreason for this statement is, that our Lord Himself in His own teaching\nhas most distinctly sanctioned them.  Men cavil at the strange miracles\nrecorded in them, but, while men cavil, He refers to no less than nine of\nthese miracles as facts.  The flood, the destruction of Sodom and\nGomorrah, the death of Lot\u2019s wife, the burning bush, the manna, the\nbrazen serpent, the cure of Naaman, the preservation of the widow of\nSarepta, and the rescue of Jonah, are all endorsed by His divine\nauthority.  To the books of Moses, which are chiefly historical, He\nperpetually refers as to the word of God, describing their testimony as\nmore worthy of credit than that of men risen from the dead.  And as for\nthe much-despised first chapter of the book of Genesis, the speculation,\nas we are now taught, of some ancient Hebrew Descartes, He actually\nquotes the 27th verse as descriptive of the fact of creation.  I am\nbrought therefore to the conclusion that if there is any portion of the\nwhole volume which may pre-eminently be said to have the broad seal and\nstamp of our Lord\u2019s authority placed upon it with His own hand, that\nportion is the Pentateuch.  All, therefore, I am thoroughly persuaded,\nmust rise and fall together.  If we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we\nmust receive the books of Moses as inspired Scripture; and never can we\nabandon them till we are prepared to admit that in His own sacred\nteaching the Lord Himself has misled His people, or, in other and plainer\nwords, till we cease to be believers in Jesus.\n\nBut are we to limit this language of St. Paul to the Old Testament?  I\nthink it has been clearly shown that we are not.  For although the canon\nof the New Testament was not complete when St. Paul wrote these words, we\nmust remember that the second Epistle to Timothy was one of the latest\nepistles, and that, according to Horne\u2019s list, the whole of the New\nTestament, or very nearly the whole, except the writings of St. John,\nwere written at or about the time of its publication.  The only question\nis, whether these writings were then regarded as Scripture: for, if they\nwere, they were clearly included in the declaration that all Scripture is\ngiven by inspiration of God.  Now, one thing is perfectly clear, namely,\nthat St. Paul claimed the authority of Scripture for his own epistles:\nfor after having carefully drawn the distinction between his private\nopinions and inspired decisions, he distinctly says, \u2018Yet not I, but the\nLord\u2019 (1 Cor. vii. 10).  It is equally clear that St. Peter classed the\napostles with the prophets, 2 Pet. iii. 2.  It is equally clear again,\nthat the Gospel of St. Luke was already admitted as Scripture, for in 1\nTim. v. 18, St. Paul quotes two passages, one from Deuteronomy and one\nfrom St. Luke, declaring of both equally that they were taken from\nScripture.  \u2018For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn.  And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.\u2019\n(Deut. xxv. 4; Luke, x. 7.)  It is equally clear again, that St. Paul\u2019s\nEpistles were included by St. Peter in the canon; for he clearly regarded\nthem as Scripture when he wrote his second epistle.  He saw some\ndifficulties in them, but that did not affect his opinion of their\nadmitted inspiration, when he said (2 Pet. iii. 15, 16), \u2018Even as our\nbeloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath\nwritten unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these\nthings; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that\nare unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,\nunto their own destruction.\u2019\nNew Testament therefore, as well as Old, was included in the declaration,\n\u2018All scripture is given by inspiration of God;\u2019 and the conclusion to\nwhich I am irresistibly brought is, that we have no right to pick and\nchoose amongst the various portions of the word of God.  I believe the\nwhole to be arranged as a whole for the accomplishment of God\u2019s great\npurpose, that the whole is included in \u2018the Scriptures,\u2019 and that the\nparts are so interwoven one with another, and so beautifully fitted into\neach other by God\u2019s divine hand, that there will be found ultimately to\nbe no intermediate path between receiving the whole as the word of God,\nor sweeping away the whole.",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\n\nFOR the discovery of Dickens\u2019s secret in _Edwin Drood_ it is necessary to\nobtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their relations\nto each other.\n\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a\ncathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud,\nwho had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers\u2014somewhere.  They\nwere \u201cfast friends and old college companions.\u201d  Both married young.  Mr.\nBud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child, a\ndaughter, Rosa Bud.  Mr. Drood, whose wife\u2019s maiden name was Jasper, had\none son, Edwin Drood.  Mrs. Bud was drowned in a boating accident, when\nher daughter, Rosa, was a child.  Mr. Drood, already a widower, and the\nbereaved Mr. Bud \u201cbetrothed\u201d the two children, Rosa and Edwin, and then\nexpired, when the orphans were about seven and eleven years old.  The\nguardian of Rosa was a lawyer, Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with\nher mother.  To Grewgious Mr. Bud entrusted his wife\u2019s engagement ring,\nrubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to hand over to Edwin Drood, if,\nwhen he attained his majority, he and Rosa decided to marry.\n\nGrewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while Edwin\u2019s maternal\nuncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died), was\nEdwin\u2019s \u201ctrustee,\u201d as well as his uncle and devoted friend.  Rosa\u2019s\nlittle fortune was an annuity producing \u00a3250 a-year: Edwin succeeded to\nhis father\u2019s share in an engineering firm.\n\nWhen the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to proceed\nto Egypt, as an engineer.  Rosa, at school in Cloisterham, is about\nseventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.  He is conductor of the Choir of\nthe Cathedral, a \u201clay precentor;\u201d he is very dark, with thick black\nwhiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of\nopium smoking.  He began very early.  He takes this drug both in his\nlodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London,\nkept by a woman nicknamed \u201cThe Princess Puffer.\u201d  This hag, we learn, has\nbeen a determined drunkard,\u2014\u201cI drank heaven\u2019s-hard,\u201d\u2014for sixteen years\n_before_ she took to opium.  If she has been dealing in opium for ten\nyears (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable\nfor twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper\u2019s birth.  Mr. Cuming\nWalters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore,\nmaternal grandmother of Edwin Drood.  She detests her client, Jasper, and\nplays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.\n\nJasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the _fianc\u00e9e_ of his nephew, and\nhis own pupil in the musical art.  He makes her aware of his passion,\nsilently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions\nprivate.  She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on\nuncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love\nher, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their\nbetrothal.  \u201cThe bloom is off the plum\u201d of their prearranged loves, he\nsays to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed\npassion for Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.  Rosa is\naware of this fact; \u201ca glaze comes over his eyes,\u201d sometimes, she says,\n\u201cand he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream, in which he\nthreatens most . . . \u201d  The man appears to have these frightful dreams\neven when he is not under opium.\n\n\nOPENING OF THE TALE\n\n\nThe tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of\nCloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the\nPrincess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself.  This\nCathedral tower, thus early and emphatically introduced, is to play a\ngreat but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain.\nJasper, waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the\nLascar and Chinaman in their sleep.  He pronounces it \u201cunintelligible,\u201d\nwhich satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must be\nunintelligible also.  He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of\nthe eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he\nhope to understand the sleepers?  He is being watched by the hag, who\nhates him.\n\nJasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a\nnonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the\npink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow.  Jasper\ngives Edwin a dinner, and gushes over \u201chis bright boy,\u201d a lively lad,\nfull of chaff, but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of\nheart.  Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he\nloathes his life; and that the church singing \u201coften sounds to me quite\ndevilish,\u201d\u2014and no wonder.  After this dinner, Jasper has a \u201cweird\nseizure;\u201d \u201ca strange film comes over Jasper\u2019s eyes,\u201d he \u201clooks\nfrightfully ill,\u201d becomes rigid, and admits that he \u201chas been taking\nopium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.\u201d  This \u201cagony,\u201d\nwe learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin speak lightly of his love, whom\nJasper so furiously desires.  \u201cTake it as a warning,\u201d Jasper says, but\nEdwin, puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not understand.\n\nIn the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and has\na tiff with Edwin.  Sir Luke Fildes\u2019s illustration shows Edwin as \u201ca lad\nwith the bloom of a lass,\u201d with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head\nof long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been\ncut.  He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period.\n\n\nSAPSEA AND DURDLES\n\n\nNext, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at\ntheir wine, expecting a third guest.  Mr. Sapsea reads his absurd epitaph\nfor his late wife, who is buried in a \u201cMonument,\u201d a vault of some sort in\nthe Cathedral churchyard.  To them enter Durdles, a man never sober, yet\ntrusted with the key of the crypt, \u201cas contractor for rough repairs.\u201d  In\nthe crypt \u201che habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor.\u201d",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw among the company was Mr. Julius Slinkton.  There he was, standing\nbefore the fire, with good large eyes and an open expression of face; but\nstill (I thought) requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way\nhe offered, and by no other.\n\nI noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to Mr. Sampson, and my\nfriend did so.  Mr. Slinkton was very happy to see me.  Not too happy;\nthere was no over-doing of the matter; happy in a thoroughly well-bred,\nperfectly unmeaning way.\n\n\u2018I thought you had met,\u2019 our host observed.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton.  \u2018I did look in at Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, on your\nrecommendation; but I really did not feel justified in troubling Mr.\nSampson himself, on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary\nclerk.\u2019\n\nI said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend\u2019s\nintroduction.\n\n\u2018I am sure of that,\u2019 said he, \u2018and am much obliged.  At another time,\nperhaps, I may be less delicate.  Only, however, if I have real business;\nfor I know, Mr. Sampson, how precious business time is, and what a vast\nnumber of impertinent people there are in the world.\u2019\n\nI acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow.  \u2018You were thinking,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018of effecting a policy on your life.\u2019\n\n\u2018O dear no!  I am afraid I am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment\nof supposing me to be, Mr. Sampson.  I merely inquired for a friend.  But\nyou know what friends are in such matters.  Nothing may ever come of it.\nI have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries\nfor friends, knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the\nfriends will never follow them up.  People are so fickle, so selfish, so\ninconsiderate.  Don\u2019t you, in your business, find them so every day, Mr.\nSampson?\u2019\n\nI was going to give a qualified answer; but he turned his smooth, white\nparting on me with its \u2018Straight up here, if you please!\u2019 and I answered\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I hear, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he resumed presently, for our friend had a new\ncook, and dinner was not so punctual as usual, \u2018that your profession has\nrecently suffered a great loss.\u2019\n\n\u2018In money?\u2019 said I.\n\nHe laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, \u2018No,\nin talent and vigour.\u2019\n\nNot at once following out his allusion, I considered for a moment.\n\u2018_Has_ it sustained a loss of that kind?\u2019 said I.  \u2018I was not aware of\nit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understand me, Mr. Sampson.  I don\u2019t imagine that you have retired.  It\nis not so bad as that.  But Mr. Meltham\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018O, to be sure!\u2019 said I.  \u2018Yes!  Mr. Meltham, the young actuary of the\n\u201cInestimable.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Just so,\u2019 he returned in a consoling way.\n\n\u2018He is a great loss.  He was at once the most profound, the most\noriginal, and the most energetic man I have ever known connected with\nLife Assurance.\u2019\n\nI spoke strongly; for I had a high esteem and admiration for Meltham; and\nmy gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he\nwanted to sneer at him.  He recalled me to my guard by presenting that\ntrim pathway up his head, with its internal \u2018Not on the grass, if you\nplease\u2014the gravel.\u2019\n\n\u2018You knew him, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\n\u2018Only by reputation.  To have known him as an acquaintance or as a\nfriend, is an honour I should have sought if he had remained in society,\nthough I might never have had the good fortune to attain it, being a man\nof far inferior mark.  He was scarcely above thirty, I suppose?\u2019\n\n\u2018About thirty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 he sighed in his former consoling way.  \u2018What creatures we are!  To\nbreak up, Mr. Sampson, and become incapable of business at that time of\nlife!\u2014Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?\u2019\n\n(\u2018Humph!\u2019 thought I, as I looked at him.  \u2018But I WON\u2019T go up the track,\nand I WILL go on the grass.\u2019)\n\n\u2018What reason have you heard assigned, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked,\npoint-blank.\n\n\u2018Most likely a false one.  You know what Rumour is, Mr. Sampson.  I never\nrepeat what I hear; it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving\nthe head of Rumour.  But when _you_ ask me what reason I have heard\nassigned for Mr. Meltham\u2019s passing away from among men, it is another\nthing.  I am not gratifying idle gossip then.  I was told, Mr. Sampson,\nthat Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his\nprospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted.  A disappointed\nattachment I heard,\u2014though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man\nso distinguished and so attractive.\u2019\n\n\u2018Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018O, she died?  Pray pardon me.  I did not hear that.  That, indeed, makes\nit very, very sad.  Poor Mr. Meltham!  She died?  Ah, dear me!\nLamentable, lamentable!\u2019\n\nI still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an\nunaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted,\nlike the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:\n\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man\nwhom I have never known.  I am not so disinterested as you may suppose.\nI have suffered, and recently too, from death myself.  I have lost one of\ntwo charming nieces, who were my constant companions.  She died\nyoung\u2014barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from\nstrong.  The world is a grave!\u2019\n\nHe said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of\nmy manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by\nmy bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how\nmuch I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had\ngained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I\ntroubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled\nmyself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and\nobserved how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful\ninstinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he\ntalked with.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n       ",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771).",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?\n\nNow, whatever men may think of the doctrine of inspiration, all must\nadmit as an historical fact, that when St. Paul wrote these words, the\nwhole of the Old Testament was included in the Jewish canon.  The Jews,\nnotwithstanding all their faults, were admirable guardians of Scripture,\nand there was no doubt in the mind of any pious Jew as to what books\ntogether formed his Bible.  He was much clearer on that subject than many\nof our modern writers.  When therefore St. Paul spoke of \u2018All Scripture,\u2019\nthere is no doubt in the world that he included in his statement every\nline and letter of the Old Testament, and he taught us in those words\nthat the whole, from first to last, from the first of Genesis to the last\nof Malachi was given by inspiration of God.\n\nIn saying this, I make no exception whatever with reference to the\nhistorical books.  I think it has been clearly shown that those\nhistorical writings which are not in the Pentateuch are included in that\npart of Scripture called the Prophets.  In which case the language of St.\nPeter, already quoted, refers to history as well as prediction.  Nay,\nmore!  I do not hesitate to say, that if I were called upon to prove\ninspiration, there is no portion of the whole volume on which I should be\nbetter pleased to meet an opponent than the historical portions of the\nOld Testament.  So strong is the argument in their favour, that although\nby so saying I may startle some, I am prepared, after the most careful\ndeliberation, to affirm that I cannot separate them from the word of God\nwithout at the same time abandoning the whole of my Christianity.  My\nreason for this statement is, that our Lord Himself in His own teaching\nhas most distinctly sanctioned them.  Men cavil at the strange miracles\nrecorded in them, but, while men cavil, He refers to no less than nine of\nthese miracles as facts.  The flood, the destruction of Sodom and\nGomorrah, the death of Lot\u2019s wife, the burning bush, the manna, the\nbrazen serpent, the cure of Naaman, the preservation of the widow of\nSarepta, and the rescue of Jonah, are all endorsed by His divine\nauthority.  To the books of Moses, which are chiefly historical, He\nperpetually refers as to the word of God, describing their testimony as\nmore worthy of credit than that of men risen from the dead.  And as for\nthe much-despised first chapter of the book of Genesis, the speculation,\nas we are now taught, of some ancient Hebrew Descartes, He actually\nquotes the 27th verse as descriptive of the fact of creation.  I am\nbrought therefore to the conclusion that if there is any portion of the\nwhole volume which may pre-eminently be said to have the broad seal and\nstamp of our Lord\u2019s authority placed upon it with His own hand, that\nportion is the Pentateuch.  All, therefore, I am thoroughly persuaded,\nmust rise and fall together.  If we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we\nmust receive the books of Moses as inspired Scripture; and never can we\nabandon them till we are prepared to admit that in His own sacred\nteaching the Lord Himself has misled His people, or, in other and plainer\nwords, till we cease to be believers in Jesus.\n\nBut are we to limit this language of St. Paul to the Old Testament?  I\nthink it has been clearly shown that we are not.  For although the canon\nof the New Testament was not complete when St. Paul wrote these words, we\nmust remember that the second Epistle to Timothy was one of the latest\nepistles, and that, according to Horne\u2019s list, the whole of the New\nTestament, or very nearly the whole, except the writings of St. John,\nwere written at or about the time of its publication.  The only question\nis, whether these writings were then regarded as Scripture: for, if they\nwere, they were clearly included in the declaration that all Scripture is\ngiven by inspiration of God.  Now, one thing is perfectly clear, namely,\nthat St. Paul claimed the authority of Scripture for his own epistles:\nfor after having carefully drawn the distinction between his private\nopinions and inspired decisions, he distinctly says, \u2018Yet not I, but the\nLord\u2019 (1 Cor. vii. 10).  It is equally clear that St. Peter classed the\napostles with the prophets, 2 Pet. iii. 2.  It is equally clear again,\nthat the Gospel of St. Luke was already admitted as Scripture, for in 1\nTim. v. 18, St. Paul quotes two passages, one from Deuteronomy and one\nfrom St. Luke, declaring of both equally that they were taken from\nScripture.  \u2018For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn.  And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.\u2019\n(Deut. xxv. 4; Luke, x. 7.)  It is equally clear again, that St. Paul\u2019s\nEpistles were included by St. Peter in the canon; for he clearly regarded\nthem as Scripture when he wrote his second epistle.  He saw some\ndifficulties in them, but that did not affect his opinion of their\nadmitted inspiration, when he said (2 Pet. iii. 15, 16), \u2018Even as our\nbeloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath\nwritten unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these\nthings; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that\nare unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,\nunto their own destruction.\u2019\nNew Testament therefore, as well as Old, was included in the declaration,\n\u2018All scripture is given by inspiration of God;\u2019 and the conclusion to\nwhich I am irresistibly brought is, that we have no right to pick and\nchoose amongst the various portions of the word of God.  I believe the\nwhole to be arranged as a whole for the accomplishment of God\u2019s great\npurpose, that the whole is included in \u2018the Scriptures,\u2019 and that the\nparts are so interwoven one with another, and so beautifully fitted into\neach other by God\u2019s divine hand, that there will be found ultimately to\nbe no intermediate path between receiving the whole as the word of God,\nor sweeping away the whole.",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.

                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father.

In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted."

                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.",
                "-THE PUZZLE OF DICKENS\u2019S LAST PLOT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nFORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from _Bleak House_\nonwards (1853), \u201cassiduously cultivated\u201d construction, \u201cthis essential of\nhis art.\u201d  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best novels\nin the world \u201chave no outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a\ndemned outline,\u201d elaborate construction is not absolutely \u201cessential.\u201d\nReally essential are character, \u201catmosphere,\u201d humour.\n\nBut as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of restless\nand unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits\ndeserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what Scott, speaking of\nhimself, calls the manner of \u201chab nab at a venture.\u201d  He constructed\nelaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.  He emulated the manner\nof Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he combined with some of\nthe elements of the detective novel, or _roman policier_, careful study\nof character.  Except _Great Expectations_, none of his later tales\nrivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as\n_Pickwick_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_.  \u201cYouth will be served;\u201d no sedulous\ncare could compensate for the exuberance of \u201cthe first sprightly\nrunnings.\u201d  In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of\nRalph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the\ninnumerable attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the\nsecret that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the\nreader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.\n\nIn April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American readings;\nof that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad\nhealth\u2014found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported, \u201con the brink of an\nattack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly of apoplexy.\u201d  He\ntherefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We think of Scott\u2019s\nearlier seizures of a similar kind, after which _Peveril_, he said,\n\u201csmacked of the apoplexy.\u201d  But Dickens\u2019s new story of _The Mystery of\nEdwin Drood_, first contemplated in July, 1869, and altered in character\nby the emergence of \u201ca very curious and new idea,\u201d early in August, does\nnot \u201csmack of the apoplexy.\u201d  We may think that the mannerisms of Mr.\nHoneythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the\nschoolmistress, are not in the author\u2019s best vein of humour.  \u201cThe\nBillickin,\u201d on the other hand, the lodging-house keeper, is \u201cin very\ngracious fooling:\u201d her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss\nTwinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr. Grewgious may be\ncaricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always good at\nboys, presents a _gamin_, in Deputy, who is in not unpleasant contrast\nwith the pathetic Jo of _Bleak House_.  Opinions may differ as to Edwin\nand Rosa, but the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks\nof that character.  As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless, the\nrestraint which she puts on her \u201ctigerish blood\u201d is admirable: she is\nvery fresh and original.  The villain is all that melodrama can desire,\nbut what we do miss, I think, is the \u201catmosphere\u201d of a small cathedral\ntown.  Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on the\nother hand, the opium den is studied from the life.\n\nOn the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,\nhis secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.  He\nthrew himself into the sport with zest: he spoke to his sister-in-law,\nMiss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his\ntracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving\nthree completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a puzzle\nto the curious.  Many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose,\nespecially his intentions as to the hero.  Was Edwin Drood killed, or did\nhe escape?\n\nBy a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the late\nLord Lytton\u2019s tale for _All The Year Round_, \u201cThe Disappearance of John\nAckland,\u201d for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland\nwas alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (_All the Year\nRound_, September-October, 1869.)\n\nThe most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based on\ndeep knowledge of Dickens, is \u201cWatched by the Dead,\u201d by the late\ningenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much aid,\nis now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived \u201cthe auld\nmysterie,\u201d in his \u201cClues to Dickens\u2019s Edwin Drood\u201d (Chapman & Hall and\nHeywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to\ndissent.  Of Mr. Proctor\u2019s theory I offer some necessary corrections, and\nI hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor left in a\nstate of tangle.  As one read and re-read the fragment, points very dark\nseemed, at least, to become suddenly clear: especially one appeared to\nunderstand the meaning half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper\u2019s\nbabblings under the influence of opium.  He saw in his vision, \u201c_that_, I\nnever saw _that_ before.\u201d  We may be sure that he was to see \u201c_that_\u201d in\nreal life.  We must remember that, according to Forster, \u201csuch was\nDickens\u2019s interest in things supernatural that, but for the strong\nrestraining power of his common sense, he might have fallen into the\nfollies of spiritualism.\u201d  His interest in such matters certainly peeps\nout in this novel\u2014there are two specimens of the supernormal\u2014and he may\nhave gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am\nright, Dickens went further, and fared worse, in the too material\npremonitions of \u201cThe Signalman\u201d in _Mugby Junction_.\n\nWith this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens\u2019s last\nplot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made\nvaluable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.\n\n                                                              ANDREW LANG.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STORY\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6\n\n\nFOR the discovery of Dickens\u2019s secret in _Edwin Drood_ it is necessary to\nobtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their relations\nto each other.\n\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham, a\ncathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr. Bud,\nwho had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers\u2014somewhere.  They\nwere \u201cfast friends and old college companions.\u201d  Both married young.  Mr.\nBud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the father of one child, a\ndaughter, Rosa Bud.  Mr. Drood, whose wife\u2019s maiden name was Jasper, had\none son, Edwin Drood.  Mrs. Bud was drowned in a boating accident, when\nher daughter, Rosa, was a child.  Mr. Drood, already a widower, and the\nbereaved Mr. Bud \u201cbetrothed\u201d the two children, Rosa and Edwin, and then\nexpired, when the orphans were about seven and eleven years old.  The\nguardian of Rosa was a lawyer, Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with\nher mother.  To Grewgious Mr. Bud entrusted his wife\u2019s engagement ring,\nrubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to hand over to Edwin Drood, if,\nwhen he attained his majority, he and Rosa decided to marry.\n\nGrewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while Edwin\u2019s maternal\nuncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died), was\nEdwin\u2019s \u201ctrustee,\u201d as well as his uncle and devoted friend.  Rosa\u2019s\nlittle fortune was an annuity producing \u00a3250 a-year: Edwin succeeded to\nhis father\u2019s share in an engineering firm.\n\nWhen the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to proceed\nto Egypt, as an engineer.  Rosa, at school in Cloisterham, is about\nseventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.  He is conductor of the Choir of\nthe Cathedral, a \u201clay precentor;\u201d he is very dark, with thick black\nwhiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of\nopium smoking.  He began very early.  He takes this drug both in his\nlodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East London,\nkept by a woman nicknamed \u201cThe Princess Puffer.\u201d  This hag, we learn, has\nbeen a determined drunkard,\u2014\u201cI drank heaven\u2019s-hard,\u201d\u2014for sixteen years\n_before_ she took to opium.  If she has been dealing in opium for ten\nyears (the exact period is not stated), she has been very disreputable\nfor twenty-six years, that is ever since John Jasper\u2019s birth.  Mr. Cuming\nWalters suggests that she is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore,\nmaternal grandmother of Edwin Drood.  She detests her client, Jasper, and\nplays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.\n\nJasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the _fianc\u00e9e_ of his nephew, and\nhis own pupil in the musical art.  He makes her aware of his passion,\nsilently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions\nprivate.  She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on\nuncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps does love\nher, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their\nbetrothal.  \u201cThe bloom is off the plum\u201d of their prearranged loves, he\nsays to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed\npassion for Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.  Rosa is\naware of this fact; \u201ca glaze comes over his eyes,\u201d sometimes, she says,\n\u201cand he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream, in which he\nthreatens most . . . \u201d  The man appears to have these frightful dreams\neven when he is not under opium.\n\n\nOPENING OF THE TALE\n\n\nThe tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of\nCloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of the\nPrincess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag herself.  This\nCathedral tower, thus early and emphatically introduced, is to play a\ngreat but more or less mysterious part in the romance: that is certain.\nJasper, waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the\nLascar and Chinaman in their sleep.  He pronounces it \u201cunintelligible,\u201d\nwhich satisfies him that his own babble, when under opium, must be\nunintelligible also.  He is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of\nthe eastern coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he\nhope to understand the sleepers?  He is being watched by the hag, who\nhates him.\n\nJasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a\nnonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the\npink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow.  Jasper\ngives Edwin a dinner, and gushes over \u201chis bright boy,\u201d a lively lad,\nfull of chaff, but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of\nheart.  Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper admits that he\nloathes his life; and that the church singing \u201coften sounds to me quite\ndevilish,\u201d\u2014and no wonder.  After this dinner, Jasper has a \u201cweird\nseizure;\u201d \u201ca strange film comes over Jasper\u2019s eyes,\u201d he \u201clooks\nfrightfully ill,\u201d becomes rigid, and admits that he \u201chas been taking\nopium for a pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.\u201d  This \u201cagony,\u201d\nwe learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin speak lightly of his love, whom\nJasper so furiously desires.  \u201cTake it as a warning,\u201d Jasper says, but\nEdwin, puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not understand.\n\nIn the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and has\na tiff with Edwin.  Sir Luke Fildes\u2019s illustration shows Edwin as \u201ca lad\nwith the bloom of a lass,\u201d with a _classic profile_; _and a gracious head\nof long_, _thick_, _fair hair_, long, though we learn it has just been\ncut.  He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the period.\n\n\nSAPSEA AND DURDLES\n\n\nNext, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at\ntheir wine, expecting a third guest.  Mr. Sapsea reads his absurd epitaph\nfor his late wife, who is buried in a \u201cMonument,\u201d a vault of some sort in\nthe Cathedral churchyard.  To them enter Durdles, a man never sober, yet\ntrusted with the key of the crypt, \u201cas contractor for rough repairs.\u201d  In\nthe crypt \u201che habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor.\u201d",
                "-HUNTED DOWN [1860]-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I.\n\n\nMOST of us see some romances in life.  In my capacity as Chief Manager of\na Life Assurance Office, I think I have within the last thirty years seen\nmore romances than the generality of men, however unpromising the\nopportunity may, at first sight, seem.\n\nAs I have retired, and live at my ease, I possess the means that I used\nto want, of considering what I have seen, at leisure.  My experiences\nhave a more remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had when they were\nin progress.  I have come home from the Play now, and can recall the\nscenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the\nglare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.\n\nLet me recall one of these Romances of the real world.\n\nThere is nothing truer than physiognomy, taken in connection with manner.\nThe art of reading that book of which Eternal Wisdom obliges every human\ncreature to present his or her own page with the individual character\nwritten on it, is a difficult one, perhaps, and is little studied.  It\nmay require some natural aptitude, and it must require (for everything\ndoes) some patience and some pains.  That these are not usually given to\nit,\u2014that numbers of people accept a few stock commonplace expressions of\nthe face as the whole list of characteristics, and neither seek nor know\nthe refinements that are truest,\u2014that You, for instance, give a great\ndeal of time and attention to the reading of music, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Hebrew, if you please, and do not qualify yourself to read the\nface of the master or mistress looking over your shoulder teaching it to\nyou,\u2014I assume to be five hundred times more probable than improbable.\nPerhaps a little self-sufficiency may be at the bottom of this; facial\nexpression requires no study from you, you think; it comes by nature to\nyou to know enough about it, and you are not to be taken in.\n\nI confess, for my part, that I _have_ been taken in, over and over again.\nI have been taken in by acquaintances, and I have been taken in (of\ncourse) by friends; far oftener by friends than by any other class of\npersons.  How came I to be so deceived?  Had I quite misread their faces?\n\nNo.  Believe me, my first impression of those people, founded on face and\nmanner alone, was invariably true.  My mistake was in suffering them to\ncome nearer to me and explain themselves away.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II.\n\n\nTHE partition which separated my own office from our general outer office\nin the City was of thick plate-glass.  I could see through it what passed\nin the outer office, without hearing a word.  I had it put up in place of\na wall that had been there for years,\u2014ever since the house was built.  It\nis no matter whether I did or did not make the change in order that I\nmight derive my first impression of strangers, who came to us on\nbusiness, from their faces alone, without being influenced by anything\nthey said.  Enough to mention that I turned my glass partition to that\naccount, and that a Life Assurance Office is at all times exposed to be\npractised upon by the most crafty and cruel of the human race.\n\nIt was through my glass partition that I first saw the gentleman whose\nstory I am going to tell.\n\nHe had come in without my observing it, and had put his hat and umbrella\non the broad counter, and was bending over it to take some papers from\none of the clerks.  He was about forty or so, dark, exceedingly well\ndressed in black,\u2014being in mourning,\u2014and the hand he extended with a\npolite air, had a particularly well-fitting black-kid glove upon it.  His\nhair, which was elaborately brushed and oiled, was parted straight up the\nmiddle; and he presented this parting to the clerk, exactly (to my\nthinking) as if he had said, in so many words: \u2018You must take me, if you\nplease, my friend, just as I show myself.  Come straight up here, follow\nthe gravel path, keep off the grass, I allow no trespassing.\u2019\n\nI conceived a very great aversion to that man the moment I thus saw him.\n\nHe had asked for some of our printed forms, and the clerk was giving them\nto him and explaining them.  An obliged and agreeable smile was on his\nface, and his eyes met those of the clerk with a sprightly look.  (I have\nknown a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in\nthe face.  Don\u2019t trust that conventional idea.  Dishonesty will stare\nhonesty out of countenance, any day in the week, if there is anything to\nbe got by it.)\n\nI saw, in the corner of his eyelash, that he became aware of my looking\nat him.  Immediately he turned the parting in his hair toward the glass\npartition, as if he said to me with a sweet smile, \u2018Straight up here, if\nyou please.  Off the grass!\u2019\n\nIn a few moments he had put on his hat and taken up his umbrella, and was\ngone.\n\nI beckoned the clerk into my room, and asked, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\n\nHe had the gentleman\u2019s card in his hand.  \u2018Mr. Julius Slinkton, Middle\nTemple.\u2019\n\n\u2018A barrister, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018I think not, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have thought him a clergyman, but for his having no Reverend\nhere,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018Probably, from his appearance,\u2019 Mr. Adams replied, \u2018he is reading for\norders.\u2019\n\nI should mention that he wore a dainty white cravat, and dainty linen\naltogether.\n\n\u2018What did he want, Mr. Adams?\u2019\n\n\u2018Merely a form of proposal, sir, and form of reference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Recommended here?  Did he say?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, he said he was recommended here by a friend of yours.  He noticed\nyou, but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal\nacquaintance he would not trouble you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did he know my name?\u2019\n\n\u2018O yes, sir!  He said, \u201cThere _is_ Mr. Sampson, I see!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018A well-spoken gentleman, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Remarkably so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Insinuating manners, apparently?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very much so, indeed, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hah!\u2019 said I.  \u2018I want nothing at present, Mr. Adams.\u2019\n\nWithin a fortnight of that day I went to dine with a friend of mine, a\nmerchant, a man of taste, who buys pictures and books, and the first man\nI saw among the company was Mr. Julius Slinkton.  There he was, standing\nbefore the fire, with good large eyes and an open expression of face; but\nstill (I thought) requiring everybody to come at him by the prepared way\nhe offered, and by no other.\n\nI noticed him ask my friend to introduce him to Mr. Sampson, and my\nfriend did so.  Mr. Slinkton was very happy to see me.  Not too happy;\nthere was no over-doing of the matter; happy in a thoroughly well-bred,\nperfectly unmeaning way.\n\n\u2018I thought you had met,\u2019 our host observed.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Mr. Slinkton.  \u2018I did look in at Mr. Sampson\u2019s office, on your\nrecommendation; but I really did not feel justified in troubling Mr.\nSampson himself, on a point in the everyday routine of an ordinary\nclerk.\u2019\n\nI said I should have been glad to show him any attention on our friend\u2019s\nintroduction.\n\n\u2018I am sure of that,\u2019 said he, \u2018and am much obliged.  At another time,\nperhaps, I may be less delicate.  Only, however, if I have real business;\nfor I know, Mr. Sampson, how precious business time is, and what a vast\nnumber of impertinent people there are in the world.\u2019\n\nI acknowledged his consideration with a slight bow.  \u2018You were thinking,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018of effecting a policy on your life.\u2019\n\n\u2018O dear no!  I am afraid I am not so prudent as you pay me the compliment\nof supposing me to be, Mr. Sampson.  I merely inquired for a friend.  But\nyou know what friends are in such matters.  Nothing may ever come of it.\nI have the greatest reluctance to trouble men of business with inquiries\nfor friends, knowing the probabilities to be a thousand to one that the\nfriends will never follow them up.  People are so fickle, so selfish, so\ninconsiderate.  Don\u2019t you, in your business, find them so every day, Mr.\nSampson?\u2019\n\nI was going to give a qualified answer; but he turned his smooth, white\nparting on me with its \u2018Straight up here, if you please!\u2019 and I answered\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I hear, Mr. Sampson,\u2019 he resumed presently, for our friend had a new\ncook, and dinner was not so punctual as usual, \u2018that your profession has\nrecently suffered a great loss.\u2019\n\n\u2018In money?\u2019 said I.\n\nHe laughed at my ready association of loss with money, and replied, \u2018No,\nin talent and vigour.\u2019\n\nNot at once following out his allusion, I considered for a moment.\n\u2018_Has_ it sustained a loss of that kind?\u2019 said I.  \u2018I was not aware of\nit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understand me, Mr. Sampson.  I don\u2019t imagine that you have retired.  It\nis not so bad as that.  But Mr. Meltham\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018O, to be sure!\u2019 said I.  \u2018Yes!  Mr. Meltham, the young actuary of the\n\u201cInestimable.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Just so,\u2019 he returned in a consoling way.\n\n\u2018He is a great loss.  He was at once the most profound, the most\noriginal, and the most energetic man I have ever known connected with\nLife Assurance.\u2019\n\nI spoke strongly; for I had a high esteem and admiration for Meltham; and\nmy gentleman had indefinitely conveyed to me some suspicion that he\nwanted to sneer at him.  He recalled me to my guard by presenting that\ntrim pathway up his head, with its internal \u2018Not on the grass, if you\nplease\u2014the gravel.\u2019\n\n\u2018You knew him, Mr. Slinkton.\u2019\n\n\u2018Only by reputation.  To have known him as an acquaintance or as a\nfriend, is an honour I should have sought if he had remained in society,\nthough I might never have had the good fortune to attain it, being a man\nof far inferior mark.  He was scarcely above thirty, I suppose?\u2019\n\n\u2018About thirty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 he sighed in his former consoling way.  \u2018What creatures we are!  To\nbreak up, Mr. Sampson, and become incapable of business at that time of\nlife!\u2014Any reason assigned for the melancholy fact?\u2019\n\n(\u2018Humph!\u2019 thought I, as I looked at him.  \u2018But I WON\u2019T go up the track,\nand I WILL go on the grass.\u2019)\n\n\u2018What reason have you heard assigned, Mr. Slinkton?\u2019 I asked,\npoint-blank.\n\n\u2018Most likely a false one.  You know what Rumour is, Mr. Sampson.  I never\nrepeat what I hear; it is the only way of paring the nails and shaving\nthe head of Rumour.  But when _you_ ask me what reason I have heard\nassigned for Mr. Meltham\u2019s passing away from among men, it is another\nthing.  I am not gratifying idle gossip then.  I was told, Mr. Sampson,\nthat Mr. Meltham had relinquished all his avocations and all his\nprospects, because he was, in fact, broken-hearted.  A disappointed\nattachment I heard,\u2014though it hardly seems probable, in the case of a man\nso distinguished and so attractive.\u2019\n\n\u2018Attractions and distinctions are no armour against death,\u2019 said I.\n\n\u2018O, she died?  Pray pardon me.  I did not hear that.  That, indeed, makes\nit very, very sad.  Poor Mr. Meltham!  She died?  Ah, dear me!\nLamentable, lamentable!\u2019\n\nI still thought his pity was not quite genuine, and I still suspected an\nunaccountable sneer under all this, until he said, as we were parted,\nlike the other knots of talkers, by the announcement of dinner:\n\n\u2018Mr. Sampson, you are surprised to see me so moved on behalf of a man\nwhom I have never known.  I am not so disinterested as you may suppose.\nI have suffered, and recently too, from death myself.  I have lost one of\ntwo charming nieces, who were my constant companions.  She died\nyoung\u2014barely three-and-twenty; and even her remaining sister is far from\nstrong.  The world is a grave!\u2019\n\nHe said this with deep feeling, and I felt reproached for the coldness of\nmy manner.  Coldness and distrust had been engendered in me, I knew, by\nmy bad experiences; they were not natural to me; and I often thought how\nmuch I had lost in life, losing trustfulness, and how little I had\ngained, gaining hard caution.  This state of mind being habitual to me, I\ntroubled myself more about this conversation than I might have troubled\nmyself about a greater matter.  I listened to his talk at dinner, and\nobserved how readily other men responded to it, and with what a graceful\ninstinct he adapted his subjects to the knowledge and habits of those he\ntalked with.",
                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!",
                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost.",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within.",
                "-AN EPOCH IN HISTORY-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the author to take part in a movement\nwithout precedent in the history of the world, and the incidents\nconcurrent with, together with those subsequent to that movement, have\nfurnished the material for this book. It has been the object of the\nwriter to weave into the story of his actual experiences an account of\nthose things which are as yet an unexplored field in the realm of\nletters. The work is submitted to the reader in the hope that it will\nprove to be pregnant with interest to those who are in sympathy with\ngreat movements and to those who listen with delight to stories of\npersonal experiences in distant lands and among strange peoples.\n\n                                                       THE AUTHOR.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.\n\n\nFew people pause to think that Tuesday, the twenty-third day of July,\nnineteen hundred and one, not only placed a mile-stone on the road of\ncivilization, but also marked an epoch in the history of the world.\n\nThat day placed a mile-stone on the road of civilization because it\nsaw the culmination of one of the greatest movements ever attempted in\nbehalf of common school education. It marked an epoch in the history\nof the world because, for the first time within the knowledge of man,\na conquering people, instead of sending battalions of soldiers to hold\nthe conquered in subjection, sent a carefully selected body of men and\nwomen to carry to them the benefits of a highly developed society.\n\nIt was on this day that the United States Government sent from San\nFrancisco four hundred and ninety-nine trained men and women to\nestablish throughout the Philippine Islands a system of free public\nschools.\n\nThe ball on the tower of the Ferry Building in San Francisco had just\nfallen, announcing the hour of noon on the one hundred and twentieth\nmeridian, when the propellers began revolving and the United States\nArmy Transport \"Thomas\" swung out into the middle of the bay, where it\ndropped anchor for a few moments while some belated boxes of lemons\nand a few other articles were added to the equipment of the steward's\ndepartment.\n\nThe anchor was again on its way to the surface when a row-boat driven\nby four oarsmen with drawn muscles and clenched teeth glided in under\nthe bow of the ship. Its passenger, a belated teacher who at the last\nmoment had wandered from the pier, was shouting for some one to throw\nhim a rope, and a few moments later our last passenger whose silvery\nhair little indicated the probability of such a blunder was landed in\na heap on the deck. Our ship was now under way and soon passed out of\nthe Golden Gate bearing on and between her decks the largest number of\nteachers as well as the largest cargo of pedagogical equipment that\nany vessel in the history of the world ever bore to a foreign land to\ninstruct an alien people. Late in the afternoon five whales came up\nand spouted and played around us. We passed on and as their fountains\nof spray disappeared in the distance the sun sank down to pay his\nwonted devotion before the shrine of night. We were alone.\n\nBy good fortune we went by way of the Hawaiian Islands and touched at\nHonolulu. We entered the harbor in the first faint light of the coming\nmorn while the moon still shone with resplendent glory just above the\nnearer rim of the old extinct volcanic crater lying just behind the\ntown. High points of land lay around us on three sides, while across\nthe bay soft billowy clouds completed an enchanting circle from the\nspell of which none of us wished ever to escape.\n\nNo traveler who lands at Honolulu will feel unrequited for his time\nand his money should he visit two places in the vicinity of the town.\n\nThe first is the Pali and the second, the Bishop Museum of\nPolynesian Ethnology.\n\nThe first is a gigantic precipice, reached by a few hours ride from\nthe city by horse. As one reaches the precipice, there spreads out\nbefore him at a dizzying depth below a verdant plain, bounded in the\ndistance by an emerald sea. The wind which always blows in tropical\ncountries is gathered in between the long projecting arms of a\nmountain chain and rushes over the face of cliff with such force that\nit is said by travelers to be one of the strongest continual winds on\nthe globe.\n\nThe Bishop Museum of Polynesian Ethnology contains the finest\ncollection in existence of things illustrating the life and customs of\nPolynesia. Among other things, the visitor is shown the personal god\nof war of that sovereign whose grand-child was the last to hold the\nsceptre of the Kanakas. There are royal documents to prove that more\nthan one thousand men have been beheaded before this grim-faced old\nidol. Here, too, is the famous robe of birds' feathers, made to please\nthe fancy of this same grim old monarch. The feathers of which this\nstrange, but really elegant, robe is made are of a reddish color. The\nbirds from which they were plucked were found only in the Hawaiian\nIslands and each bird had only four feathers, two being under each\nwing. The extinction of the bird is attributed to the making of this\nroyal robe. So many of them were needed that hundreds of hunters were\nemployed a score or more of years to secure the number required.\n\nPlacing the wages of the hunters at a reasonable figure, the value of\nthe robe is over three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAt Honolulu one sees also that famous sport of the South Sea\nIslanders, surf-shooting. The native wades far out into the surf\nwith a long narrow board and then sits astride of it upon the surface\nof the water. As the long billows come rolling in, he places his board\nupon the convex surface of an advancing wave, then, with the poise of\na rope-dancer, he places his weight properly upon the plank and is\nshot forward with precipitate rapidity.\n\nBetween Honolulu and Manila lies the imaginary line where the days of\nthe week are supposed to begin and end. It has long been a custom\namong sailors to hold the \"Revels of Neptune\" on the night after a\nvessel crosses either the International Date Line or the Equator, and\nthe ship is then turned over to the crew. Even the petty officers of\nthe ship are not free from being made the objects of the sport, and\npassengers of especial prominence have often been treated to a bath in\na tub of cold water or had their faces lathered with a broom as a\nshaving brush while a bar of old iron served the purpose of a razor.\n\nA naval lieutenant on the battleship which conveyed Napoleon from\nLondon to St. Helena, writing to one of the court ladies in London,\nstates that Napoleon offered the sailors four hundred dollars in gold\nand actually gave them eighty-five dollars to escape being ducked in a\ntub of cold water and shaved with a rough iron hoop when they crossed\nthe equator.\n\n     Century Magazine for September, 1889.\n\nWe reached the line on Thursday night and awoke a few hours later on\nSaturday morning, having lost a day in revelry.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II. - MANILA.\n\n\nOne would imagine the water of Manila Bay to be as tranquil as a lake\nshould conclusions be drawn from its almost landlocked position. On\nthe contrary, it is noted among sailors the world over for the\nroughness of its waters; and a breakwater behind which ships can lie\nin quiet and take on or discharge their cargoes is essential to the\nproper development of the city's shipping. But, so far as we were\nconcerned, this was a possible joy of the future. So, one by one we\ndescended the narrow stairway at the side of the ship, and then leaped\nat opportune moments to the decks of the dancing steam launches below.\n\nHow it ever came to pass that each of us, ladies and all, in\nsuccession went through with this mid-air acrobatic performance\nwithout serious accident is a matter of profound wonder; but we did,\nand the launches when loaded danced away over the bay and entered the\nmouth of the Pasig River. At the wharf we were informally introduced\nto a crowd of curious natives. The men wore hat, shirt, and pants, and\nsome of them wore shoes. The women wore a sort of low-necked body with\ngreat wide sleeves and a skirt not cut to fit the body, but of the\nsame size at both bottom and top, the upper end not being belted or\ntied, but just drawn tightly around the waist and the surplus part\nknotted and tucked with the thumb under the part already wrapped\naround the body. The long, black, glossy hair of the young women hung\nloosely down their backs, in many cases reaching below the hips--heads\nof hair that almost any lady would be proud to own. Many of the women\nhad in their mouths long poorly-made cigars that were wrapped and tied\nwith small white threads to hold them together while the lady owners\nchewed and pulled away with vigor at the end opposite the fire.\n\nThe time of our landing was in the midst of the rainy season, and our\nclothing each morning when we arose to dress was as wet as if it had\njust come from a wringer. Our underclothing could be drawn on only\nwith difficulty and the excessive disagreeableness of the feeling\nadded no little to the discomfort of the situation.\n\nWhen the Spaniard, attracted by riches of these distant islands that\nhe had named for his King Philip, built the city of Manila, he modeled\nit after the mediaeval towns of his European home. And it is well that\nhe did so, for, if we give credence to the city's history, its early\nlife was not one of undisturbed quiet. Not to mention the sea-rovers\nof those early times who paid their piratical respects to the town,\nlegend has it that this old wall has saved the city on two separate\noccasions from bands of Moros sweeping northward from the southern\nislands. So Manila consists of two parts, the city \"intra muros\" and\nthe new city which has sprung up around it.\n\nIt was on the morning following our landing that I first stood upon\nthe old stone bridge that for one hundred and fifty years has borne\nthe traffic between the old city and the new. The strokes of eight\no'clock were pealing forth from the tower of a neighboring ecclesia\nwhen I purposely took this station that I might see the current of\nManila's life when flowing at its height.\n\nAt short intervals along the entire length of the bridge stood in its\ncenter a line of well-shaped American policemen in neat Khaki\nuniforms and russet leather leggins. Thousands of pedestrians were\npouring across the bridge in a ceaseless stream. Between the two lines\nof pedestrians moved in opposite directions two lines of vehicles and\ncarts. It was indeed a cosmopolitan mixture of people. There were\nEnglish bankers, French jewelers, German chemists, Spanish merchants,\nforeign consuls, officers and privates of the American army, seamen\nfrom foreign warships lying in the bay, Chinese of all classes and\nconditions from silk-clad bankers to almost naked coolies trotting\nalong with burdens swung over their shoulders. There were Japanese,\nand East India merchants from Bombay and Calcutta, and, finally, all\nclasses and conditions of Filipinos apparently representing all of the\nseventeen separate branches of the race,--each individual in this\nwonderful stream following the channel of his own necessities.\n\nIn the river beneath were steam launches towing all kinds of small\ncrafts. Along the bank of the stream below the bridge were\ninter-island steamers packed so closely along the shore that one could\nalmost have stepped from one to another. Into every nook and corner\nbetween the steamers were crowded small odd looking boats loaded with\nnative produce over which the owners kept up an incessant chatter.\n\nAll of us remained in Manila for about two weeks awaiting assignment\nto our stations. One may well imagine our consternation on awaking one\nmorning about the end of the second week to find the following notice\nposted throughout all our quarters:\n    All teachers not assigned to the city of Manila or to Iloilo\n    should supply themselves with the following articles:\n       ",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart.",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain.",
                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771).",
                "-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-\n\n\nCHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.\n\n\nIt was towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt\nin the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land\nof Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours was no ordinary\njourney by rail, which is the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.\n\nWhat we wanted was in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,\nthe road taken by the famous company of bygone days, setting out from the\nhostelrie where these lordings lay one night and held counsel, making\nstations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,\nas they did, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the\nCanterbury Cathedral. How better could this be done than by riding over\nthe ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?\n\nAnd so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags\nto our machine and wheeled out of Russell Square before any one was\nstirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after\ndoor. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the\npale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race\nus; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and\nunder Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and\nover London Bridge, where the mist was heavy on the river and the barges\nshowed spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greeted us after their\nfashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll catch up if\nyou try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second\nstory?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we had a\nglimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'\nand then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to\nhave been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the\nfirst time, could we start from nothing? If ours had no beginning, would\nit be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very\noutset. But our enthusiasm was fresh. We looked up at the old sign of\n'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building\nwhich has replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, was something\nsubstantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.\n\nThen we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is laid with\nBelgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where\nin one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to pass around\nit our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we had to dismount\nand lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he looked on. If he had his\nway, he said, he would burn all them things. We came to Deptford, or\nWest Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his\nfellows passed. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes\nopposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tiled roofs\nand clustered chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant\nchurch steeple, its outline softened in the silvery mist, for the fog was\ngrowing less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the\n'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rested there said\nthat an old fountain had stood in the open space near by, it pleased us to\nthink that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where\npilgrims to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this\nvery spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travelled the same\nroad, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a\ndonkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we came to Blackheath, where\nsheep were peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three\nbicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the\n'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it\non her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to\nour left.\n\nAfter Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet\nair, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty\ncottages by which we wheeled. Red-coated soldiers turned to look and dogs\nran out to bark at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes\nand rakes to stare. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and\nsunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind\nwhen, at a few minutes before nine, we drew up on the bridge at Crayford.\n\nIt seemed at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on\nthe bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoking their morning pipes, and\nas many boys were leaning over the wall, lazily staring into the river\nbelow, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the\nhillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock struck\nnine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the\nlittle river Cray began to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the\nashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But\ntheir evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, came\nout, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried\nto work. A man with a cart full of shining onions went by, and we followed\nhim up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be\ntrying to climb one over the other to reach a terrace of shining white\nhouses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall\nchimney-pot threw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next\nto it. On a short strip of ground which stretched along the terrace\npatches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place\nthere were stalks of pink hollyhock and poles covered with vines, and in\nthe windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a\nfeeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. took out his\nsketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing\nby, had come out and were standing in their small gardens. When they saw\nthe sketch-book they posed as if for a photographer--all except one old\nwoman, who hobbled down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well\nwe did not hear what she said, for I think she was cursing us. When she\nwas close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she\nlooked like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's\ntakin' of yere likenesses. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell\nupon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.\n\nThere were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, were on machines,\nbut the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and\npoor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were\nmonasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at\nnight, now they must find shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,\nhowever, did not seem hard. It is sweet to lie beneath the sky now as it\nwas when Daphnis sang. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf\nwas luxury compared to the beds they had just left, for they belonged to\nthe large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to make\nthe Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.\n\nWhitechapel and other low quarters are nearly emptied at this season. It\nis pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escape from\ntheir smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe\npure air, but their coming is not welcomed in the country. Many poor,\nhonest women in towns and villages thereabouts will rather lose a few\nshillings than let their children go to the hop-fields during the picking\nseason, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As\nwe rode further the number of tramps increased; all the morning we passed\nand overtook them. There were grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who\nhobbled painfully along, and could scarcely keep pace with their more\nstalwart sons and daughters; there were children by the score, some of\nwhom ran gaily on, forgetting fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others\nlagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others were borne in their\nmothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household\ngoods and gods. They carried heavy bags thrown over their shoulders, or\nelse baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all\nmanner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the\nothers, had brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hidden\nin a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, were sleeping in it, and\none clasped a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we\ncame suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we rang our\nbell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk\nhandkerchief he was holding; and now we came to a man and woman resting on\na pile of stones by the roadside, who sat upright at the tinkling of our\nbell. I shall never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she\nturned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an\nIndian's, hanging about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was\nunmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save\nevil--compared to hers an idiot's face would have been intelligent, a\nbrute's refined. I could now understand why honest countrywomen kept\ntheir children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps were as\ncareless and jolly as B\u00e9ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and made merry as\nif the world and its hardships were but jests. We, as figures in the\nfarce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'That's right! ladies fust!'\none old tattered and torn man called after us, gaily; 'that's the\nprinciple on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, is a rough way of\nsaying 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.\n\n'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walking with him, as we\ncoasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'ere's a lady and gen'leman on\na happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'They're only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'\nan old hag of the party added; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed\nloud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their\nlaughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.\n\nDartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between\ntwo hills, one of which is good to coast, the other hard to climb. The\nplace, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and\ncarriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that runs\nnear a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from\none side instead of from the centre, which is the proper place for clocks.\n\nFrom Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.\n\nHere and there were brown fields, where men were ploughing, or perhaps\nburning heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke\nheavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners were busy,\nand then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant\ncabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loving cattle were\ngrazing, stretched as far as the eye could see. To the north, every now\nand then, as the road turned, we saw the river, where ships were at\nanchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with\ndark-red sails, were floating down with the tide. The water was blue as\nthe sky, and the hills in the distance seemed to melt into a soft purple\nmist hanging over them. By the road and by the river were many deep\ndeserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while\nthey brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages built at\ntheir feet.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris.",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.",
                "-INSPIRATION: ITS NATURE AND EXTENT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is quite impossible to over-estimate the deep importance of this great\nsubject, for on our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence\nin all the great mysteries of the Gospel.  There is a sphere within which\nthe human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I would be the\nlast to undervalue human intellect.  It has done vast things already, and\nis doing great things now.  But there is a limit beyond which it has no\npower to pass; a world in which it has no means of investigation; an\nunseen kingdom which lies quite outside its range.  Yet, though unseen,\nthis kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it is\none in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all rapidly\nhastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator, our Redeemer,\nour Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of it.  Thus, no science\ncan ever inform us as to the nature of the Godhead, the plan of\nsalvation, or eternal life; and it is altogether unphilosophical and\nunscientific to attempt to reduce such subjects to the ordinary rules of\nscience and philosophy.  God\u2019s plan of salvation can only be known from\nGod Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all needful knowledge\nrespecting it, there is no human power that can ever supply the\ndeficiency, and we must live and die convinced of the soul\u2019s immortality,\nbut still in utter ignorance of the plan which God has arranged for its\nsafety.  Hence the inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.\n\nIt is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things of the\nunseen world.  It supplies that which lies beyond the reach of human\ninvestigation, and gives us exactly that information which dying man\nrequires.  It unfolds to us the eternal nature of God, and the plan of\nsalvation which He has prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.  If\ntherefore our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we\ncannot rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any trustworthy\ninformation as to all those great truths which most deeply concern us.\n\nIf we cannot rely on Scripture as a communication from God we have\nnothing to take its place; and all our present joy, as well as our future\nhopes, must melt away into utter ignorance respecting all that lies\nbeyond the range of science, and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this\npresent world.\n\nIt is not my present object to attempt to prove the inspiration of\nScripture.  It is a great and noble subject, and one which I should\nrejoice to investigate.  But it is not the subject of this paper.  My\nobject is to examine the extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I\nmust exclusively confine myself.  I take it for granted therefore that\ninspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to consider\nhow far it carries us, and what security it gives us for certain,\nreliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the inspired word.\n\nIt has been said that \u2018Inspiration is that idea of Scripture which we\ngather from the knowledge of it,\u2019  and an attempt has been made to\nshow how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.  I freely\ngrant that such a theory does present a very easy and ready method of\ngetting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on reducing the authority of\nScripture to our own ideas respecting it, it is not likely that there\nwill be much left to embarrass us.  There is however one difficulty, and\nthat a most important one, which it cannot solve.  It can give no solid\nfoundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us floating\ninto eternity with no better support than a vague idea of our own\ncreation.\n\nSt. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay; for though\nthe author boldly asserts that  \u2018for any of the higher or\nsupernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the Gospels\nor Epistles,\u2019 St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts that \u2018Holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u2019 (2 Pet. i. 21.)  Here then\nwe have the Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that\ndefinition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to be\nconsidered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy Ghost\nmoved the writers; and the human, for the communication did not come as a\ndirect voice from heaven, but holy men spake as they were moved.\n\nIn order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will be necessary\nto examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human element, and (3) the\ncombination of the two; after which we may consider some of the\ndifficulties which have been thought to lie against the doctrine.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE DIVINE ELEMENT.\n\n\nI NEED scarcely say that this divine element is the great subject of\nmodern controversy.  But I hope we may meet the points more especially\nagitated, by considering four questions.\n\n  I.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\n  II.  Is it equal?\n\n  III.  Is it verbal?\n\n  IV.  Does it render the word infallible?\n\nI.  Does it extend over the whole book?\n\nOur first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by it; or, in\nother words, to the question, Is the whole inspired?  Were all the\nwriters of Scripture thus moved by the Holy Ghost? or merely some of\nthem, and those in certain books only?\n\nNow, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our guide, we\nhave a clear and decisive answer; for it is here written, \u2018All Scripture\nis given by inspiration of God.\u2019  It is stated by Dr. Lee  that the\nword \u2018Scripture\u2019 occurs either in the singular or plural no less than\nfifty times, and in every single instance it is employed solely with\nreference to that collection of writings which were regarded as the\noracles of God.  Everything therefore included in that collection is here\ndeclared to be \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, or given by inspiration.\n\nThe only possible question therefore is, How much was included?\n\nNow, whatever men may think of the doctrine of inspiration, all must\nadmit as an historical fact, that when St. Paul wrote these words, the\nwhole of the Old Testament was included in the Jewish canon.  The Jews,\nnotwithstanding all their faults, were admirable guardians of Scripture,\nand there was no doubt in the mind of any pious Jew as to what books\ntogether formed his Bible.  He was much clearer on that subject than many\nof our modern writers.  When therefore St. Paul spoke of \u2018All Scripture,\u2019\nthere is no doubt in the world that he included in his statement every\nline and letter of the Old Testament, and he taught us in those words\nthat the whole, from first to last, from the first of Genesis to the last\nof Malachi was given by inspiration of God.\n\nIn saying this, I make no exception whatever with reference to the\nhistorical books.  I think it has been clearly shown that those\nhistorical writings which are not in the Pentateuch are included in that\npart of Scripture called the Prophets.  In which case the language of St.\nPeter, already quoted, refers to history as well as prediction.  Nay,\nmore!  I do not hesitate to say, that if I were called upon to prove\ninspiration, there is no portion of the whole volume on which I should be\nbetter pleased to meet an opponent than the historical portions of the\nOld Testament.  So strong is the argument in their favour, that although\nby so saying I may startle some, I am prepared, after the most careful\ndeliberation, to affirm that I cannot separate them from the word of God\nwithout at the same time abandoning the whole of my Christianity.  My\nreason for this statement is, that our Lord Himself in His own teaching\nhas most distinctly sanctioned them.  Men cavil at the strange miracles\nrecorded in them, but, while men cavil, He refers to no less than nine of\nthese miracles as facts.  The flood, the destruction of Sodom and\nGomorrah, the death of Lot\u2019s wife, the burning bush, the manna, the\nbrazen serpent, the cure of Naaman, the preservation of the widow of\nSarepta, and the rescue of Jonah, are all endorsed by His divine\nauthority.  To the books of Moses, which are chiefly historical, He\nperpetually refers as to the word of God, describing their testimony as\nmore worthy of credit than that of men risen from the dead.  And as for\nthe much-despised first chapter of the book of Genesis, the speculation,\nas we are now taught, of some ancient Hebrew Descartes, He actually\nquotes the 27th verse as descriptive of the fact of creation.  I am\nbrought therefore to the conclusion that if there is any portion of the\nwhole volume which may pre-eminently be said to have the broad seal and\nstamp of our Lord\u2019s authority placed upon it with His own hand, that\nportion is the Pentateuch.  All, therefore, I am thoroughly persuaded,\nmust rise and fall together.  If we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we\nmust receive the books of Moses as inspired Scripture; and never can we\nabandon them till we are prepared to admit that in His own sacred\nteaching the Lord Himself has misled His people, or, in other and plainer\nwords, till we cease to be believers in Jesus.\n\nBut are we to limit this language of St. Paul to the Old Testament?  I\nthink it has been clearly shown that we are not.  For although the canon\nof the New Testament was not complete when St. Paul wrote these words, we\nmust remember that the second Epistle to Timothy was one of the latest\nepistles, and that, according to Horne\u2019s list, the whole of the New\nTestament, or very nearly the whole, except the writings of St. John,\nwere written at or about the time of its publication.  The only question\nis, whether these writings were then regarded as Scripture: for, if they\nwere, they were clearly included in the declaration that all Scripture is\ngiven by inspiration of God.  Now, one thing is perfectly clear, namely,\nthat St. Paul claimed the authority of Scripture for his own epistles:\nfor after having carefully drawn the distinction between his private\nopinions and inspired decisions, he distinctly says, \u2018Yet not I, but the\nLord\u2019 (1 Cor. vii. 10).  It is equally clear that St. Peter classed the\napostles with the prophets, 2 Pet. iii. 2.  It is equally clear again,\nthat the Gospel of St. Luke was already admitted as Scripture, for in 1\nTim. v. 18, St. Paul quotes two passages, one from Deuteronomy and one\nfrom St. Luke, declaring of both equally that they were taken from\nScripture.  \u2018For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn.  And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.\u2019\n(Deut. xxv. 4; Luke, x. 7.)  It is equally clear again, that St. Paul\u2019s\nEpistles were included by St. Peter in the canon; for he clearly regarded\nthem as Scripture when he wrote his second epistle.  He saw some\ndifficulties in them, but that did not affect his opinion of their\nadmitted inspiration, when he said (2 Pet. iii. 15, 16), \u2018Even as our\nbeloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath\nwritten unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these\nthings; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that\nare unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,\nunto their own destruction.\u2019\nNew Testament therefore, as well as Old, was included in the declaration,\n\u2018All scripture is given by inspiration of God;\u2019 and the conclusion to\nwhich I am irresistibly brought is, that we have no right to pick and\nchoose amongst the various portions of the word of God.  I believe the\nwhole to be arranged as a whole for the accomplishment of God\u2019s great\npurpose, that the whole is included in \u2018the Scriptures,\u2019 and that the\nparts are so interwoven one with another, and so beautifully fitted into\neach other by God\u2019s divine hand, that there will be found ultimately to\nbe no intermediate path between receiving the whole as the word of God,\nor sweeping away the whole.",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie.",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted."
